	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Meadowcroft 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The last time that you and I served together on a Committee—the local government paving Bill—it took rather longer than I suspect this one will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask this in an air of innocence, so that you will not think that I am being at all disrespectful. I notice that you have chosen not to select the long amendment, amendment No. 28, which probes all the difficult problems. May I ask, for my own information and guidance, whether that is because the amendment was felt to be out of order or because you did not think that it was worth debating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to the hon. Member. I have been rather busy this week and I must confess that it has just been brought to my notice. The fact of the matter is that it is out of order. Secondly, I note that the Committee is in a very good mood. I suspect that with good will we may finish this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>MEANING OF "SURROGATE MOTHER" "SURROGACY ARRANGEMENT" AND OTHER TERMS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. JO Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 4, leave out " or understanding ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 7, leave out " or understanding ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although with my colleague I have put down a number of amendments I have no intention of keeping the Committee for long, because obviously we support the Bill. I have sought to formulate queries that are in my mind and in the minds of others in an exploratory way rather than in a wrecking way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments seek to leave out the words " or understanding" in subsection (4), where the Bill refers to " a promise or understanding ". I am not clear what the difference is between " promise " and " understanding ". I take it that an understanding is a slightly less rigid form of a promise. I have looked to see what "understanding" means, and find it extremely vague. It strikes me that it would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
be sensible to have a more precise word instead of " or understanding ", which might give rise to difficulties of interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave it at that for the moment and await what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Lady has very fairly moved her amendment more by way of a query, and I quite understand her raising the question. I do not always instinctively leap to the defence of the drafting of Bills as they first arrive before a Standing Committee, but on this occasion I think that the wording that is used is very near that of ordinary, day-to-day, conversational English. I cannot see how it could be improved or made clearer. If we simply left out the words " or understanding" it would weaken the force of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the meaning of that phrase as it stands is that a promise has a certain binding quality about it, if only in honour. If a person promises that he will do something, he is committing himself to carrying it out. An understanding is something short of that. It applies in cases where one has not actually promised to do something but the other person has been left in the expectation that something will be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these words were omitted there might be arguments before the courts on the question whether a certain arrangement was sufficient to amount to a promise do not want to invent the kind of thing that might amount to an understanding, but if the woman in question were left with the feeling that she would be all right, or would be looked after, or that something would be done for her, and it did not go beyond that, it is conceivable that later, when the matter came before a court, there would be a great deal of argument whether such a thing amounted to a promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill attempts to catch any arrangements where there is an underlying belief that a payment is likely to be made in the end. I think that that makes the Bill more effective. To leave out the words " or understanding " would weaken it, and one can imagine arguments whether certain forms of words did or did not amount to a promise on the part of one person to hand over money to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that context, would it not have been useful to define the word " commercial"? The clause defines a number of expressions and tries to deal with the question of money in subsection (4). I accept what the Minister says about the drafting being deliberately very subtle—I accept the skill of it—in drawing the question of commercial arrangements out of the Unborn Children (Protection) Bill introduced by the right hon. Member for South Down (Mr. Powell). In this context, the word " commercial" is not defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word " commercial " is defined in clause 2(3), where it is made clear for the purposes of the clause. This definition is therefore for the purposes of the Bill only, and makes it clear what we mean when we talk about a person doing an act on a commercial basis. I think that both points
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0932">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
raised so far have been covered. Were the hon. Lady to press the amendment she would, inadvertently, possibly weaken the effect of the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the amendment, but I am not happy about it. I can see that all sorts of problems could arise if a case arose in which there was not a promise that was binding and that we all understood; but an understanding is so difficult to define that there might be problems about whose word was to be accepted when one person said that there was an understanding and another person said that his or her understanding was quite different. I have no wish to weaken the Bill, but it struck me that the word was so vague that a coach and horses might be driven through it—I do not know in which direction. I wanted to clarify the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 13, leave out " insertion " and insert " transfer ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a drafting amendment, which relates to the discussions to which only the Minister of Health was privy on the Unborn Children (Protection) Bill when we sought, as we saw it, to insert the correct medical term. Instead of " embryo insertion ", which is the term in the Bill and in the Unborn Children (Protection) Bill, we understand and have checked from medical sources that the correct term is " embryo transfer ". It is purely a drafting matter, and I shall not go to the stake about it, but it would be a pity not to get it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. John Patten)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can reassure myself that that is purely a semantic point and that we are putting it on all fours with common medical usage we will seek to consider the point further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdraw</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5 in page 2, line 19, leave out from " lawful" to end of line 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 20, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(10) No contract for a surrogacy arrangement will be enforceable at law by or against any persons making it.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are exploratory and probing amendments, to see whether my own understanding of what is intended by the Bill is accurate or whether there are improvements that might be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first amendment I am seeking to delete the second part of subsection (9). This deals with the question of the difference between a crime and a contract. If the purpose behind the Bill is to define what the Government mean by commercial surrogacy and what should be lawful and unlawful it seems odd to go beyond that by saying that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
are not necessarily sure whether matters fall into law in terms of the Bill, so they need to go beyond that to decide whether there is some kind of enforceability that cannot accurately be held to be lawful or unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) raised the matter on Second Reading when he said:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State seemed to take the view that the law as it stood was quite clear and that no such contract—a contract to hand over the baby, or the money— would be enforceable in the courts. If the right hon. Gentleman had any doubts on that point some provision should be included in the Bill. If he is wholly satisfied that the law provides no opportunity for enforcing contracts between the mother, the agency and the prospective parents, he should say so."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 April 1985; Vol. 77, c.35–36.]</p></q>
There is a strange dichotomy in the clause. It tries to define what is lawful and what is not and says that there are things that might be enforceable or not enforceable. Warnock took a much stronger view; the report recommended, in paragraph 8.19:
	<br><q><p>" that it be provided by statute that all surrogacy agreements are illegal contracts and therefore unenforceable in the courts."</p></q>
It would have been better to make that quite clear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 endeavours to deal with the point by adding, at the end of the clause, a subsection providing that:
	<br><q><p>"No contract for a surrogacy arrangement will be enforceable at law by or against any persons making it."</p></q>
That is the appropriate place in the Bill to make it clear that whatever kind of contract or arrangement people make it should not be enforceable. I should be happy to have guidance on the interpretation of that point, to see whether or not I should press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reasonably encouraging in my response to the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) when he raised this matter on Second Reading. I am happy to continue to consider the point today and to explain to the Committee what our thinking is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to make the activities of commercial agencies illegal and criminal, but it does not affect so-called voluntary surrogacy arrangements between relatives, friends, or people doing these things on a non-commercial basis. The amendment would seek to make all contracts of surrogacy unenforceable at law. Undoubtedly that was also the recommendation of the Warnock committee, who, by a majority, recommended that all surrogacy arrangements, whether commercial or non-commercial, should be made illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had some difficulty in deciding how far we should go in the Bill which is considering commercial surrogacy only. There are certain aspects of any surrogacy arrangement that most people would like to see made unenforceable. Indeed, as I have said before and I think most people have agreed, it is strongly arguable that most features of a surrogacy contract are unenforceable, and if anybody ever tried to enforce a surrogacy bargain by going to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
courts they would be told that it was illegal because it was contrary to public policy to enforce it, but that has never been determined. We do not have any case law. Therefore, there is an argument, as the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was saying, that we might take the opportunity of making this absolutely clear and beyond doubt by putting it into the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, so good, I hope, if I made it clear. The only question that then arises, certainly in my mind, and the question that the Government think they would like to consider further, is whether it is actually the opinion of the House given the choice, that absolutely every feature of a surrogacy arrangement, even a voluntary one, should be made illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hazard my personal opinion. I would have thought that it should be made unenforceable that the mother should be compelled to hand over the child. Nobody wishes to see a surrogacy contract enforced with a surrogate mother who changed her mind being obliged to hand over the child. That is straightforward. I certainly think, and it is consistent with the Bill, that any agreement to pay a fee to the surrogate mother for her services—for the leasing of the womb—might be made unenforceable. Some people might object to that, but I think most would agree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, as a result of some purely voluntary arrangement—let us take the least harmful of all, in the opinion of some—there has been an agreement between sisters that some kind of medical expenses are to be paid on behalf of the surrogate mother, and there has been an agreement that the surrogate mother is to give up her job, so that the would-be parent is going to pay for the costs suffered during the pregnancy by the surrogate mother giving up her job in order to bear the child, we are not entirely sure that we would wish to make that unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the amendment, moved in the terms that it was by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Meadowcroft), makes each and every aspect of an arrangement of that kind completely unenforceable, with resulting hardship. The problem will obviously be totally resolved if, when we get to what we are all describing as the full Warnock Bill, the House decides to make illegal all surrogacy arrangements, voluntary or commercial, or whatever. I imagine that the House will then go rushing on to say that such arrangements should be unenforceable in every respect. But if, in the end, we decide that there is scope for some voluntary surrogacy, we must be careful about exactly what we are saying should be unenforceable in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I probably have not been very helpful to the hon. Member, because I merely rehearsed the difficulties that stop me from immediately agreeing to the amendment. What I will undertake is that we will consider the point. There are obvious essential points that most people would like us to sort out and put in statutory form. If we can produce a satisfactory solution, either in this House or in another place, we shall be happy to put forward
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
amendments that will put the matter beyond doubt, without giving rise to any harmful and unintended side-effects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister said. One other thing that might be considered in another place is the fact that there is an argument also that by having written in what is enforceable and what is not is the precise delicate and sensitive problems of the family relationship to which this obviously may lead could be better expedited and differentiated from the commercial aspects. I understand the difficulties that we are all in, and to assist progress I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>NEGOTIATING SURROGACY ARRANGEMENTS ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 27, after " information ", insert
	<br><q><p>"relating to specific persons who may make or negotiate a surrogacy arrangement".</p></q>
Hon. Members may think that this amendment is unnecessarily underlining what is already implicit in the clause, but I am anxious about one aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that somebody writes a booklet or pamphlet, not in any sense to bring together two lots of people—the host mother and the commissioning parents—but to deal with the legal, social and general aspects of surrogacy, putting all the points and giving general advice. Books are written about abortion—about what one should do, about the kind of information that one should seek, the pros and cons, and the kind of counselling that one should get before one takes such a step, but they are written in a general way without relating to a particular instance, or to a family circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the wording of the clause mean that the author, the publisher or the distributor of such a book or pamphlet would be caught? If so, that would be going far too far. I am not sure that that is the intention of the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, on 15 April 1985, the Minister said that the Bill:—
	<br><q><p>"also prohibits bringing together information to enable someone to put couples in touch with one another."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 April 1985; Vol. 77; c.54]</p></q>
That seems quite clear, but I want to ensure that the many sociologists or medical experts who write treatises on this question—it is a new subject for everybody—will not be inadvertently caught if they give general advice and point out the pitfalls that may occur to surrogate mothers and commissioning parents. This should be done generally and not designed in any sense to try to bring the two parties together. That is why I have suggested inserting the words

In one respect this is a probing amendment, so I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Lady that it is not our intention to introduce a provision that will lead to the consequences to which she refers. I am grateful to her for tabling this amendment because we could make some improvement in this provision in any event, but not by using the form of words that the hon. Lady suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the amendment stands it could prevent the compilation of lists of other people, for example, professional people, who might have clients or patients for whom they were willing to give advice or to make or negotiate surrogacy arrangements without fees. As drafted, the amendment does not help in that respect and we should be careful about how far we go in this provision. I would like to reconsider the matter, having given the undertaking that I have given, and consider changing the provision in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for undertaking to do that. It shows that these things are worth exploring in Committee. The hon. Gentleman has given me another idea, which I had not thought of. Whichever way we can tighten this up, if we can make sure that innocent people who do a good service in discussing the subject are not caught I shall be satisfied. On that undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the issues that we are raising this morning fall into a context similar to that of the issue that we have just dealt with: it is a question of having a view about what should or should not be caught, while we are anxious about the area in between, which may impinge on both. This group of amendments spotlights that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that what we are anxious to avoid is the development of private practice that concentrates on these arrangements in ways that many of us may feel other provisions in this medical and moral legal area have done in the past, and that many of us were not happy to see develop. In other words,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
agencies and professionals move outside their general practice to pick up what they see as the financial and other benefits of being in this field as specialists. I suspect there may be agreement on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty arises when we try to define that. I suspect that amendment No. 9, in the name of the hon. Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson), tries to cover the point about what someone is paid for doing something as part of his normal practice. I can see that difficulty. On the other hand, that may open up the vast area of private practice, either legally or medically, which we would want to oppose. To try to avoid that being done, I prefer to take the risk, in amendment No. 7, of saying that it would not be regarded as being on a commercial basis to give virtually casual advice about surrogacy as part of one's medical practice. Therefore, it would be best to state specifically:
	<br><q><p>"No solicitor or other person shall on a commercial basis give general or legal advice or other counselling"</p></q>
in regard to surrogacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question whether I am reading it correctly, and whether it is a better way of doing things. I should be happy to hear the arguments on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Meadowcroft) is doing the opposite of what I am doing. He is tightening the provision up and making certain that nobody, in the course of his normal business and taking a fee in the normal way, could involve himself without being culpable. I am suggesting the reverse—that people who give advice in the course of their normal business and not as part of a commercial agency should not be culpable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that nobody in the House would want a commissioning couple or a possible surrogate mother to go without any advice at all. I accept that we all find the question of surrogacy rather difficult to cope with, because it is not a normal part of our lives. At the same time, we have accepted in the Bill, at least for the time being, the fact that surrogacy exists, and we want to see it outlawed on a commercial basis. Surely we do not want to close the door to conselling, to medical advice, or to the possibility of, for example, some kind of legal arrangement between the two parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all dream scenarios in which a woman could be exploited if she did not take some kind of legal advice about her situation. Provided that that advice was given by the solicitor, the medical practitioner, a social worker or whoever it might be, in the course of his or her normal job—I accept that solicitors make a charge; I do not say that they make profits out of this practice, but I am sure that they must make a living—it seems to me that it would be most unfair if they were caught by the Bill. In the Second Reading debate, the Minister for Health said:
	<br><q><p>" Any solicitor, professional person or anyone contemplating doing anything for a fee for the parties involved would have to study the Bill carefully before giving any such advice. The answer is to be found in clause 2(l)(a), (b) and (c)."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 April 1985; Vol. 77, col. 54.]</p></q>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
I have read it in conjunction with the clause and I am still not clear that a solicitor or a doctor—who is paid, after all—or a counsellor in a non-profit making organisation who was asked for advice and who was paid separately, but not for this specific act, would be caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Minister has cast doubts by saying that the person concerned—the solicitor or professional person—would have to study the Bill carefully. I appreciate that lawyers and doctors have to read legislation before they do many things, but I should be glad to know what the Minister's view is. Is it the Government's intention to prevent professional services being given by anyone who is paid separately when giving advice and help to the couple, or to the surrogate mother, or to all three?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite right in saying that the two amendments go in opposite directions, although both hon. Members have probed the Bill in a similar way. I hope that I can satisfy them that the Bill, which goes neatly between the two amendments, is about right, and catches the actions that we wish to catch without inhibiting people from carrying out their ordinary professional duties, or from giving valuable advice to people who need it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is that the acts that will be made criminal are defined in clause 2(1)(a), (b) and (c). Anybody—doctor, nurse, social worker or marriage guidance counsellor—who receives a payment for doing any of those things will be committing an offence. I shall loosely paraphrase the paragraphs. Paragraphs (a) and (b) run together. It would be illegal to take payment for negotiating a surrogacy arrangement acting on behalf of one or other party or both and taking any active part in the negotiations. Secondly, it would be an offence to receive payment for compiling information that is meant to lead the way to surrogacy arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, it would be an offence for a person to start receiving payment for compiling lists of people known to want to be surrogate mothers, or people who require a child by a surrogacy arrangement. Anybody, regardless of profession or occupation, doing any of the things defined there for payment will be committing a criminal offence under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that will be made illegal by the Bill. Any other advice or help given, whether on a commercial or non-commercial basis, will be all right. Dealing with the professions that we might have in mind, commissioning parents, for example, might want the advice of a doctor, psychiatrist, marriage guidance counsellor or social worker if they are seeking general advice about the wisdom or otherwise of surrogacy arrangements. As long as we keep voluntary surrogacy legal there is no reason why the people concerned should not give advice about the possible consequences if the commissioning parents were to take such a step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, a solicitor or lawyer may be consulted by people to learn what the law is on surrogacy once
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
the Bill is enacted. As amendment No. 7 stands— I am sure that this is inadvertent—it would mean that nobody, after we have passed the Bill, could say to a solicitor " I am thinking of paying my next-door neighbour to act as a surrogate mother. Has Parliament made this illegal? " If the solicitor gave advice and took a fee he would be committing an offence if the amendment were accepted, whereas one of the things that we are hoping when the Bill is enacted is that people will find out from their lawyers if necessary, what Parliament is making illegal. So I think that a solicitor will have to be allowed to take fees for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point—amendment No. 9 is not necessary, for the reasons that I have already given. So long as the advice that is being given is ordinary professional advice and does not amount to an act as described in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of clause 2(1), it is a perfectly lawful piece of advice to give, and a person cannot be committing an offence if he gives it. If a person goes to a solicitor he can be told that Parliament has made commercial surrogacy illegal, and the solicitor can explain exactly what that means. If a person goes to a marriage guidance counsellor, the counsellor can give that person his opinion on the likely effect on the marriage, or on the child. That is all perfectly legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think there is any need for the amendment. The moment either person says " If you want to go ahead, I'll sort it out, I'll draw up a contract, I'll act as the go-between in searching for somebody who can fix you up with the necessary arrangements ", whatever his profession he will contravene the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not altogether happy with the Minister's reply. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson) pointed out that counselling and advice was essential for those considering surrogacy as an option, and that that should not be precluded by anything in the Bill. The Minister acknowledged that in his speech on Second Reading, and said that the potential exploitation in such arrangements could apply to all three parties to the surrogacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was generally accepted on Second Reading that counselling was very important. The Minister, following the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking, said:
	<br><q><p>"It is arguable that if someone is giving general advice and counselling for a modest fee, they would not be committing a criminal offence."[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 April 1985; Vol. 77, col. 54.]</p></q>
The words "it is arguable" make the situation vague without an appropriate amendment. Amendment No. 9 is a good one, in that it enables non-profit-making organisations like the Family Planning Association, women's clinics and GPs to give the expert counselling that is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman help me by giving his view of the phrase "normal professional practice"? If a registered medical practitioner or a lawyer decided that it would become his normal professional practice to concentrate entirely on surrogacy arrangements, would not that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
leave it open for him to do what I suspect we do not i wish to let him do—to develop that kind of agency specifically for that purpose as opposed to being part and parcel of a general and more sensitive and sympathetic guidance as part of the medical practitioner's National Health Service work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking applies only if the work is a part of a person's whole practice. If a professional tried to make a living purely out of surrogacy advice, he would not make a very good living, particularly when the Bill becomes law. I think that those fears are unfounded. The non-profit-making organisations are recognised as responsible and they should be seen in the Bill as capable of giving proper counselling and advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I fear from the Minister's comments is that any surrogacy arrangement would be precluded under the National Health Service by the Minister's comment that it relates to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) if they then said that they could not give any advice on those particular aspects. If there were a surrogacy arrangement under the National Health Service, payment to the surrogate mother would not necessarily be ruled out, but under the clause people could not give that sort of counselling. There is a need for clarity, to enable counselling and advice to be given by the recognised and respectable bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms, Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said. I am not happy about what the Minister said. I accept his good intentions, and I am sure that he does not intend people to be caught unnecessarily, but subsection (l)(a) refers to
	<br><q><p>"initiate or take part in any negotiations".</p></q>
Let us forget about the initiation and talk about the taking part in the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a couple go to a solicitor with the surrogate mother-to-be and say " We have decided that we would like to come to this arrangement, but we need a legal agreement between us, and we do not have a clue what the law is." The solicitor tells them what the law is, and then they start to discuss the arrangements—what payment is to be made, what will happen to the child, whether there will be any clauses in the agreement that insist upon the child being handed over, and whether there will be a get-out clause if the mother changes her mind. Surely in the course of discussing with the three of them the arrangement that they want to come to, the solicitor is taking part in negotiations. That being the case, he could be caught, because the word " negotiations " is included in the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that if the solicitor called together Mr. and Mrs. Brown and said "You have been looking for a surrogate mother and I have found one", he would be culpable; that would be fine. It would be all right by me that he should be caught by the law. But if he is engaged in questions of divorce, conveyancing, and all sorts of other things for which he gets paid—I am not saying that he does not make a profit out of it; obviously he does—and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Mr. and Mrs. Brown and the potential surrogate mother say " We three would like to make this arrangement. The three of us have decided that we would like to get together, but we do need a legal agreement", he will have to help one group to negotiate with the other, and it seems to me that he could be caught by that. I should like to know what the Minister, who is looking thoughtful, thinks about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) also raised a valid point when he pointed out that I was cautious enough on Second Reading to say that it was arguable that giving general advice was not a criminal offence. Having reflected on that phrase, I can be more categorical. Having reconsidered the point, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that someone who is just giving general advice and counselling, of a legal or any other nature, cannot be guilty of an offence under the Bill. That is the main point that everybody is after, and one with which I wholly agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I am pressed to be more precise about exactly what actions constitute a criminal offence if payment is made I have to adhere to the wording of the Bill. The Committee is considering the definition that it wants of the acts that are to be made illegal, and there they are all set out. Therefore, what a solicitor will have to remind himself of, in the tricky case raised by the hon. Lady, as he is dealing with people who are plainly talking about the law on surrogacy, is that he must not initiate or take part in any negotiations.
	<br><q><p>"with a view to the making of a surrogacy arrangement".</p></q>
That is what paragraph (a) is about: it covers negotiations that are a preliminary to the making of the final agreement. The paragraph is worded in that way so that a person cannot later get out of it by saying " I was not involved in negotiating the actual agreement. I just negotiated the basis on which they came together."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (b) is more precise. It makes it illegal even to "offer" to negotiate the making of a surrogacy agreement and certainly to "agree" to do so. Therefore, if a person says " I can draw up a document for you ", that is illegal; and certainly to draw up such a document would be illegal. The arrangement would not have to be in a document. If an oral arrangement were negotiated it would still be illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, subject to whatever amendments are eventually made following the hon. Lady's last amendment, the compiling of information and taking payment for it would be illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would have to apply the language of the final Act of Parliament to whatever discussions took place in the circumstances described by the hon. Member. The sensible thing for a solicitor to do would be to say to the three people who have come to consult him about it that he could give clear advice about what is lawful and what is not, and what is enforceable and what is not, if any surrogacy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
arrangement is made. The moment Mr. Smith is asked to set it out on paper, telling them what they have to do and drawing up an agreement to say where the child is to be conceived and delivered, and at what stage the child shall be handed over, and it is proposed that he should take a fee for that, he will have to say " I cannot do that. That makes it illegal for me to assist you in that way ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we attempt to move away from that and give a wider, blanket protection to people in particular professions, we run the risk of weakening the Bill. If we had somebody who was making a profit— I accept what the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) said, that he would not be likely to make his sole living from it—and lets it be known that he is a useful man to go to negotiate a surrogacy arrangement, he would have a ready defence if he said that it was all part and parcel of his usual solicitor's practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that makes it as clear as possible. The result will be precise, because if ever a prosecution is brought before a court, the court will consider the wording of the Act of Parliament and say " This is what Parliament made illegal". It will listen to the description by the parties of what went on, and if the solicitor's activities match the wording of the Act of Parliament he will be found guilty of the offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me get this right. Let us take the case of the solicitor, because that is the most tricky, as the Minister says. These three people come to see him and ask what is the law. He explains the law, and they understand. They then ask for a contract to be drawn up between them. They ask for " a piece of paper, so that we know where we are ". Can he draw up that piece of paper for them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So they are prohibited from having a document drawn up between them legally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see what the hon. Member is getting at. Three people consult a solicitor, and the first question they ask, let us say, is " Parliament has just passed the Surrogacy Arrangements Act. We are thinking of having a surrogacy arrangement; where do we stand?" The solicitor is perfectly entitled to give them a clear explanation of what would be legal and what would be illegal. Indeed, if they were acting entirely on a noncommercial basis he would probably tell them that it was perfectly legal and that they could go ahead as the Act stands, and he could take a fee for that, because they have sought his professional advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, when the solicitor has explained to them that what they are proposing to do as a perfectly voluntary arrangement is quite lawful, they then ask " Could you draw up an agreement or arrangement between us to make it clear on paper exactly what we each have to comply with?", if the solicitor wishes to do that it will be illegal for him to take payment for it. If a solicitor were to draw up such a contract and not take a fee I think that he would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
be all right, but the moment he draws it up and receives a payment for having done that, it would be illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people were to consult a solicitor and say " We have already negotiated this agreement between ourselves "—they may be three not very literate people, and they may tell him " We have just had a chat, and we have sorted out X, Y and Z "—he may tell them " That sounds perfectly legal to me ". They may say " We are not very good at setting these things out. To make sure that everybody understands it, can you draw up a document setting out our negotiated agreement"? If I may add a further complication, I think that he would be all right doing that; he could charge a fee for putting it into acceptable language, because he would not have taken part in the negotiations. The matter would have come to him only when the negotiations were over. That also meets the hon. Gentleman's point. Persons who had already negotiated an arrangement might be half-way through it, and might be getting into a terrible mess. If they had already entered into an arrangement they could go to a marriage guidance counsellor, a psychiatrist or a social worker and say: " Help us, we need your advice; we negotiated this arrangement and now we think that it has all gone wrong ". Anybody could charge a fee for sorting it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the arrangement becomes commercial, in the definition of the Bill, if a fee is taken for drawing up an agreement? If the three people say: " We do not want any money whatever to change hands between us; we just want to know where we stand legally with regard to the child ", that is not commercial, as I understand it, within the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It comes back to what I was trying to say at the beginning, about the definition of the word " commercial". As I understand the definition to which the Minister drew my attention earlier, " a commercial arrangement" means an arrangement whereby money changes hands. It seems odd to me that if a lawyer is endeavouring to assist a noncommercial surrogacy it becomes commercial by his drawing up of an agreement. That seems to be the import of what the Minister is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important thing is to be absolutely clear about what it is that we are seeking to make illegal. The acts that we are seeking to make illegal are, first, receiving payment. If anybody does anything for which he does not receive payment—other than advertising; we are leaving aside the advertising provisions for the moment— we are not dealing with that in the Bill. Anybody who does anything for nothing need not be concerned about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that somebody wishes to receive a fee—that is likely to be a professional person who finds himself dealing with one of these cases in the course of his ordinary business, as has been described. He commits an offence only if he receives payment for a particular act. If he receives payment for proscribed acts under the Bill he is guilty of the offence. A solicitor commits an offence only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
if he takes a payment for a forbidden act under the terms of the Bill. The forbidden acts are the three set out in paragraph (a) (b) and (c). If the solicitor takes money for doing any one of those things, that is illegal. If he takes money for doing anything else, it is not illegal under the Bill. Those are the only offences that he can commit. So long as he does not take any payment for doing anything that falls within the descriptions in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c), he—or she—is all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am proposing to withdraw the amendment. I want to think about it again and to read what the Minister said, because the matter is extremely complicated. I am not very happy, because I think that many couples need help. The Minister said that three people could decide that they wanted to have an arrangement, and to check what the law was. A lawyer could tell them what the law was, and he could get a fee for that. Then they could say: " We have this arrangement. These are the terms of the arrangement, and we would like you to put it on paper for us ". As long as the lawyer does not open his mouth, but just puts the arrangement into legal language, it is all right for him to receive payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us say that the couple are patently exploiting the surrogate mother and the lawyer sees this clearly, does the Minister really mean that he has to sit there and not say a word; that he must not point out to her that she is getting a really bad deal? Could he not say " I think that you should go to another solicitor "? It is something of a minefield, I must admit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I should like to read what we have all said and try to get it clearer in my mind. Perhaps we could seek to have something clearer put into the Bill on Report, because the result of what the Minister has said will be that no solicitor will touch anything of this nature at all. Solicitors will keep away from it altogether, rather than involve themselves, almost unwittingly. I know that they have paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in the Bill at which to look, but that in itself includes the word " negotiate ", which is difficult to define. It will be virtually impossible for agreements to be properly laid out between the parties concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is is clear, as the hon. Lady says, that substandard amendments in this group are defective in attaining what we seek to attain. I hope that it will be possible to look again at the question of finding some way of amending the Bill to permit legal advice to be given. I am convinced by the Minister that we should not accept amendment No. 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the matter further, it would seem to me wrong to inhibit legal advice being given which would not lead to a surrogacy arrangement, which would be otherwise illegal—in other words, that the legal advice is to attain an object that is not otherwise made illegal by the Act. If it is possible to consider that definition during the process of the Bill it would be beneficial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon. Members, in thinking about it further, will think about exactly what we are trying to make illegal. We have all agreed that we shall not make illegal anything that a surrogate mother does so far as she is concerned. We shall not make illegal anything that commissioning parents do, so far as they are concerned. They are absolutely free to negotiate what we have all called a voluntary agreement between themselves and to carry it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree, at the same time, that we wish to stop commercial agencies taking any part in this process and that agencies can be bodies of people or one person. I cannot see what it is we think they are doing that is offensive, if it is not what we are talking about; negotiating arrangements between these people, bringing them together, setting up the arrangement, and taking money for it.

If one starts to give wider and wider exemptions for what the agents do, one will wind up by making nothing illegal at all. That is obviously not the hon. Member's intention, but if one wishes to soften the impact of the Bill here or to clarify that certain people can do things that are not illegal, we run the danger of eroding the Bill to such an extent that hardly anybody will be able to commit a criminal offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger in prolonging this complex discussion. If there is an arrangement that will not be illegal under other clauses, and the three people involved simply want to entrench on paper arrangements that they have themselves come to, or to which they wish to come— they may not involve a commercial status, but simply the status of the people concerned and of the child—it would be wrong to make their situation worse by inhibiting their being given that kind of legal advice. I hope that the Minister will accept that it is possible to define that without undermining other provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments are concerned with the question of the burden of proof. I feel myself in a minefield here, because I am not a lawyer and I am not good about deciding how to try to put the burden of proof on the prosecution. I accept well in advance that probably what I have done may not necessarily achieve the effect that I wish. I had always thought that the burden of proof ought to be on the prosecution and not on the defendant. I am not a lawyer and not normally involved in legal cases, so I am not experienced in such matters. I had always thought, however, that that was a general principle of our legal system— that the burden of proof fell on the prosecution and that it was not up to the defendant to prove innocence so much as for the prosecution to prove guilt. It seems to me, and, apparently, to some lawyers, that as the Bill is drafted the burden of proof is on the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defendant must prove that he did not know that a payment had been made, or that the body of which he was a member was engaged in providing surrogacy arrangements. I should have thought that the police would investigate such things first, where they are suspicious. People are being asked to put themselves at risk by being obliged to prove their innocence in this matter. I want to know how this provision will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I ask the Minister to explain it to me, I want to put another point to him. I should have thought that on such an important issue as this, where the burden of proof is reversed, there would be considerable trouble in another place. I have from time to time heard their Lordships talking very learnedly about the burden of proof being on the prosecution and not on the defendant. Unless the Minister gives us a satisfactory explanation, I should not be surprised if their Lordships did not have one or two things to say about this reversal of our normal legal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say what their Lordships might do when they reach this part of the Bill, but there are precedents for a provision of this kind in other parts of the criminal law, where a specific defence is made available to someone accused of a criminal offence. The law provides that, while that defence is available to him, at least a certain burden of proof is put upon him to raise it. But perhaps that is not the right way to start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm to the hon. Lady that it is the underlying principle of the law, including the Bill, that the burden of proof in a criminal offence lies upon the prosecution. It is quite a heavy burden of proof; no one could be convicted of any criminal offence in our courts unless the tribunal were satisfied—beyond all reasonable doubt, as most people say— that there was no reasonable, sensible doubt about the case being made against the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can, however, be difficult for the prosecution to prove a negative. There are some defences that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Parliament may wish to provide for certain offences where it is reasonable to say that the person should at least set the defence up and give some evidence that, if not rebutted, will prove that defence. In such a case the burden on the defendant is never as heavy as that on the prosecution to prove the offence as a whole. The defendant is under the obligation only to raise the probability that he had the particular defence that is set out in the law provided by the statute. The main burden in the case still lies on the prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a defendant gives evidence and raises the probability that he is innocent, no conviction will result unless the prosecution can disprove that, and satisfy the person hearing the case that there can be no sensible doubt that the full offence is made out, which means that the defence is disproved and does not run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one final attempt to make clear what I am saying. Let us take the case set out in subsection (4)(c), where a person's defence is: " When I did this, I did not know that any payment had been received by my firm ", or whatever it was. "I thought that we were doing it voluntarily. I did not know that we were being paid for it." That is fine if he gives evidence that confirms that. If nobody contradicts it, presumably he will be acquitted. But it is up to him, in the first place, to raise it and say " All right, a payment was made, but I did not know that a payment was being made ". If he raises it, the prosecution will have to challenge it, rebut it and knock it down, and satisfy whoever is hearing the case that it is not true and that the main offence is made out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult if the amendments were made and it became necessary for the prosecution to prove that without evidence. There might be a case where the prosecution made out the full case and showed that a payment had been made, but the defendant did not call any evidence, merely submitting that there was no case to answer, because, although the prosecution had proved that a payment was made it had not proved that it was known that a payment had been made. It might be said by the defendant: "For all you know, it is possible that though the payment was received, before I did what I did, I did what I did without knowing that payment had been made."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an unreasonable burden to put on the prosecution, and for that reason the Bill is phrased as it is. The hon. Member frowns. I may not have made the matter clear. I have done my best in trying to think of examples, off the cuff, as a rusty practitioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples in statue law where similar defences are provided. My off-the-cuff recollections will probably be proved scandalously wrong by somebody who has a chance to read them. At one stage there was a similar provision in the breathalyser law, where a defence that was open to a driver was to demonstrate that he was not likely to drive the vehicle again during the time when he was over the limit. That is where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Somebody is found "plastered"—to put it in colloquial and non-legal language—but says "All right, I was over the limit, and the car was there, but I was not going to drive until I had sobered up".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"That is the defence that the defendant has to raise, and he has to establish that. Once he has raised it, the burden of proof rests with the prosecution to disprove it and to satisfy the court that the offence was committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that it was not so much worried frowns that we showed as having to decide to say " Pass " or to endeavour to answer. It is rather like " Mastermind ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I take up the Minister's analogy, it concerns the problem that a defence against the breathalyser law is for the defendant to say that he was unaware that he might be over the limit because someone else put things in his drink. That has not been held to be a defence, as I understand it. The law was very strict about what its purpose was—to stop people, knowingly or otherwise, driving after a certain amount of drink. I do not think that it is a fair analogy to draw with this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the problem with the Bill is that we are not sure what the scale is, or might be, of people endeavouring to undertake surrogacy arrangements. It has all been shrouded in understandable mystery in the past, with few exceptions, and we do not know whether there may be a commercial gain to be made in the future. If gain is to be made, we are aware that there will always be people around to exploit that commercial possibility, and one tries to achieve a " worst case " Bill to deal with that potentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, I am not sure whether the Minister is correct. If there is such an easy defence as to say " I was unaware of that", I am not entirely sure that it will fit the case. On the one hand, one ought not to say that there will not be much of this because it is not a particularly attractive possibility for people who want a child. There is repugnance on some people's part, understandably: others see it as being difficult to organise. On the other hand, the Minister asks for this rather draconian provision put this way round rather than the way it is put by the hon. Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson). I am unsure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister believes that more people may want to exploit this than he thought earlier, I understand why he has put it in the wording that he has. I am not sure that his analogy is accurate, and why the burden of proof should be as he has explained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure I understand what the Minister said. That is my fault, for not understanding how the law works. I would not want the defendant not to be able to say, for example, that he had or had not received money. My temptation is to withdraw the group of amendments, which I assume to be defective, and to think again when I have had a further look at what the Minister said and perhaps take further advice about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister will respond to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Meadow-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
croft), but I would like a little more time to think and I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment and perhaps return to the subject on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneh Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will take some more time to think about it, just to make sure that we are not unnecessarily raising problems in the Bill, though obviously—as I hope I made clear—I do not think we are. I re-emphasise that the prosecution would have to prove the essential ingredients of the offence as they are set out here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prosecution would have to satisfy the criminal burden of proof that is referred to, that— if we may take a defence under paragraph (a)— somebody took part in negotiations of a surrogacy agreement, and then turn to subsection (3)(a), just to make clear what " commercial basis" means, that he received, or somebody else received, a payment in respect of his having taken part in negotiating a surrogacy agreement. That is a criminal offence. So long as the prosecution was able to demonstrate that the person took part in the negotiations, that a payment was made, and that the payment was made for the part he played in the negoiations, it would be a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any of these other special defences are required to be raised it is up to the defendant to raise them when he gives evidence. Presumably he would have to give evidence and say whatever it was that he wished to comply with. In that case the prosecution would have to knock down his defence again. Only if the court were left, at the end, satisfied that the prosecution had rebutted any of these defences would the defendant be convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the offences do seem to be a bit tautologous. It seems to me that the prosecution would have to prove that the payment made was in respect of the negotiations, so I would like to consider further why we should necessarily set out in subsection (6) that it is a defence to prove that the payment was not made in respect of the arrangement mentioned. It may be that some point lies behind that which at this instant of time escapes me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will go though all these points and consider them again, and I have no doubt that their Lordships will have a go at it if they remain dissatisfied with the drafting, or the laws that it comprises. At the moment I do not think any of these amendments would necessarily help; indeed, I think that they would definitely be unhelpful, because they put positively on to the prosecution the burden of proving a whole lot of negatives, which I think in many cases a prosecution would find it impossible to prove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This may be redundant. The clause provides that if the person is acting on behalf of a body of persons it is all right. My amendment is re-emphasising that

Point. Let us suppose that the employee of a nonprofit-making agency broke the law without intent, in a counselling session. In having a counselling session he was being paid by the agency. The agency pays for the counselling generally. What happens? I think that I have overlarded the cake. I think that I may be adding words unnecessarily, but I want to be certain that the person who is doing the counselling could not be called in the way that it seems to me he might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is overlarding, to use her own phrase. In clause 1(7), in which a " body of persons " is defined in the first instance, it would not be the usual practice for any organisation thus defined to specify that a person connected with it should receive specific payments. That would be odd, as normally when payments are received no discrimination is made between types of payments, or who receives the payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that when the hon. Lady's constituency party receives donations she does not mind from which source they come. I do not mind in my own area, whether they are from my street collectors or from one of my officers. I am pleased that they come to the party through any set of hands. It is hard to see why, in defining the circumstances in which an offence under the Bill is created by a body receiving payments from surrogate mothers, commissioning parents or people connected with them, it should be necessary to specify that the person receiving the money was specially authorised in some way, which would be the effect of the hon. Lady's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that anybody would wish to give a special authority when the only result would be to make illegal payments which otherwise would be entirely legal. I do not think that the hon. Lady's amendment achieves anything to that effect. The offence under subsection (5) can be committed only by the body of persons defined in clause 1(7), and not by the individual who receives the payment. On that undertaking, I hope that the hon. Lady will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the advice of my right hon. and learned Friend on one issue. We have not made non-commercial surrogacy illegal in the clause. It will therefore be permissible for voluntary agencies, such as local authorities, charities, or health authorities, to procure a surrogacy. I believe that the Warnock recommendations would have been rather better than the provisions in the Bill, and I regret that we did not go further than we have done in this clause. There is a substantial loophole that could be exploited by the unscrupulous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
If a commercial agency in the United States, which was itself outside the scope of our legislation, were to advertise and to receive payments, but do no more than put would-be parents in touch with a non-commercial agency in this country, our intentions could still be frustrated. The illegal act would not be taking place in this country; it would be taking place in a country where such an act was not illegal. The activities of the charity or other body in this country that were of themselves non-commercial would remain unaffected by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister said that he will consider this matter again when we consider Warnock, but it seems to me that we are not going far enough, and we certainly would not, in the Bill, be ending that potential abuse. I should be grateful for my right hon. and learned Friend's advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to reply off the cuff, but my hon. Friend is right in describing what he considers to be a loophole. I am not sure how effective a loophole it would be in practice. The first and most obvious point that I can make is one that my hon. Friend clearly already appreciates. The Bill does not cover anything that is done outside the United Kingdom, so that if the items set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are not carried out in the United Kingdom, and the negotiations, too, are carried out abroad, it seems to me that that would be a complete defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if the acts in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are committed in this country but some payment has been made abroad, before the acts were carried out, I would need to consider whether that circumstance would be caught by the provisions of the Bill. It might, if one found one's way through the tortuous details in subsections (4) and (5) and applied them to the situation that my hon. Friend is describing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly anybody who does any of the acts described here on a non-commercial basis, without receiving any payment—and without any reference to payment being made before he did the act, with the intention of facilitating it—would, I think, be entirely in the clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will consider the point raised by my hon. Friend in more detail and if, when I read his speech, I think that I have misunderstood the point, or not given a wholly accurate reply, I will write to him and make the matter clear. He is certainly right in saying that the difficulties that arise here have led to some uncertainty and vagueness. The only thing that we have caught for sure is the payment of money in respect of illegal acts in this country. There are quite a number of other variations that we have not at this stage made illegal and that will have to await more detailed consideration in a later Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My first reaction to the questions is that the Bill makes it clear that certain acts are illegal and if they are committed in the United Kingdom but not if they are committed abroad. I do not think it matters where the payment for those acts is made, so one could not pay in America for an act done in this country and get away with it.

It has struck me that " however expressed " is an odd phrase to use, and I really do not know what it means. I am advised that " expressed or implied " is more explicit and clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "however expressed" seems to imply that people should realise what others may read into their advertisement. Why should we not be more precise about this? Some people may remember the old contraceptive advertisements, when they were illegal. I am old enough to remember that. [Interruption.] You and I, Mr. Leadbitter, are old enough to remember the time before they became legal. It was very difficult for people looking at those advertisements, who did not want contraceptive advice, to know what they were about. They depended upon certain key words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What were they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not remember, but there were certain key words. I am not a reader of Lonely Hearts columns, but I understand that such columns have advertisements for people who want to get together, and that contain key words that indicate to the person who reads them whether the advertiser is homosexual, heterosexual, or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the key words are very specific if one knows what one is looking for, but not if one does not—if one is reading the advertisements simply because, one is standing at a bus stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
whether he agrees with me that " expressed or implied " is a better version to put in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Lady down every path that she opened up. I have always thought that athletic disciplinarian ladies were trampoline experts, and I shall continue in that belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's change of wording is clear, but it is different from that in the Bill and would make the provisions about advertising even more severe than they are, although I do not think that that is her intention. As the Bill stands, the advertisements that will be illegal are those that indicate the matters set out subsection (1)(a) and (by. The words in brackets to which the amendment refers make it clear that the exact words do not have to be used. It does not matter how one describes it; so long as the advertisement amounts to offering a surrogacy arrangements it is illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, if somebody argued—I do not suppose anybody would—that his advertisement was not illegal because the language that he used was not " I am or may be willing to enter into surrogacy arrangement". If the meaning is the same, however the person has expressed it, the advertisement is illegal. That is why the Bill is in the way that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's amendment would mean that if the advertisement contained these indications expressly—using whatever language—or even implied these arangements, it would be illegal. That would indeed lead people proof-reading, and publishers trying to protect themselves, down exactly the avenues that the hon. Lady is now sure exist, as I and many people are: one would have to pick up implications that one thought would be recognised by those being advertised to and say " We must not carry that. It is not a legal advertisement."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to accept the hon. Lady's amendment, the prohibition would be made much more sweeping and a broader range of advertisements would be covered, but newspapers and publishers would find it much more onerous if they had to pick up implications of that kind before deciding whether they were carrying a criminal advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going on to later matters, I know that the hon. Lady thinks that we are being somewhat too severe on publishers and proprietors now, so she cannot have both amendments alongside each other. An argument could be made for her amendment if one wished to make the provision much more severe than it is. I had the impression that that was not her intention, and probably not the wish of the majority of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am a little bothered about this. I shall try to explain it clearly. The clause makes it illegal to advertise that someone is willing to participate in something which, according to clause 2(2), it is not illegal to do. It is not illegal to do what is in clause 2, yet it is illegal to advertise. Again I am exploring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that there is a genuine case of a woman advertising that she would like to be a surrogate mother and does not want any payment for it, likes pregnancies, and would like to offer her body to provide a child for another couple but does not want any recompense for it. There may be many women who would want to do that; I do not know. It is possible. I understand that her advertisement would be caught, even though what she was doing was not illegal. I think that is going a bit far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that my amendment is absolutely correct. I realise that it would be difficult for an editor to have to decide. Let us suppose that somebody who was not arranging for a surrogacy commercially advertised the matter. How would the editor know? It is strange that it is illegal to advertise although the person concerned may not be behaving illegally in what she is offering to do. What does the Minister have to say about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points—one of principle and one of practice. The one of practice the hon. Lady has alluded to already. She is right in her description of this subsection. Practicality takes us back to what those items in advertisements in Lonely Hearts columns mean, because a lady may wish to advertise her services out of the goodness of her heart to help infertile couples have a child, or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be exceptionally difficult for anyone accepting an advertisement in the first instance to know whether that advertisement contained certain key or buzz words to indicate that a commercial proposition was being advertised. Back we go to the enjoyable browsing that I do every week, through the Lonely Hearts columns—it is important sometimes to admit to one's recreation habits—of the New Statesman and the Spectator. The New Statesman for a long time has had an excellent Lonely Hearts column, which, believing in knowing the enemy and his and her habits more clearly, I have long looked at. I have noticed recently that the Spectator, too, has started a Lonely Hearts column. This points to entirely different sorts of habits among Conservatives, compared with Labour and Left of Centre supporters and advertisers in the New Statesman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have to come clean to the Committee; I have never placed an advertisement of that kind at any stage, but I hope that those people who do find them useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told earlier by the hon. Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson) that there were certain key words and buzz words, and that if someone knew what to look for he could meet a person who could help him to achieve his particular ends. I shall look again this weekend, when I compare the New Statesman and Spectator, to see whether there are terminological and semantic differences in the words that are used, and let my imagination run riot to see whether political interests are reflected in social interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practical difficulties are extreme in accepting the hon. Lady's amendment, for reasons that I have tried to outline. The important point is that of principle, because of the effect of the way in which the hon. Lady's amendment is drawn although of course, amendments can be withdrawn and changed later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three areas in which the advertising provisions of the Bill would be loosened very considerably. First, the amendment as drafted would still allow an intending surrogate mother to advertise her services for gain to all comers. I know that that is not the hon. Lady's intention, but that is what the amendment, as drafted, would allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would allow intending commissioning parents to advertise the offer of large rewards for surrogacy. Again, I am sure that that is not the hon. Lady's intention, but as drafted I am advised that that would be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, and not least, it would leave it open to agencies to draft advertisements that the person resorting to them could himself place with impunity. In other words, the agency could draft an advertisement and say, " Pop this in the paper as an individual ", and that would allow yet another loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could try to redraft the hon. Lady's amendment to avoid those three loopholes. I recognise that, but I do not think that on this occasion we could be so obliging to the hon. Lady as we have been on several other occasions this morning. We are not just being obliging; we are grateful to her for some of the probing amendments that she has tabled, which may allow us to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend and I take the view that in this Bill it is an important part of meeting the objective of preventing commercial surrogacy to prevent any advertising of surrogacy of any kind at all. We think that it is the thin end of the wedge, potentially. For me anyway, and for my right hon. and learned Friend, advertising is the first step towards commercial activity. The opportunity is there for loopholes to occur, of which agencies could make use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thin end of the wedge argument, alas, means that the amendment—the reasons for which I appreciate—could not be improved in such a way as to allow us to draw a line and to say that we did not wish to step over it. We did not wish to permit any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
advertising because if we did we feared that loopholes would always be there and that this might encourage people on the downhill path towards commercial activity. It is a matter of judgment, but my right hon. and learned Friend and I must advise the Committee that, alas, we cannot agree to consider the hon. Ladys' point further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we are in the crystal ball area as to the scale of the difficulties. If I believed, as the Minister apparently does, that there might be a significant number of people trying to place advertisements, some of which might well be the thin end of the wedge towards commercialisation, I would be more sympathetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me pose the problem that it might be a family situation, where a woman offers to bear a child for a relative, or even a close friend. It seems to me wrong to make it difficult or well-nigh impossible to have a surrogacy if one does not have close friends or relatives who might be prepared to undertake it. If one is banning all kinds of advertisements that might lead to someone assisting I should have thought one's judgment might be—almost by definition of what is involved—that there is hardly likely to be more than a few women prepared to undergo surrogacy without some kind of recompense if they did not know the people involved. I doubt whether a significant number of people will be involved in advertising in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least I must give the Minister some credit for consistency. In some respects what is being dealt with by the amendment is not dissimilar from what we were dealing with earlier in relation to lawyers, who currently are caught by doing an illegal act towards a legal act. I should have thought that it might be worth considering again—in the same way as we looked at the possibility of lawyers being able to follow a course of conduct that would not lead to an illegal act—whether it was possible to define a way of permitting advertisements to be placed that would not lead to an illegal act and yet would not cause the problems of investigation and enforcement mentioned by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all things that we might predict that would result from such a Bill, one of the least likely is that there will be a rash of advertisements for people offering themselves for surrogacy on a non-commercial basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend feel that it would be possible to include in the Bill something to prevent direct mail contact, which is becoming increasingly common in this country? A non-commercial agency in this country, or a foreign agency, might well direct mail to people inviting them to take part in surrogacy. That does not seem to be caught under the clause. I should be grateful for my hon. Friend's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being consistent in raising interesting and difficult points this morning. We congratulate him on that. I am advised that the question of direct mail is covered by subsection (5). Whether it would catch direct mail from abroad—a point that my hon. Friend raised
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
with my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister on an earlier matter, and that my right hon. and learned Friend has agreed to consider further—is something that we shall have to investigate at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It seems to me, however, that it would have to be proved that the direct mail constituted an advertisement. Whether an invitation by mail constitutes an advertisement is perhaps debatable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my feeling that the word "advertisement" would be interpreted as covering any form of attempt to induce someone or to make available a series of services connected with surrogacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the problems that my amendment might cause. I had not thought of the effect of the suggestion that I trailed in the previous amendment, about buzz words in respect of this amendment, but I can see that that might happen. I see that it might be difficult for editors, or for those who look at advertisements, to decide what was a commercial arrangement and what was not, but I am a little bothered about all the provisions on advertisements, which seem to me to be extremely tough. We shall probably have to wait to see how it works out before we make judgment about it. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 4, line 28, leave out from "Kingdom" to "is" in line 29, and insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment follows on from amendment No. 21, and is simply another attempt to solve the dilemma that an editor or publisher could be in if he did not know that the person placing the advertisement was a commercial agency or a woman or couple seeking a non-commercial arrangement. As I said earlier, normally the backs of editors and publishers are pretty broad, and they can usually cope very well with the situations they find themselves in. I am not normally in the business of defending them, and they certainly have not asked me to do so. At the same time, it would not be fair if they were caught unwittingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will tell me how the system works, as I do not know. If editors or publishers receive an advertisement about which they are doubtful, do they quiz the person submitting it? Do they call him in and ask him what his intention is? How do they decide what is an advertisement that might be suspect under the law? Do their lawyers simply
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
make a decision based on their interpretation of the advertisement? One sees advertisements on television about how one can advertise in newspapers. For example, to place an advertisement in the Standard one is told to ring up such-and-such a number and place the advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage a fleet of people who take advertisements over the telephone taking an advertisement without realising what it was about. Might not they be culpable as well? It is difficult. The Minister may say that it does not work like that, but I am not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I want to sell my car I can ring up the Standard and place an advertisement, which will appear on the following day, or perhaps even on the same day. If I put in an advertisement that did not make it absolutely clear that I was a surrogate mother, or a commissioning parent, how would the person taking the advertisement know? What sort of system will the newspapers evolve to deal with this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bruinvels 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reassure the hon. Lady, having worked in the newspaper industry? It is quite right that one may phone in an advertisement that one wishes to have inserted, but the newspaper reserves the right to accept or publish any advertisement. In the unlikely event of their actually publishing such an advertisement there is always a disclaimer published at the same time. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may satisfy me, but would it satisfy the Minister, or the law? What the hon. Gentleman said is extremely interesting. If the clerk at the end of the telephone accepted the advertisement and let it go through, and then there was a disclaimer, which said that the editor was absolved from culpability about it, would that get him off the hook? I should not have thought so, under the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meadowcroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put a point before the Minister responds. As I understand the law relating to the publishing of libellous material, newspapers are in rather a different position from members of the public, in that malice has to be proved. It seems to me very draconian to suggest that the publisher of an advertisement should be liable, regardless of whether he is aware of what he is publishing or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to pursue that point, as to whether the Standard is liable in the case mentioned by the hon. Lady, or whether something would have to be proved against the person placing the advertisement in the first place, or the person writing or providing the material for the story. It seems a shame that we cannot assist those who might unwittingly publish, who would appear to be culpable and liable under the Bill whether or not they were aware of the content of the buzz word that the Minister and the hon. Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson) appear to' know so much about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may revert to my hon. Friend's answer on subsection (5) to my question on direct mail, even if one accepts what he says regarding an advertisement by direct mail being covered by the provisions—about which I still have reservations—it seems to me that the person committing the offence would then be the Post Office, if it knew it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the best thing that I can do is to give an explanation of what I think the Bill does and what the position of newspaper editors and proprietors is. An advertisement is illegal if it contains the indications set out in subsection (1). Subsection (2) provides that if the newspaper or periodical contains such an illegal advertisement the proprietor, eidtor or publisher is guilty of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only question that newspaper proprietors have to ask themselves is "Does the paper contain an illegal advertisement?" In reading an advertisement and in scratching his head about it he does not know what the advertiser intended, or what would be found to lie behind it if somebody were to ring up to find out what the person at the end of the phone meant. All that the editor will have to ask himself is " Does this advertisement contain an indication of the kind that the law proscribes?" If he reads the words and they express that indication in some way or another, it is an illegal advertisement, and he is guilty of an offence if his newspaper goes out containing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady thinks that that is too severe, and suggests three amendments, making two broad points within them. The first amendment, provides that the proprietor, editor or publisher should not be guilty of an offence; only the person who inserted the advertisement should be guilty. That would absolve the proprietors from any liability towards things that people have put into their small ads columns, or into their major advertising material. That would make the whole thing extremely ineffective, because the editor could publish without any penalty for his newspaper, which would let the newspaper off the hook. The person who puts in the advertisement might knowingly incur the penalty or fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may draw an analogy with the barrow boys, with whom we are all familiar who are always being prosecuted for causing obstructions or breaking by-laws, we all know that some street traders take the fines as part of the costs of the business, and accept that they will have to pay fines every now and again. It is conceivable that somebody would place an illegal advertisement and be prepared to pay a modest fine to have the advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more effective to say that the newspaper, its editor or proprietor, should be guilty of an offence, because we know that newspapers will not wish to take such a cheery view and will take positive steps to protect themselves. The step that they will undoubtedly take is to check and proof-read their advertisements and to have somebody who will spot that they have an illegal advertisement and remove it to avoid the obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
The second broad amendment proposed by the hon. Lady is that the editor and publishers should be guilty of an offence only if they knew that the advertisement contained the proscribed indication. That would give those involved in the newspaper or periodical a defence if they simply did not check it or simply said, to take the strictest view of what the hon. Member said, that they did not read the advertisement. It would be difficult to show that they knew it was there. It would be much better to leave the law as it is, so that the newspaper is placed under a strict obligation to protect itself, and it is not good enough for it to say "We did not spot that". Newspapers have to protect themselves, and if it turns out that they let one illegal advertisement through they are liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar rule applies in libel. I do not want to go into the rules on defamation any more than I am drawn into them, but it is no defence to a newspaper, if it prints a defamatory statement, to say " We did not know it was there," or. " We did not know it was defamatory". Otherwise, many newspaper editors would have the classic defence of " I thought it was true " and would print defamatory statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, to take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) about direct mailing or distributing leaflets, we are not dealing with people in charge of newspapers or periodicals who, because they are in the business, are expected to protect themselves against the risks that publication entail. Someone would be guilty of an offence of distributing advertisements of that kind only if he knew that they contained the kind of indication mentioned. Someone who was asked to deliver envelopes door-to-door in a locality who did not know that what they contained was a handout for the services of a surrogate mother would not be guilty of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having explained what I belive the Bill means, and having referred to the amendments, I hope that I have given sufficient indication why I think the Bill is probably preferable in the form in which it stands, without amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for explaining my amendments, which, in my enthusiasm to listen to the words of the newspaper tycoon—the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Bruinvels)—about his experience, I forgot to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments were probing. It has been a useful debate, about how advertisements are placed and the responsibilities that are placed upon editors. I only hope that if the Bill becomes law with this clause unamended editors and publishers will read the debate to see what they will have to do. It might not be clear to them until it is drawn to their attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. It is an attempt to get clear the question of jury trial, which bothers me very much. I raised this matter on Second Reading. In his reply, the Minister for Health said:
	<br><q><p>"I am sure that the subject of jury trial will be raised in Committee."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 April 1985; Vol. 77, c. 54.]</p></q>
He was then interrupted by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and did not return to the point. I do not know whether he was relieved not to have to deal with it and was readily diverted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little worried, because I could not think how to frame an amendment that would meet my objections and at the same time not increase the penalty. I could have put forward an amendment that increased the penalty to six months, which would have meant that my points would not have been covered, but I am not in the business of doing that. I think that three months is right.. So I have deleted the reference to imprisonment altogether, in order to get a debate about it to see whether the Department can indicate whether or not we could not get round it in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be a problem. The jury option is available, as of right, to anyone who is convicted and sentenced to six months or more. On an issue like this, which could involve all sorts of people, including people with distinguished reputations, a magistrates' court seems not quite the place to deal with it, I should have thought that a proper trial with a proper jury would have been much more suitable for such a case, if ever one comes to court, than to dealing with it in a magistrate's court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Magistrates are extremely worthy people, but I should have thought that they were hardly the best professional people in a tricky situation like this, where we have spent all the morning being not quite sure what the law means, or how it should be phrased. I could not think of any other amendment—other than taking out imprisonment altogether, which I do not particularly wish to do—in order to produce an acceptable amendment and to get some kind of a debate about it. I hope that the Minister will give me some indication of his feelings

	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking, Mr. Leadbitter, for the avoidance of doubt, to intervene in the hon. Lady's speech and not to pre-empt your role at this stage in our proceedings. The answer is " No ", under the present law, unfortunately for the hon. Lady and for the point that she wishes to achieve. I am pleased that she feels that we should continue to have a penalty of imprisonment. That is important. It would not normally be imposed, except in the most reprehensible cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow my right hon. and learned Friend's analogy, in being a dutiful junior Minister—I commonly follow his analogies and lead in these matters.—just as the barrow boy or barrow person could discount forward the possibility of fines as part of his or her trading profits, so an agency could decide to discount forward risks like this and make financial provision for fines and pay people for having to serve a term of imprisonment. I hope that we have the support of the Committee in our wish that imprisonment should be kept as a provision in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim has to be to try to stop the carrying on of a trade that we all regard as objectionable, and not simply to add to its running costs. There I exactly echo what my right hon. and learned Friend said in an earlier debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of trial by jury the answer is " No ". I do not share the hon. Lady's views about the magistrates, and about the Bench. I know that she was not denigrating their ability, but there are straightforward practical issues of proof here. Those are the sorts of issues that can be dealt with by a magistrates' court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have considerable problems with a queue of people waiting for jury trials, with people on remand for substantial periods. We do not wish to add anything to that long list, or to those people waiting for such long times, by adding one whit to the provisions that could bring about jury trials. There is great pressure on the courts. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will be the first to say that there are considerable difficulties in this sphere, with hundreds of people seeking jury trials. It is not a practical possibility, and I greatly regret that the Bill in its present form is a better version than that which the hon. Lady seeks to substitute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that my amendment does no more than raise the matter. I assure the Committee that in no way am I denigrating the role of the magistrates' courts and the Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the magistrates' court is not the most suitable place. I can envisage a situation in which a case coming before the court might involve a number of people—the doctor, the parents, the profit-making people, the social workers, all sorts of people. For something that may be quite a large trial a magistrates' court is not necessarily the most suitable place. Lacking my being able to find some other way than increasing the sentence to six months, which I do not want, I cannot think of any way round it. I shall take further advice.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have come quite neatly towards the end of the morning and the end of the agenda. I have thought this on many occasions since I have been in Parliament, and I think it again: I sometimes wish that I were a lawyer. Sometimes I am glad that I am not, because a non-lawyer's mind is often a good one to apply to the framing of legislation for ordinary people, but in this case I wish that I were a lawyer, because I understand that questions of neglect and crime are frequently debated by lawyers, and that the whole question of neglect is very contentious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, criminal acts are usually not committed as a result of neglect but for other reasons. For example, what would happen if an officer of a body concerned with counselling, who might otherwise be caught by the Bill or who ought to know about the Bill, were away on holiday, or were ill, and was therefore not responsible for what was done in his absence? Could he not still be indicted for neglecting his duties? Would it not be hard to prove that the neglect did not take place in his absence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the officer concerned failed to instruct a new employee of the detail of identifying or refusing a surrogacy arrangement. Let us go back to the lawyer or solicitor. Let us suppose that a couple and the surrogate mother came into a lawyer's office to discuss the matter with him, and he was at court. They might see his clerk, or perhaps even his secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that other hon. Members will have had the same experience as I have. One sometimes rings up a constituent's solicitor and is put through to the solicitor's secretary, who knows very well about the case and will tell one what the situation is, once he knows who is ringing. That person may give the wrong advice or involve himself in something which is not his responsibility, but he does so only because his employer or senior officer has failed and has neglected to give him the right information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would that make that person criminal? That seems to be taking things a little far. I am very hesitant about the whole question of criminal neglect, which I find very difficult to understand, but to bring the question of neglect into surrogacy, as we do in the Bill, adds to the minefield that we have trodden through this morning.

negligence. Manslaughter is the most spectacular example that leaps to my mind. In regard to the narrower point, one can answer most of the specific examples that the hon. Lady gave of the circumstances that might trouble her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a start, we are talking about a body corporate, which would not include a partnership of solicitors or individuals. This part of the Bill follows the common form that is used in the drafting of pieces of legislation where it is intended, first, that the body corporate—let us take a limited liability company— might be guilty of a criminal offence, but also, in certain circumstances, where people who work for that body corporate might also be personally guilty of a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many circumstances in which that is sensible, particularly in the case of a little business, which a commercial surrogacy agency might be. The company probably comprises two or three people anyway, and it would be quite wrong if only the company could be guilty of a criminal offence and the directors were not personally liable to any penalties. Apart from anything else, it would make imprisonment an ineffective penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precedents have been followed by the draftsmen to make it clear that where the offence is committed by the body corporate, if the people listed have consented to it or connived at it they are personally guilty of a criminal offence as well. In circumstances in which they have neglected part of their responsibilities and—this is an important aspect of the words that the hon. Lady wishes to delete— the offence is attributable to that neglect, a senior person in the company can be liable for the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were to be as generous as the hon. Lady's amendment suggests and leave out the question of neglect even where the offence is attributable to it, the danger would be that it would lend a ready defence to people in senior positions in companies. They could say "Well, I was only involved in the negotiations. I do not know whether we were paid for it or not." The director may say that he did not know that the person paid the cashier. It would be wrong for him to escape penalty by simply neglecting his responsibilities to make sure the company was acting lawfully, and that no one collected money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we do not want to encourage people to turn a blind eye to what is clearly their responsibility within the company, it is right to keep this form of wording, which has not caused too much difficulty or been challenged recently when it has been applied in other branches of commercial and criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made the matter much clearer to me, and I am grateful to him for his explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruinvels</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support everything that my right hon. and learned Friend said. If this amendment were pushed to a vote and, heaven help us, passed, it would be damaging to the Bill. The body corporate, as it is constituted, has a great responsibility. Taking out the words " or to be attributable to any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
neglect" would mean that neglect would bring about an offence. I want to see that in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have too many problems already with the American side, where there may be this kind of offence with no prosecutions taking place. It is very important that the amendment should be withdrawn, if only to protect those people. We cannot have directors saying, " It was not our fault. We were hot there that day; it was our day off". For that reason I very much object to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost tempted to say that the pleasure that I had in agreeing with the Minister has somewhat evaporated because of the intensity and passion with which his hon. Friend sought to ensure that we retained the wording. However, I accept that it is the body corporate. I know so little about the criminal law and how it operates that I readily accept that there are areas where the question of neglect is a crucial one.

All the amendments tabled this morning have been designed to ensure that people who are innocent, or who behave in an innocent way, are not caught by a Bill covering a subject new to us. One of the interesting things about this morning is the few times that we have all looked at our notes and the many times that we have been reading the Bill as we have been discussing it, which seldom happens on Bills with which we are more familiar and which are more formal.

I hope that this morning's proceedings, when we read them, will result in a Report Stage that brings forward one or two changes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

You certainly added to our speedy progress, and with your easy and informal manner you added to the good atmosphere. We are all extremely grateful to you.

If you have the misfortune to become the Chairman of the Committee that considers the full War-nock Bill, the discussions may be an altogether different proposition, because of the nature of the controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my thanks. Mr. Lead-bitter, you have been a charming Chairman, so much so that I thought that you were part of the Committee at one stage, and expected you to intervene, because you seemed to be so interested—which is not always the case with every chairman. Thank you very much indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
