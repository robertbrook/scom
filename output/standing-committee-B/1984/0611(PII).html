	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just prior to the dinner break I was briefly trying to illustrate some of the aspects of the clause. I shall not take an excessive amount of the Committee's time but I had simply covered the point that related to the difference between the ways in which investors had to be legitimately concerned about the risks involved as opposed to the tax treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I moved on from that to say that there were three different layers of participants in this market and the clause really only focused on one, the investor. I was about to ask the fundamental question about the character of taxation and the specific gains or losses made by the investor, as opposed to others who come under a system of taxes. Most of the revenue from that area comes under case I, in a trading sense, of schedule D as opposed to the case VI treatment of the investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that hon. Members on both sides of the Committe will have read with interest the DTI's White Paper on investment where it sought to embrace within that category financial and commodity futures. It is an historical anomaly that they are not taxed in that way. All we are seeking to do, not simply for the obvious competitive advantages of London, is to correct that anomalous taxation treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members asked about the nature of the costs. I was as clear as I could be and it might be of help to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) if I tried to illustrate why. At the moment we are not dealing with the vast bulk of taxable income from this area, which will not be changed because it is the case I dealers and traders income which will be tested by the revenue on the basis of whether it is a trade. That is expected to continue on the same basis of taxation. It is only for an investor where he is not regarded by the Revenue as being involved in a trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is to analyse the amounts of revenue that come under case VI, schedule D, because that is not broken down. We should look at the income tax yield under case VI and I can help the Committee by illustrating the quantum. The total estimated case VI yield is about £50 million which embraces far more than this particular area. It is reckoned that something in excess of £30 million comes to this income from property, and so we are already in the case VI area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am trying to make is that the present anomalous historical taxation system has deterred investors from participating and giving greater efficiency and liquidity to these markets. Similar major
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
commodity markets overseas receive the capital gains tax treatment in the United States, which is the main area of competition, and we are seeking to put that in the clause for investors. That is similar to what the hon. Gentleman would call an advantageous tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the extent that it has deterred investors from participating, the presumption—it can be no more, and the hon. Lady legitimately made the point earlier—is that although the rate may be equitable in the judgment of the Government, the right rate for that transaction—capital gains as opposed to an income tax rate—is likely to generate more investor activity. In consequence, even with a lower rate, it is likely—it is hard to be precise—to increase rather than decrease the yield. But that is not the intent. The intent is not to seek a greater yield; it is to make sure that the tax treatment is right and is a proper tax treatment for this particular character of transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, who is a decent member of the Committee and listens when his attention is drawn to such matters because it may be an area with which he is not familiar, should reflect on his remarks about what he called the casino-type operations of commodity futures exchanges because they are an important part of our market places which greatly benefit industry and trade. I remind him, so that he may reflect on the facts - at his leisure, that the size and success of our commodity futures markets—which in the clause we seek to increase—make a major contribution to the United Kingdom's invisible earnings. He may not be aware that in 1982 they were the fifth largest contributor to our invisible earnings, at £215 million, which was more than that of the stock exchange. They are not an insignificant part of the British financial community. In 1983, they contributed £350 million to our invisible earnings. These figures come from the Committee on Invisible Exports. I shall not go into all the market functions, because, as I have already said, I do not want to delay the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to be precise on estimates, because the industry has a hard core which is actively involved in many of the dealing functions, and there are many ancillaries. It is suggested that the hard core of those involved directly is 5,000, and up to 15,000 indirectly in supporting and related functions. So about 20,000 people are involved in an activity that not only is of great benefit to the efficient running of the markets but also produces revenues for the country, taxable profits and employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has been happening to the contribution to our invisible balance of trade? Has there been a general increase in the contribution made by this area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The overall pattern of invisibles has been rising. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the relativity of the rise within the commodity futures. The key issues is the much greater rise in terms of volume of transactions and trade of the competitor commodity markets, where there is a different form of taxation, especially in the United States and Hong Kong. We are second to that of the United States. That is where the competition lies, and the rise there has been much greater. So our proportion of the way in which our markets add to our invisible earnings is less than it might otherwise be. However, I shall not labour the
<span class="label imageref" title="Sc1984-1985V002P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
point. I wanted to put on record the significant contribution that this area makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) talked about the nature of the impact of exchange rate instabilities. With exchange rate instabilities, interest rate instability and the dominant role of multinational companies in trade, corporate executives feel that there is a need to hedge the basic risk. The conclusions that I draw are precisely the reverse of those that the hon. Lady drew. If there is added instability, one should try to help the efficient running of markets by ensuring that the risks can be hedged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the basic points that were raised. This is a modest measure and has a significant bearing on the activities of a successful feature of modern Britain which employs a lot of Britons. I hope that the Committee will welcome the way in which we are correcting this historical anomaly in our taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I want to make one or two further points. I accept that commodities and financial futures markets are a part of the economy. No one denies that, but the initial argument was that if we change the tax regime it will enable these markets to expand and compete better, particularly with the American markets in London and New York. They are already extremely successful markets. One has recently been added to their number—the London international financial futures exchange. These markets seem to flourish at any rate, and the Minister seemed to add support to that view. The justification that seemed to be given at an earlier stage—that one had to change the tax regime to encourage their expansion—does not necessarily hold true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point can be made by way of comparison. The Minister said that the change applied to investors. At present, under the case VI rule, an American investor resident in America who invests in one of the London futures markets, can pay case VI taxation in London. Under the new rules he will not be liable to pay that tax because he is not resident in this country. The Minister may argue that that will encourage American investment here and so enable the market to expand and possibly to increase tax revenues. On the other hand, that has to be set against the loss from the case VI taxation on that investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the difference does not apply to the UK investor investing in the London or the Chicago markets. If he is resident in the United Kingdom he will pay either case VI tax or capital gains tax here. The only way that he can avoid paying tax under either regime is if he does not declare income or capital gains made on investments abroad. That may be difficult for the Inland Revenue to detect, but the investor would deliberately have to make a false declaration or fail to declare money gained abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that it is not correct to say that it is anomalous that futures are taxed as case VI. They are not long-term investments but short-term quasi-trading operations and for the investor they are relatively short-term investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, reference has been made to LWH Holdings. Whether or not that company is being investigated for fraud is not relevant, and in that sense the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was correct. The point extracted from the circular sent out by that firm was
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
that the changes in the tax regime were being presented as a good deal for would-be investors because the capital gains tax regime meant that an investor can gain £5,000 of profits free of tax. That does not happen under case VI taxation because only the normal personal allowances can be set against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change of regime therefore requires special justification. Opposition Members cannot see any reason why investors should have £5,900 tax free as opposed to the normal personal allowance, especially when one bears in mind that that figure is a little more than half the average male earnings on which, as earned income, a person is entitled only to the personal allowance. The case should be very strongly argued if the tax regime is to be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the Opposition's argument, and that is why I used examples from the prospectus of LWH Holdings. It gives a good example of the type of person about whom we are talking, even though we do not know whether the details are true, particularly in view of the current investigation. In referring to the man who dealt in coffee, the prospectus says that he was a man who could afford to lose £2,600 on one deal. That is not the sort of remark that most people who slog away for 40 or more hours a week, possibly in a routine and dull job, appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary is looking at his watch. Our work in the Committee and other such duties means that we may do more than 40 hours a week, but we get paid rather more than the average male earnings for so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider that someone can afford to chuck away £2,500, and can get £5,900 tax free in a particular year, the Government will have to argue the case very hard indeed for changing the regime. I do not think that the Minister has made a sufficiently strong case. He talked about the costs of the revenue gain from the current tax regime applying to future dealings being about £20 million a year. I think that the Financial Secretary said £50 million, and then—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was simply trying to illustrate the rough parameters of the whole of case VI. I accept that it may be somewhere within the £20 million, but clearly the outside limit is within the £50 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Financial Secretary spoke about £50 million overall from case VI—about £30 million derived from property, leaving roughly £20 million. I accept that those are rough and ready figures. Nevertheless, whether we are talking about spending £5 million, £10 million or £15 million, I am sure that my hon. Friends will share my doubts over whether we should be spending such sums on investors speculating in futures in this way, however responsible and important some of the investment may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a strong case for justifying a change in the regime, and as the Minister has failed to produce a strong enough case, we intend to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause 68 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 69</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEEMED SUMS AND RELIEFS ON TRANSFERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Ian Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say a few words at the beginning of this clause stand part debate, since it is the first clause in chapter IV of the Bill which deals with the the accrued income scheme? That scheme is set out in clauses 69 to 73 and schedules 19 and 20. It embodies a simple concept, which is, unfortunately, difficult, technical and complicated to put into legislation. The concept is that whereas before the introduction of the scheme a person would be charged to income tax on interest actually received in respect of securities while he held them, after the scheme is in force a person will be charged to income tax on the interest that accrues in respect of those securities on a day-to-day basis during the period of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the scheme is that in practice in recent years an increasing number of holders of fixed-interest securities—particularly gilt-edged securities— have sold their investments at a time when the price included a significant element of accrued interest. The advantages to the taxpayer of taking that course have been that the sale price gives rise to a charge not to income tax but to possible capital gains tax. In the case of fixed-interest securities, particularly gilts, it gives rise to no capital gains tax if the gilts have been held for more than one year, because such securities are exempt. Within one year such securities would give rise to a charge to capital gains tax, but only at the capital gains tax rate of 30 per cent which is equivalent to the basic rate and not to the higher rates. of income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence is that the Revenue has been losing a considerable amount of tax which would have been collected if the accured income scheme had been in force. There is nothing intrinsically immoral about the sale of securities under existing legislation. In fact, it has been difficult, under the old regime to sell securites without selling some accrued income with them, as that is how their price is quoted. Virtually every disposal except a few which in timing are closley related to the payment of dividends gives rise to some form of bond washing, whether deliberate or not being dependent upon the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears to the Government to be right to deal with increasing exploitation of this opportunity, which was
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
at a cost to the Revenue, and that is why we have introduced the scheme. It is complicated in detail, but the concept is simple: of the interest that accrues on a fixed-interest stock between one dividend date and the next, that part which falls within the ownershop of the vendor is to be charged as income to him, and that which falls within the period of ownership of the purchaser will be charged to the income of the purchaser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of amendments to schedule 20, and I shall not say anything in detail until we reach that schedule. I shall merely assure hon. Members that none of those amendments involve any change of policy or objective. They are merely designed to make the scheme work more efficiently, largely because of the complexity of relating the accrued-income scheme to the existing provisions for income tax and capital gains tax. Accrued income as defined in the scheme is not technically income. If it were ordinary income it would automatically fall within the normal provisions for income tax. But because it is deemed to be income, special provisions are needed for a range of technical circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. MacDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition welcome these provisions, because of course we want to see an end to a practice which costs the Revenue as much as tax avoidance does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bond-washing, as it is known, means the conversion of income arising on fixed-interest securities into capital form by sale of such securities prior to an interest date so that it can be chargeable to capital gains tax and not to income tax. The Government plan to introduce the full regime on 28 February 1986 and to have interim provisions for the rest of this financial year. The provisions will apply to all fixed and variable rate stocks and bonds, both British and foreign, issued by Governments, companies, local authorities and other institutions—I shall not refer now to the list of exceptions in clause 71.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abuse consisted of selling securities with accrued interest so that that interest formed part of the price received from the purchaser. It then follows that the payment in respect of interest can be taxed as capital gain rather than income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government already had some anti-avoidance legislation in place expressed in section 30 of the Taxes Act 1970. That legislation, however, was found to be defective because it did not apply to a one-off transaction. It applied only to those who repeatedly "washed bonds". It did not charge the basic tax rate, but only tax at the difference between the individual's top rate and the basic rate. That loophole was established in a High court decision in 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been other difficulties. I understand that the local district tax officers who deal with this type of bond have not always spotted tax avoidance measures. I am not sure that they will be greatly helped by the new provisions, in view of their complexity, but presumably the advice will help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary said that a good deal of revenue had been lost. He was, however, a little coy about the figure involved. The Inland Revenue press release of 28 February 1985 refers to a cost of £300 million in the last financial year. That is an enormous cost. Bearing in mind references that have already been made, that kind of money would have gone a long way towards settling the teachers' pay dispute or dealing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
with the problems of nurses' pay. The sum of £300 million was an awful lot to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we appreciate that the practice of bond-washing has been going on for a long time. But the point that the Opposition must bear in mind is that the attractions of bond-washing have grown considerably since 1979 for the following reasons. First, there has been a gradual decline in the severity of the capital gains tax regime. Secondly, there have been large increases in the personal capital gains tax allowances. From 1980 onwards, there has been increased use of the capital gains tax exemption by unit and investment trusts. There was the 1984 extension of the 12-month holding exemption of Government securities to corporate bonds, and in 1985 there was full indexation, the end of the 12-month limit and the creation of indexed losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of those reasons arising from the Government's changes in the capital gains tax regime have made the practice of bond-washing even more attractive over recent years than it was before.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Oh, yes. With respect I know what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is saying from a sedentary position: that is the Inland Revenue's assessment of the reasons for the increased attraction of this. There are a few other reasons which I can also mention and which are not directly the Government's responsibility. First, there is increased awareness by institutions about how to make use of the various rules applying in the case of bond-washing. The firm of Barlow and Clowes specialise in bond-washing, with a large portfolio of £400 million. It is the firm which the Inland Revenue has found particularly interesting and to which it tends to refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, many companies threaten to issue 13-month bonds which would automatically avoid tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The government are not directly responsible for the increased activities by such companies, but the attractiveness of bond-washing has followed from the changes in capital taxation which the Government have made since 1979. Frankly, they ought to have been far more aware of the costs of changing the regime in such a way that attractive and expensive—from the Government's point of view—tax avoidance measures were put into practice by companies active in this area. The Government have a responsibility. I concede that they are doing the right thing now in trying to introduce a much stricter regime; we have to check the details of that to see that it will operate in the way that the Government hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government have come to the Committee with indications that the practice of bond-washing was growing apace. They have not mentioned the figure but have said that it has been rather expensive in terms of revenue losses: £300 million is a lot of money to lose down the drain in a single financial year. It is money which the Opposition know full well could and should have been put to far better uses.

Even with all the changes to the capital gains tax regime during the past six years, surely bond washing must have been much more attractive when the top rate of income tax on investment income was 98 per cent., compared with 60 per cent. today. I thought that the hon. Lady was rather defensive. I suppose that she was trying to explain why, during five years of Labour Government, nothing happened on this issue. I cannot understand why she went on at such length on this issue, which is not at the centre of the debate, unless she was trying to make a party political point.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I thought that the hon. Lady was being defensive and that we should accept that the clause is now in the Bill. We should welcome it because, as the hon. Lady says, a considerable amount of revenue is at stake, and move on to examine the details of its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise the matter of how the provisions will affect members of Lloyd's. I am not a member of Lloyd's so I have no interest here. I have no connection with Lloyd's but it wrote to me and I saw it last week, at its request, for discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lloyd's claims that the provisions will apply retrospectively to its members. That way in which Lloyd's members account is a little complicated. They have a three-year period of account. The recent bad news for some members of Lloyd's about large losses arises from the 1982 year of account, which has only just been closed off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause comes into effect on 28 February 1986 and will apply to Lloyd's members in the calendar year 1986. The income accruing to Lloyd's members in that year is applied to three years of account 1986, 1985 and 1984. For reasons that I can explain to the Committee if necessary, most of the income is applied to 1984. There is no dispute about those arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The calendar year 1984 is used to calculate the income tax liability of Lloyd's members for 1984–85. Most of us, if we comply reasonably quickly with the law of the land, should by now have completed our tax returns for 1983–84 but it is not possible for a member of Lloyd's to have closed off his tax returns for any year after 1980–81. He is just closing off his 1982–83 year of accounts with Lloyd's. His 1983–84 1984–85 accounts are open with the Inland Revenue. We are looking a long way back. The 1984 calendar year is used for the 1984–85 tax year for members of Lloyd's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lloyd's has written to every member of the Committee so I shall not bore hon. Members by reading out more than one paragraph of its letter, which sums up Lloyd's case. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Lloyd's view … is that if a member of Lloyd's is taxed for 1984-85 year of assessment under legislation introduced in 1985 and implemented in 1986 he is being subjected to retrospective taxation. This is so for all members, but is, perhaps, most starkly exemplified by the Name who died in 1984 but who would be taxed under legislation introduced and implemented after his death."</p></blockquote>
I have examined the history of the way in which the House has approached the question of retrospection in the context of taxation legislation. The last major debate on the subject that I have identified was on 12 July 1978 on the 1978 Finance Bill, when the Labour
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
Government were busy introducing retrospective measures on commodity schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right honourable Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury set out what came to be known as the Rees rules. There are four rules:
	<br><blockquote><p>"First, warning must have been given to the taxpayer of the intention to legislate in this way and the warning must have been precise in form."</p></blockquote>
That condition was met by the Inland Revenue announcement of 28 February 1985.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Second, the problem at which the warning has been directed should immediately be referred to what is known as the tax reform committee for consideration—that is the committee that meets between the professions and the Inland Revenue."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether that occurred in this case.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Third, if the committee can devise an appropriate legislative provision the draft clauses should be published immediately so as to give a second clear intimation to those who are likely to be affected."</p></blockquote>
In this case, I think that the time that elapsed between 28 February and publication of the Bill was so short that it is not really relevant, because the fourth rule is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, such a clause must without fail be introduced in the following Finance Bill. "—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 July 1978; Vol. 953, c. 1641.] </p></blockquote>
That requirement clearly has been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say that those four rules have been met, but as my right honourable and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), now the Foreign Secretary, pointed out then, what had become known as the Rees rules were actually based on precedents going back much further, and he cited two of them. The first was contained in a speech by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe in 1949, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I put this principle forward as quite unchallengeable: that the justification for retroactive legislation is that a reasonable and definite warning has been given to people likely to practise the matter to be struck at, and they have been given the opportunity to avoid that course." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 April 1949; Vol. 464, c.499.]</p></blockquote>
The important point is that people should have been given the opportunity to avoid that course. Similarwords were spoken during the passage of the 1958Finance Bill by Mr. Heathcoat-Amory, then Chancellorof the Exchequer, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my opinion, one essential pre-requisite, if retrospective legislation is to be used, is that those concerned should have every reason to be aware of the taxation consequences of their specific actions and, therefore, have a chance of avoiding it if they wish".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 June 1958; Vol. 589, c.l132.]</p></blockquote>
I am not clear whether or not members of Lloyd's will have had an opportunity of avoiding the tax. Although they knew on 28 February that the tax was to be imposed, in their case it was to be taken back to their 1984-85 tax return, so does my hon. Friend feel that there is an element of retrospection in this in so far as it affects Lloyd's members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make one or two short observations, partly to do with the letter from Lloyd's, which I think every Committee member has seen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I unreservedly welcome the set of clauses before us. Interest payable at periodic or even non-periodic intervals on gilts and other securities clearly should be treated as revenue and taxed. That is preferable to the position until now, whereby a judicious sale of securities enables the holders to make capital gains which, at least for many people, are largely exempted, with the result that much of the revenue that should be collected by the Treasury is not collected at all. I understand that the figure at present escaping the Revenue is of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
order of —£300 million a year. That is a lot of money. It could do many things which Labour Members would dearly like to see done and which are not being done now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is wrong that people—no matter who they are—can change the rules by judicious selling and buying of gilts and other interest-bearing securities, thereby paying a far lower rate of tax. Therefore, I unreservedly welcome the clauses and, while I do not say that I have read them and schedule 20 in detail at my first or even second glance, I think that they are good provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These practices have probably grown up over the past few years; and I suppose that the markets and investors do not always appreciate the snowballing effect of an idea that catches on, with the result that sooner or later—usually sooner, and the sooner the better—the Treasury must take action because it realises that a loophole exists and that money is rapidly disappearing from its purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Lloyd's letter, I shall say nothing about retrospection, I have some sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). If someone is trying to order his financial affairs properly—not trying to evade tax to avoid it, which is quite legal—it comes hard on him if, say, after a year's time, the Government say, "Sorry. The taxation policy was to be such and such, but we are about to change it for the previous three years. So, although you may have based your management and investment decisions on a certain premise, we will make the change and there is nothing that you can do. you will have to pay more tax." I have sympathy with people in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that sympathy goes only as far as a body is responsible in managing its investment and financial affairs. Most members in Lloyd's behave like that. My sympathy would not extend to, say, fly-by-night organisations or those on the border of financial probity which are also on the border or of evading tax as opposed to avoiding it. I do not think that that applies to Lloyd's members. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lloyd's has a point in the second part of the letter in which it mentions administrative costs. Surely there is a system within the Inland Revenue which would avoid the employment of a couple of dozen accountants, tax inspectors and tax collectors, which could operate between the Treasury and Lloyd's to simplify the collecting of tax. If Lloyd's is correct, it will contribute between a quarter and a fifth towards savings estimated at £300 million a year, which is a great deal of money. It ought to be treated as a special case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four million people are unemployed, so if we could employ a few more tax collectors—which we need to do for other reasons—to try to sort out Lloyd's affairs on the basis of the clauses, it would be a good thing. On the other hand, there must be better ways of running the country. If the Treasury can find a way of simplifying collection, I feel sure that it would be doing the right thing. I am interested in hearing what the Minister says about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to points raised by hon. Members. I will not go into a deep
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
historical analysis of the way in which bond washing has grown year by year, or which Administration was in power in the relevant period, because it would be a fruitless exercise. My reason for saying that is that the great growth of bond washing which has caused the Government these specific anxieties and led to our acting this year has been by institutions, not by individuals, so it is not the treatment of capital gains tax or income tax which has led to the build-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was right to say that under a Labour Administration, with very high rates of maximum tax on personal investment income, there would have been an enormous incentive to use the bond washing technique. But because of the increased sophistication of the institutions that have used this method, we have been able to calculate that significant sums have been lost in the past couple of years as a result of the exploitation. I am not trying to conceal or play down the figure, The fact that it was in the original information published by the Government proves that. I did not touch on facts and figures in my opening remarks. I merely wanted to give the Committee an introduction to the way in which the measure worked. I am glad that it has been welcomed by the Opposition side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements are inevitably technical because although the concept is simple, the application of what is, in effect, a proxy for income, but not income which is taxable under income tax, has to be fitted in with the other rules relating to income tax or tax on other forms of money which accrue if a person is not subject directly to the income tax regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) raised the question of Lloyd's. I note what the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said about having sympathy for responsible bodies which traded in that way. If a significant part of the £300 million comes from Lloyd's, it means that much of the tax which, under a neutral scheme such as the accrued income scheme, should have come to the Revenue, has not come to the Revenue as a result of the activities of Lloyd's syndicates. I do not complain about that; they were using the rules which applied at the time, just like every other citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of retrospection is confused by the Lloyd's three-year accounting system. We will not impose retrospective taxation on events that have not happened. None of the events which will give rise to the new change can take place before 1986. We have allowed a year of transition, recognising that to balance the interests of existing and future holders of investments there should be a period during which the scheme can be properly established and the market can adapt its quotations in order to be able to use it. An interval should be allowed, and 12 months seems appropriate. In order to avoid excessive use of the bond washing technique in the interim period we have introduced forestalling provisions. Those are included in clause 72 and schedule 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot convince myself—and I do not think that I should be able to convince the Committee—that an event which does not take place until next year and giving rise to tax can be retrospective. The application of the three-year rule to Lloyd's is designed not for that purpose, but to balance the income against the claims
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
of the funds. It is helpful to Lloyd's to run its account in that way, and I do not quarrel with that because it is perfectly reasonable. Insurance is not something which chops up into single annual periods like other forms of trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ordinary incomes and claims are apportioned back in the third year to the first and the second, but that is not to say that future tax regimes should be apportioned back automatically to previous years for Lloyd's alone. My hon. Friend mentioned the case of someone who died—a deceased Lloyd's name. Under the Lloyd's system, the personal representatives—normally the executors—of a deceased name are locked in to their outstanding liabilities and the matching investment in their premium trust funds until the years which are left open at the date of death are closed off. They receive, and have to bear tax on, the interest and capital gains which arise on those investments after the death of the individual Lloyd's name, and equally they should bear tax under the accrued income scheme or, indeed, any other tax regime which applies during that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logical consequence of saying that because Lloyd's operates on a three-year basis it should have a further period of delay in the introduction of the scheme would, in effect, be to say that if a tax loophole is to be closed, or if measures of this kind are to be taken to prevent exploitation, in the case of Lloyd's they would always have to be delayed for two years because some of the change of regime would work back to two years previously. It would not be equitable to other taxpayers to say that, if we want to make a change in the tax system which will apply to all future taxable events, Lloyd's should be excluded merely because, for its trading purposes, it has a three-year apportionment of income against its claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I cannot accept the point made by my hon. Friend that there is retrospection in the ordinary sense in which it is generally discussed in relation to tax matters. I have examined the matter most carefully and discussed it with representatives of Lloyd's because, on the face of it, there is an anomalous position. However, the anomaly arises from the three-year accounting method, not from the proposals that we are introducing. No one will be taxed under the accrued income scheme until next year. I do not believe that it can be claimed that with that amount of notice it involves either any breach of the normal rules of retrospection, the so called Rees rules, or those of general equity. Therefore, I cannot offer my hon. Friend any encouragement on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administrative compliance of Lloyd's is an important point. It was mentioned in the letter, and the hon. Member for Wrexham drew attention to that. The Revenue is in discussion with Lloyd's about the operation of the scheme, because the way in which Lloyd's underwriting is conducted is an unusual form of activity. If there are ways in which the scheme can be either adapted or adjusted so as to make it more easily manageable in respect of Lloyd's, we are happy to try to find agreement on that. I wrote to the deputy chairman of Lloyd's some time ago to invite the firm to consider this matter, and I met him more recently. I hope that those discussions will meet the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the general introduction of the scheme, I believe that it is understood that it is a necessary change. We have been careful to try to lay it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
out in such a way that it is comprehensible, although it is technical and complex, and operable in a workable way once it comes in. Clearly, the tax offices which will deal with it will have to master it, and I have no doubt that they will get all sorts of excellent guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by reminding the Committee that the greater part of the circumstances which gave rise to bond washing arose in the corporate sector. Therefore, there are not enormous numbers of individual stockholders who have given rise to the loss of revenue. The bulk of it has been through the corporate sector, in which, no doubt, sophisticated people are involved in dealing with those matters on both the, Revenue and the company side. I believe that it will prove workable in practice. Once people get used to it, it should be perfectly straightforward. One difficulty in contemplating that at present is that the stocks concerned are not yet quoted in the same form as short gilts. Short-dated gilts have been quoted for many years on the basis of a capital value plus accrued income. I do not know exactly how the market will decide to produce its information in future, but if it were to follow a similar system, the complications and the ability of the taxpayer to deal with it would be greatly eased.

What would happen if an interest payment date occurred shortly before the end of the year of assessment or accounting period and there was a delay in banking a cheque for interest, so that it was assessable in the following year or period?

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the nineteenth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 2 contains the basic charging rules. The notes on clauses makes it clear that under subparagraph (1), no charges will be made on the person unless he has been served by the Inland Revenue with a notice requiring him to supply particulars of his transactions in the year to 27 February 1986. How will the schedule operate and on whom will the Inland Revenue serve such a notice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transitional provisions in paragraph 4 seem to reduce or eliminate a charge which would otherwise under paragraph 2 apply to an individual or his company based upon his bond washing activities. If his previous three years' bond washing income, which is what E effectively amounts to, exceeds D, which is the level of accrued income in 1985-86 calculated under paragraph (2), there is no approved income charge. Even if E is less than D, the paragraph 2 charge is reduced by the amount of E. Why should the previous bond washing be rewarded, as it will be under paragraph 4?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point also relates to paragraph 4. The transitional provisions protect disposals made before 27 February 1986, because the Government did not wish to act retrospectively, but they also seem to protect purchases after 28 February 1985. Thus, a bond washer with scope for protection in paragraph 4 is being encouraged, if he is not already up to his limits, to go out with a final fling and buy further securities to bond wash with one six-month interest payment. I should be interested to hear the Minister's view on this matter and whether further amendments should be added to exclude the seemingly generous treatment of bond washers under paragraph 4 of schedule 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has asked me questions about the details of paragraphs 2 and 4 of schedule 19, which, as the Committee will know from the notes on clauses, is the technical anti-forestalling part of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
There are several provisions in the schedule which will limit the application of the charge in the coming transitional year. We considered that a transitional period was necessary before the introduction of the full scheme so that those who had planned their financial affairs with a view to what they would be doing during the coming months need not change instantaneously, as a result of the announcement on 28 February this year, the way in which they were conducting their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions include a measure which takes any investor out of the charge in the transitional period if the accrued income during the period is not more than 110 per cent of the actual income received in the period. The reason for having a margin between the accrued interest and the actual interest is that, for someone actively bond washing, the accrued interest would exceed the actual interest received by a substantially greater figure than 110 per cent. That is the first of the main provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) referred to the three-year calculation—the second main provision, which allows a period of adjustment for those who have been actively buying and selling gilt-edged stock, so that during the transitional year they can continue that activity up to the level at which they have done so before, but they cannot increase it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such forestalling provisions were not put into the legislation, there would be a temptation in the last year to bond wash everything in sight, which would be expensive to the Revenue and contrary to the Government's intention and would frustrate the whole scheme for several years. Clearly, the new regime could not be applied instantaneously after an announcement—on 29 February in a leap year or on 1 March, as in this year. We considered it right to make transitional provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the provisions in the Bill will cover the problem mentioned by the hon. Member for Thur rock. We aim to hold the level of the activity at roughly its present position until the new provisions are fully in play. In appropriate cases, the Inspector of Taxes will require taxpayers to supply particulars of their dealings. Since in many cases the charge will not apply, it is appropriate that the Inspector of Taxes can notify those whom he thinks are likely to be subject to charge so that they can produce the information and it can be tested against the provisions that I mentioned, and thus establish whether an actual charge is due.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 219 to 230.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 73 was passed without comment from Committee members. It is a succinct clause of two lines. I cannot say the same of schedule 20, which contains the great bulk of the general rules for the accrued income scheme and deals with a number of special situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Bill was published and the clauses have been available for consultation and consideration, a number of comments have been made. We have ourselves considered the clauses intensively to see whether there were other areas which needed specific provisions that had not been included in the Bill originally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 13 amendments to schedule 20. They are designed to secure the effectiveness of the accrued income scheme both generally and in a number of special situations, about which the Bill was not entirely clear, and some of which arise from the fact that accrued income is not technically income for income tax purposes, as I mentioned earlier. Appropriate provisions therefore have to be spelt out rather than assumed by transfer of the income tax provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of the amendments are drafting amendments either to get the meaning of provisions exactly right or to clarify obscure points. Government amendment No. 218, which I mentioned to the hon. Member for Thur rock (Dr. McDonald) earlier, is a drafting improvement which seeks to remove the ambiguity about the holding for husbands and wives. Other amendments which deal with drafting defects are Government amendments Nos. 224, 226 and 228. The other amendments seek to introduce new material into the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the amendments are highly technical. Government amendment No. 227, for example, deals with a disposal which is not a transfer. That is the sort of language which is beloved of tax experts, but is perhaps not readily understood by every Committee member at first glance, so perhaps I might comment on it. The amendment covers the consequences for capital gains tax of disposals which are occasions for charge for capital gains tax but are not transfers to the accrued income scheme. I could go into more detail and give an example if anyone wishes me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New paragraph 14B of the schedule, which is introduced by amendment No. 225 deals with charitable trusts. We wanted specifically to exclude charities, but in doing so we had to introduce a provision that dealt with the case where the fund which is charitable ceases to be charitable and is therefore no longer entitled to exemption. That is the sort of technicality that must be spelt out and that, for example, is what is included in amendment No. 225.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the situations envisaged by the amendments will rarely occur but it is right that the legislation
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
should be comprehensive and not leave areas of doubt about how the scheme would be applied if such cases arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the other amendments make provision for particular situations. For example, amendment No. 222 simplifies the way in which the accrued income scheme applies to executors. In effect, what it does is treat a transfer on the distribution of an estate as being a transfer from the deceased to the legatee without an intervening transfer to the personal representative—the administrator or the executor. There is no logical reason to interpose the executors in a separate capacity since they are acting only as representatives of the deceased's estate. That is why amendment No. 222 is included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have included the general exemption for charities, and specific provisions are needed because the accrued income scheme does not work by charging the tax treatment of income and capital gains to accrued income—it measures the amount of accrued interest which is then deemed to be income for tax. That particular feature of the scheme means that, unfortunately, the existing income tax relief and special provisions for particular kinds of income, such as that for charities, are not brought into play automatically and we have to make specific provision for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments pick up a number of these provisions which the Bill, when published, did not refer to but which, on consideration, we think would be better spelt out, in some cases for their substantive application and in other cases to make it clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my introductory remarks to clause 69, none of the provisions in the amendments in any way change the nature of the scheme. They do not alter any policy, they merely ensure that the proposals are properly implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for me to detain the Committee on these amendments except to say that I am somewhat alarmed that so many amendments had to be introduced to schedule 20. We appreciate, of course, the Government's efforts to get the scheme right, workable and, hopefully, intelligible to those who will apply it both to themselves and to others. Therefore, it is worrying that the Government have come forward with such a large number of amendments at this stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not receive much notice of the amendments and what we want to do is check through them to ensure that they will work as they stand. We may want to return to them on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surprising that the amendments have to be introduced now. For example, amendment No. 224. is essential to ensure that the legislation does not clash with double taxation and amendment No. 223 charges life assurance companies at 37.5 per cent, which is their normal rate of tax on income. Such points should have been clear at the outset and it should not have been necessary to introduce such amendments. I shall want to ask a question about paragraph 7, but for the moment may I say that we are a little concerned that the Government have tabled so many amendments. We hope that the Government have now got it right, and between now and Report we shall make sure that that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's hopes. We have devoted much time and attention to the scheme.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
A lot of problems arise because accrued income is a new form of income for taxation. To produce everything in a final form in the Finance Bill, when the decision was made only at the end of February, would have been a tall order. As the hon. Lady said, there are basic things such as the tax of insurance companies at 37.5 per cent, but in each case we had to consider whether specific provision had to be made. In checking through them, a number of items came to light which we felt needed to be spelt out. If the hon. Lady uncovers any problems, I hope that she and any other member of the Committee will not wait until Report to discuss them either with myself or the Revenue, because I am sure that we all want the scheme to work satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Lady welcomes the improvements. I take her point that it is a pity that we have had to table a number of amendments at this stage, but the task of dealing with a complicated innovation of this kind from a standing start made it difficult to have a comprehensive provision in the Bill when it was printed. I, simple person that I am, thought that it might be possible to cover the whole business by saying that for the purposes of X, Y and Z, accrued income should be deemed to be income tax and be taxed accordingly. But those who know better than I, and who are far wiser, have convinced themselves and the experts that it all has to be spelt out in detail. That has been done, and I hope that the details are now correct. If any hon. Members have any doubts about them, I hope that they will let me know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That relief, which the clause also seeks to modify in two other minor respects, broadly enables a company to set the costs of exploring and of appraising potential United Kingdom oil discoveries against the profits on which PRT is payable in respect of its existing UK oil fields. Thus it seeks to override the normal field-by-field approach of PRT. It was introduced in 1983 as part of an incentive package to encourage new oil exploration, appraisal and development in the North sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general the relief has been very successful. It has helped to create the fiscal environment that enabled UK exploration and appraisal activity to reach a record high in 1984. But the broad brush scheme of the relief means that in some situations it operates unduly generously. At the extreme, the Exchequer can end up effectively subsidising operations that would not be profitable in per-tax terms. The various limitations in clause 84 are designed to remedy those drawbacks while leaving the general thrust of the relief unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most significant of the limitations is the withdrawl of relief from onshore exploration and appraisal expenditure, which is the part of the clause affected by the amendment. Most exploration and appraisal activity is offshore, and this will continue to benefit as before from immediate PRT relief against a company's PRT profits. But since 1983, several factors have suggested that this relief is not appropriate onshore. The costs of developing onshore fields tend to be only a fraction of those offshore. Onshore drilling costs are typically about one-tenth of those offshore. Even the total cost of producing a barrel of oil from an onshore field, taking account of both capital and operating expenditure, is likely to be only 30–40 per cent of the average cost of producing a similar barrel
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
from one of the North sea fields currently under development. In addition, though generally very profitable, few onshore fields—by virtue of the oil allowance—are big enough to pay PRT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances immediate PRT relief operates almost as an Exchequer subsidy. Furthermore, it distorts the position in favour of those companies that also have offshore producing interests as compared to companies specialising in onshore operations. The proposed change will remove this distortion and ensure a fairer return to the nation from the UK's onshore oil. Notwithstanding the proposed removal of immediate PRT relief for onshore exploration appraisal, onshore activity is still attractive, judging by Britoil's and Enterprise Oil's recent moves to build up their portfolios of onshore acreage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained on Second Reading, under the Bill as published the relief would be withdrawn from any onshore exploration and appraisal expenditure incurred on or after Budget day this year. But further consideration has led us to conclude that that could create genuine difficulties in certain circumstances, which we understand are particularly common in the case of small British companies operating onshore. Those are where the company concerned has made its plans and entered into commitments on the basis of the existing relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore now propose that the withdrawal of the relief for onshore expenditure should be deferred for 12 months. The amendment ensures that only onshore exploration and appraisal expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1986 will be affected by the removal of immediate sideways PRT relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the amendment is to defer for one year the limitation that we seek to put on onshore relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Blair	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Sedgefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary gave us a valuable outline of the essential points in clause 84, and there is no need for me to repeat them in detail. The clause deals specifically with three matters. First, it removes the general relief against PRT for exploration and appraisal expenditure in respect of onshore developments. That prevents the expenses of onshore exploration and appraisal being set off against the PRT on offshore development, which I understood took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Financial Secretary to confirm whether, if the clause is accepted and section 5A of the Oil Taxation Act 1975 is amended, the provisions dealing with abortive exploration expenditure will be unclaimable for onshore developments. I should also like the Financial Secretary to confirm that this does not affect the right for relief for offshore exploration and appraisal expenditure to be claimed, if it is incurred in respect of one field but set off against the PRT profits of other offshore fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 84 also limits the relief for exploration or appraisal expenditure to where it is incurred on the United Kingdom side of the transmedian line—the international median line dividing the continental shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the clause's third effect. It provides that, in calculating the amount of the expenditure on exploration or appraisal, account should be taken of the value
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
of any oil produced in offshore or onshore development. That is a perfectly sensible reason, which I think that we can all understand. If oil is produced in the course of that exploration or appraisal, it is right for that to be taken into account when computing the overall expenditure for the purposes of PRT relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two matters should be raised on clause stand part. The main effect of the changes in the clause will relate to the onshore oil industry. It is right that we should ask the Financial Secretary to tell us the impact of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the onshore oil industry is growing at a rapid rate, especially Dorset, Hampshire and the east midlands. Wood Mackenzie, who are well-known experts in this area, estimate that, between 1979 and 1984, production on onshore oil development trebled, and from 1984 to 1987 is due to treble again. It estimates that at the end of 1987 some 15,000 barrels a day will be produced. However, I notice from the projections that the Wytch Farm field alone is set to go to much greater levels—about 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a day by the end of the decade. Therefore, this is a rapidly expanding industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of exploration or appraisal completions has risen from about two in 1979 to abut 42 projected for 1985. Therefore, the reliefs dealt with in the clause have become increasingly relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Financial Secretary to confirm that the oil allowance—the main taxation allowance given to onshore developments—will remain as it is. As there must be production of some 3.75 million barrels a year before PRT is payable through the oil allowance, very few fields—perhaps only the Wytch Farm field—will be paying PRT at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making an important, if not fundamental change, and we should know what the revenue impact will be. Various figures, between £5 million and £10 million, have been mooted as the advantage to the Revenue. What is the Financial Secretary's analysis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With petroleum tax, we must balance the revenue advantage to the country of a great national asset against the incentive needed for developers to develop. Oil companies obviously work for profit; they have exploited the profitable parts of oil fields, and have not paid as much attention to the unprofitable parts. I do not blame them; that is a natural form of business. Oil companies have sometimes been compared, unkindly, with the Victorian coal owners in their exploitation of assets. Nowadays much is said about enhanced oil recovery, and I gather that the United Kingdom Offshore Operators' Association has put certain taxation plans which I think that the Chancellor mentioned in his Budget statement. Can the Financial Secretary tell the Committee whether there has been any advance in Government thinking about taxation plans to increase oil recovery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of oil taxation is the revenue coming to the Government. North sea oil is a national asset that is of crucial importance to the survival of our economy. The treatment of North sea oil is very sensitive, first because the oil price produces the sort of troubles and tributions that have occurred recently. The Treasury placed a memorandum before the Select Committee on Energy, showing that for every 1$ a barrel drop in the price of oil, some £350 million is wiped off our oil trade balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quizzed the Financial Secretary on the impact of the exchange rate on oil at Chancellor's question time.
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
The impact is immense. Government estimates show that almost £2,000 million of extra revenue accrued as a result of the drop in the sterling-dollar price of oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This national asset is sensitive in the ways that I have described, but still, through petroleum revenue tax, royalties and advance corporation tax the Government will be receiving in 1984–85 some £12 billion; in 1985–86, £13.5 billion and in 1986–87, £11.5 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask what use has been made of the oil revenue that has flowed into the Exchequer. After 1986–87 the oil revenue is set to decline and that is a great worry. Election forecasters could look at the oil revenue figures and find early 1987 to be the optimum time, where the Exchequer is concerned, for a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must put on record that although the Labour Government from 1974 and 1979 received some £600 million of oil revenue, by the end of 1987 the Conservative Government will have received almost £74,000 million. What has happened to that money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wood Mackenzie's report, which is not exactly a Socialist publication—they are no doubt glad that I am putting that on the record—said last November:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1986"— </p></blockquote>
it means the end of 1986—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the UK will reach a crossroads. Lower oil production implies a fall of about £1 billion in the oil surplus. The big question is whether non-oil exports will grow sufficiently to compensate."</p></blockquote>
The problem is that our manufacturing industry is in such decline that the consequences for the balance of trade when oil runs out are truly frightening. When historians look back on this Government—I say this in a general sense, Miss Fookes—I believe that while they may not necessarily remember what has hit the headlines in the past five or six years, they will remember this Government being given the unique benefit of North sea oil and squandering it on paying for mass unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Miss Fookes. It is always as well to spare the embarrassment of Conservative Members over their record. But when we are looking at petroleum tax, we should keep in mind that this is a great national asset which has been squandered in the most irresponsible fashion by the present Government, and that we need a Government who use our resources in not merely a caring way, but an efficient way. We shall have to wait for a Socialist Government to ensure that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond very briefly. Despite the last few pre-election remarks of the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), let me start by complimenting him. The other day he showed a remarkable grasp of the complexities of taxation. The interrelationship of PRT safeguard and uplift, let alone CT, is not an easy subject for those not familiar with oily matters to understand. Although I do not wish to be rude to my excellent officials, the hon. Gentleman described the other two aspects of the clause rather better than I could have done, and I see no need for me to enhance his excellent description.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
Having said that, I shall touch on one or two specific points raised by the hon. Gentleman because I feel that they are germane. He asked whether I could confirm that if clause 84 were passed, section 5 provisions for abortive relief would not apply. He is absolutely correct. Section 5(1) applies only to expenditure up to 16 March 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was equally correct when he asked whether the removal of this onshore relief would leave the offshore reliefs in place. He asked me to confirm that the size of the oil allowance would mean, almost by definition, that many of the onshore fields would not come within PRT. He is right in the sense that, as far as we can see, Wytch farm would be only the field that would clearly come within that. Obviously we are ever hopeful, and we would not want to deny the possibility' of such developments. But the hon. Gentleman is right to say that with the oil allowance, which is 250,000 tonnes per chargeable period or 500,000 tonnes a year—or 1 million tonnes for the offshore fields outside the southern basin approved after 1 April—it will not encompass much more than Wytch farm onshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked me to put on record a specific point about revenue. Given that the amendment that we have already passed seeks to limit the arrival of the revenue from limiting the onshore provisions, the expected revenue from that part of the clause will be running at some £10 million per year. But there is another aspect of the clause, as the hon. Gentleman said. Subsections (4) and (5) limit the relief to the net cost, and that in itself will give a continuing revenue gain that we estimate at some £10 million a year. So the totality after April 1986 will enhance the revenue to the nation by some £20 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about enhanced oil recovery. It was linked to the issue of incrementals. The hon. Gentleman is right; this is an important long-term area of our North sea asset developments. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Chancellor announced in the Budget that after the evidence put forward last year, we thought that so far there was no economic case for further incentives. We also said, however, that we would keep the matter under review and that we would be anxious to see data and information at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member then asked me to put on record the position in regard to the onshore oil and gas fields. It was right for him to ask me to remind hon. Members and to put some facts before the Committee so that the outside world can be more aware of the size and position of our onshore oil and gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member rightly said, onshore oil and gas is expected to be an increasingly important source of energy and revenue over the coming decades. Although the search for onshore oil and gas has been going on since 1918, it is only in the last ten years or so that the true value of our onshore resources has come to light. During that period several onshore fields have been discovered—Wytch farm, Welton and Humbly Grove—with potential reserves large enough to make a significant contribution to the UK economy as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To date, actual production onshore has been relatively modest—1.7 million tonnes over the period 1975–1984. But there are now 13 onshore fields
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
onstream, producing a total return, that is to the company and to the Exchequer, of around £50 million last year. Those figures are expected to increase substantially over the next ten years, as known large onshore fields reach their full potential and some of the 27 fields still at present classed as "discoveries" move into the production phase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To date, the real surge in onshore activity has been in the various processes which necessarily precede actual production—notably in exploration and appraisal operations. In 1984 alone, 25 exploration wells and 12 appraisal wells were started, a big increase on any previous year. Rig activity onshore showed a similarly dramatic rise, with total rig years more than doubling between 1983 and 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are of course welcome trends, but not ones to be encouraged to the point where the Government are effectively subsidising the sort of onshore operation that would not otherwise. be viable. I gave the figures in my earlier remarks. The costs of searching for oil and gas onshore are high in absolute terms. But, by comparison with the corresponding costs offshore, the sums involved are relatively low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background—the hon. Member for Sedgefield rightly asked me to give a judgment about the impact on that of our proposed changes— immediate PRT relief for exploration and appraisal expenditure onshore is simply not necessary to ensure that worthwhile projects go ahead. At the extreme it can, as I have said, operate as an Exchequer subsidy, providing a return to the company on projects which would not be economic without the relief. Clause 84(2) is designed to remove this subsidy element, without undermining the sort of onshore activity that can be expected to generate benefits for the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to go into much more detail on the nature of our successful offshore industry. I merely trust that our political views might best be expressed on election platforms rather than on a clause which, I think, seems to commend the support of both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Could the Financial Secretary clarify one point? His first remark on the amendment appeared to emphasise the differential costs between offshore and onshore activity. He mentioned that onshore activity was approximately one tenth of the costs offshore. I was not sure whether he was taking into account what I presume are far greater restoration and operation costs. Do the operation costs have a differential? I assume that the restoration costs have a considerable differential. I believe that the record of onshore companies, particularly those constrained by planning agreements with local authorities, is good on restoration. But that must be expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that was a key factor of the Minister's argument on the amendment, when he replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) he seemed to lay far greater emphasis on the effective closing of a loophole, or an allowance for offshore operators. Obviously, if the sums involved are £20 million that is a considerable loss to the Inland Revenue. I am sure that both sides of the Committee would not oppose that and would support him. However, I am a little confused about the weight between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore could the Financial Secretary give us some idea about the likely long-term life of those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
reserves? He mentioned revenues of possibly £50 million a year and even increasing on that. What sort of lifespan do those reserves have and is it likely geologically that there will be further finds over and above the 27 discovery fields that the Financial Secretary mentioned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From Wood MacKenzie's brief, it seems that such reserves are found in Jurassic and triassic reservoirs. Are there likely to be geological areas elsewhere in Great Britain that have not been explored and are we looking at something more substantial than the Financial Secretary has led us to believe? If so, the disincentive of the clause to offshore companies to chance their arm and explore further onshore could be unfortunate. Presumably, it is the offshore companies that have this experience, expertise and clout to exploit our onshore reserves. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary could clarify those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. This subject is not always clear. Our amendment seeks to delay implementation of the removal of this relief in the clause. When I addressed the amendment I also sought to explain the rationale behind the limitation. The delay was in consequence, but I shall not go back to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) was right to mention the excellent work of the oil and gas industry in the development of wells, exploration, restoration and the way in which they are able to blend in. When I was at the Department of Energy I visited Wytch, farm, which is worth seeing to understand what can be done with intelligent development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With drilling costs there is a one tenth relationship with drilling in deep water in the North sea. The relative costs in total were 34 to 40 per cent per barrel, including all the costs. There was a fundamental difference between the relative risks. The reliefs that we sought to introduce in 1983, which were being limited for onshore development, did not seem as important compared with the relative risks because of the subsidy element that had come in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked how I envisaged the long-term position of the onshore resource. I must write to the hon. Gentleman and to other members of the Committee about that matter because we do not want to debate the geology of the Jurassic period at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that 20 years ago I came home after spending five years in Chicago. I was walking along the promenade at Blackpool with Lawrence Reed, who was not then a member of the House. He was an extremely nice and intelligent man. He pointed out across the harbour and said to an unbelieving Moore, "There's a lot of oil and gas out there and it's on the other side too." At the time no one believed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone looking at the area is conscious of the fact that we do not want to make any over-emphatic statements about its potential. We hope that the key is to get the regime right so that the balance is fair to the nation as taxpayers, and fair to the companies to encourage rational development. I tried to explain that balance in my attempt to show the nature of the onshore industry. We believe that we have got the balance right and that the removal of the relief is sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I correct one slightly incorrect impression that the hon. Member may have? The onshore removal of relief has a £10 million addition to the revenue. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
other £10 million comes from a feature of the clause that seeks to change the accounting relief that was theoretically given in cost reliefs to extended production tests in oil. I hope that that explanation answers the hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point relates to environmental effects because the clause relates to the onshore industry which, as we have heard, is growing substantially. There is strong environmental opposition from many quarters to such development. I should like to hear the Minister's views, because several points arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all recall the Shell or Esso advert which showed an ideal enviroment after onshore excavation, but that is very much the exception. Such an approach is to be welcomed, and if all onshore exploration companies acted that way and made the environment fine afterwards, we would welcome it. Is the Treasury prepared to use tax policies to give incentives to provide a good environment after onshore exploration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wytch farm has been referred to. Its privatisation was forced by the Government against the will of the British Gas Corporation and against the public interest. Public assets were effectively asset-stripped for private profit. One of the effects was that there was less control, not only over production, but over the environmental effect which results when such industries are in private hands. Is the Minister prepared to use taxation policy to help improve the environment or is he saying that that is subject to planning law?

	<section>
	<div class='title'>CHARGEABLE PERIODS RELEVANT TO LIMIT ON TAX PAYABLE AND EXPENDITURE SUPPLEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the Committee if I were to say what is the purpose of the clause. The need for the clause arises from the relatively new practice of carrying out extended production tests. Its purpose is to correct two unintended consequences of the rules for PRT safeguard and uplift reliefs which could now arise as a result of such tests. I am sure that every member of the Committee is fully informed about the nature of the interrelationship between PRT uplift, safeguard and. payback. One works in favour of the taxpayer and the other against. Both are anomalous and need to be put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the changes proposed by the clause are technical, it might be helpful if I explain the two problems and the way in which the clause sets out to solve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, by way of background, I shall say a word about the PRT system to set the two problems in context. PRT is charged—for chargeable periods of six months—on the receipts from oil and gas production less the expenses incurred in finding, extracting, bringing it ashore and putting it into a saleable state. The expenses allowable include an uplift of 35 per cent on certain capital expenditure, the purpose and scope of which I shall describe a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, after deducting any loss carried forward or backward from another period, this computation shows a net profit, an oil allowance representing up to a quarter of a million tonnes of oil is given for the chargeable period of the half year. For offshore fields outside the Southern Basin approved after 1 April 1982, the allowance has been doubled. Any PRT payable after
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
deducting oil allowance is subject for a limited period—this is crucial—to the automatic protection of safeguard relief. The rate of PRT is 75 per cent, and the tax so charged is then deductible in calculating the company's liability to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safeguard is intended to give companies a certain degree of additional protection in the early years of a field's life when its economics are most vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safeguard relief sets a ceiling on the amount of PRT payable for a limited period after first production from a field. Where a participator's adjusted profits for the chargeable period—broadly, income less expenditure other than upliftable expenditure—represents a rate of return of less than 15 per cent on capital, his profits are exempt from PRT. Above this level PRT is limited to 80 per cent—the safeguard taper—of the excess if this is less than the liability under the normal rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duration of safeguard is governed by the number of chargeable periods between the first chargable period and the chargeable period in which payback is reached. Payback is defined as the chargeable period in which cumulative field income first exceeds cumulative outgoings. Safeguard relief applies for the whole of these periods plus half as many again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem comes because the first chargeable period is the period ending at the end of the half calendar year in which cumulative production from the field first exceeds 1000 tonnes. That does not usually happen until full production starts, and it follows that normally the safeguard period itself does not begin until full production starts; that is after the field has been developed. However, an extended production test carried out before either a development decision or the incurring of field development expenditure can result in considerable oil production and so trigger the period. Where that happens, there may then be a considerable length of time—possibly some years because oil field development is a lengthy business—where no oil is being produced, but which nevertheless is taken into account in calculating how long safeguard lasts after development costs are recovered. It was never intended that a potentially long unproductive period should be taken into account when the formula for limiting the period of safeguard was introduced in 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution to that problem is in subsection (1). It corrects the anomaly by providing for chargeable periods in which little or no oil is produced to be left out of account for the purpose of calculating how long safeguard lasts after development costs have been recovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the second anomaly with which this clause deals. It concerns the determination of the time of payback. This is the time when, broadly, a participator has recovered his development costs and first makes a profit. It is important because payback governs the length of time for which uplift and safeguard reliefs are available. I have explained safeguard in connection with the first anomaly and it may be helpful if I explain uplift. Uplift is given at 35 per cent of qualifying expenditure which, broadly speaking, is initial exploration and development expenditure incurred before the end of the period in which payback in a particular field is reached. Relief is thus given on 135 per cent of the amount of qualifying expenditure. The uplift is compensation for the fact that interest and other costs of financing are not allowable expenses for PRT purposes.

	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
In this case, it is the company which is at risk. When payback is reached during the period of an extended production test because the value of the oil produced exceeds field expenditure to date, there is a risk that both uplift and safeguard reliefs will be prematurely cut off. Subsection (3) removes that risk by providing that payback is not to be regarded as reached until a field has received development consent and produces, in a chargeable period ending after such consent has been given, more than 1,000 tonnes of oil. That will ensure that the carrying out of extended production tests will not put at risk uplift in respect of the major field development costs and will not have the effect of unduly curtailing the length of a safeguard period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for speaking at some length but, from his previous comments, I believe that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) will know that this is a very complicated area and that those two anomalies are unintentional. One gives too much relief, the other offers too much risk, and the clause seeks to correct them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his clear explanation of the clause and because of that I can be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires a certain familiarity with oil taxation language which it is not always easy to acquire and I shall be grateful if the Financial Secretary will help me with one or two points. I refer not to the nature of the clause and what it is supposed to deal with but to the nature of the remedy for the anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that I have understood, I ask whether it is not the case that basically, one anomaly is disadvantageous and the other is advantageous to the taxpayer. However, the safeguard system would mean, for example, that if it took, say, four years until the time of payback, there would be safeguard relief for two years following the four-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, if there are extended production tests, payback might be reached only after a prolonged period which would allow the taxpayer to take that into account when computing the period of safeguard. Therefore, safeguard might be unnaturally prolonged as a result of that, which, obviously, would be wrong. To get to payback might take a long time, during which there would be several chargeable periods, and once production got going safeguard would give much more than the taxpayer needed because it would give half of that period up to payback. I am not entirely sure about that and shall be grateful if the Financial Secretary will confirm that I am correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position which is disadvantageous to the taxpayer is when payback could be reached at, say, an early time during an extended production test. Then, of course, the period of safeguard following the achievement of payback would be limited. Additionally, I understand that uplift operates as a supplement on what, in broad terms, is capital expenditure. The safeguard relief would be very limited because of the short time that it had taken to get to payback and the uplift, and, correspondingly, the 35 per cent supplement, would be very much lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the two anomalies are different, the schemes to deal with them are essentially the same— that is, to work with chargeable periods when there is oil production of significant, not negligible, amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
To deal with the first anomaly, subsections (1) and (2) limit the duration of safeguard by excluding from the calculation chargeable periods that yield less than 1,000 tonnes. In other words, if there is less than 1,000 tonnes, that is not taken into account in the payback period, hence the safeguard's duration is more limited. The second anomaly, covered by subsections (3) and (4), means that payback happens only in respect of a chargeable period ending after a development decision has been made—that is the first precondition—and during which more than 1,000 tonnes has been produced. Again, we are discussing large amounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, that 1,000 tonne figure was not plucked out of thin air but chosen for a particular reason. I appreciate that a figure must be reached at some stage. No doubt the strict application of a limit is necessary in this instance, and the oil taxation office has made the necessary calculations. But I should like to know how the 1,000-tonne figure was hit upon, whether any estimates have been made of the effect of the measure and how greatly the changes will hit the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be jumping ahead by a clause, as this is a complex matter, about which the Minister certainly gave us a good and detailed explanation. Does clause 85 mean that the cost of extended production tests will rise? If so, will some smaller oil companies decrease the number of their tests? Is that what the Government want, and is it in the country's interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My reply to the last question of the hon. Member for Burnely (Mr. Pike) is no. Essentially, we are correcting two very different anomalies, one of which would have worked against the interests of the oil company. In both instances, we are tightening up the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) described matters extremely well. In respect of taxpayer's relief, there is a major difference between E and A development, and exploration and real development. The problem is that a non-genuine production period may have continued for five years, thus creating a notional safeguard period and giving potential profits greater than would be merited. There was no deterrent; it was an anomalous feature of a new aspect of oil field development called the extended production test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An addition to the uplift problem is that the company doing the exploration may reach payback very early by means of the trigger, without our proposed change. Its exploration development costs may be offset by another offshore field. The amount of oil involved might be modest and quite irrelevant. However, when the company needs the protection of safeguard and uplift in its production stage and has much heavier investments, it would not be able to receive it. Clearly, it is right to remove that anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1,000-tonne figure is regarded as a reasonable de minimis limit. I shall be happy to write to the hon. Member for Sedgefield with a more detailed explanation, but the figure created no difficulty either when I was at the Department of Energy or during our discussions with the oil taxation office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>QUALIFYING ASSETS; EXCLUSION OF LAND AND CERTAIN BUILDINGS ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the clause briefly because there are those outside who are more than interested in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this clause is to remove a charge to PRT which would otherwise arise on any tariff or disposal proceeds arising from land and certain buildings and structures on land—such as a company's head office. This is a limited class of assets in respect of which the acquisition or erection costs, if any, are not allowable against PRT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad purpose of the charging provisions of the Oil Taxation Act 1983 was to bring into charge to PRT incidental receipts such as tariffs or disposal proceeds in respect of assets for which PRT relief is available for the related costs. This clause concerns a particular class of assets in respect of which some costs are allowable against PRT, and some are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Oil Taxation Act 1975 provides that the cost of acquiring land and buildings onshore—other than those
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
used for specified activities such as the initial treatment or storage of oil—are not allowable against PRT. An example would be a company head office used for the administration of North sea activities. But, because the day-to-day operating costs—such as those incurred on rates and maintenance—at least partly qualify for relief because the building is used for a PRT purpose, any receipts from the asset—for example, if it is sold or rented out—would be charged to PRT even though the capital costs of the building had not been allowed. This is clearly unfair and the clause therefore removes this limited class of assets from the scope of the PRT charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
