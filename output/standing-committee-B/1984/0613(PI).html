<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p>(except clauses 3,10, 35,40, 54, 64 and 87 and schedules 12, 16 and 22)</p>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Eggar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Enfield, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. I understand that on Tuesday the two Front Benches agreed to take the oil taxation clauses out of order. Far be it from me, as a member of last year's Finance Bill Committee, to criticise an agreement between the two Front Benches. We are all extremely grateful for the progress that has been made in this year's Committee. However, we mere mortals on the Back Benches did not know of the reordering of the clauses until we glanced at our amendment papers on Tuesday morning—or, in some cases, until we arrived on Tuesday afternoon.<br><br>
I am sure that if you had been here, Mr. Lamond, you would agree that we should be grateful to the Treasury for the way in which it has come forward with details on the Government's new clauses and amendments. For understandable reasons, the arrangement of business has to be altered at relatively short notice, and I hope that in future the Treasury will put a note round to the members of the Committee just as it does when it is explaining Government new clauses or amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The way in which the matter was dealt with was perfectly in order. The resolution to alter the order of business may have been agreed between the Front Benches, but it was also accepted by the Committee. However, the hon. Gentleman has my sympathy.<br><br>
I trust that the Front Benches have noted his point, which I consider reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too, have considerable sympathy with my hon. Friend. Why has the Chair allowed a resolution proposed at such short notice to be tabled and debated? The Chair does not normally take starred amendments, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A starred amendment can be taken with the agreement of the Chair. The Chairman always does his best to ensure the smooth working of the Committee; whether a starred amendment is accepted is up to whoever is occupying the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Lamond. It is not for the Opposition Front Bench to tell Government Back Benchers what the Government are doing. I for my part made sure that my hon. Friends knew about the change in order.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) has got it slightly wrong. He said that the clauses on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
petroleum revenue tax had been taken out of order; in fact the effect of the change in the order of business was to delay consideration of the stamp duty clauses. The Opposition would have protested strongly if the Government had not changed the order to take the stamp duty clauses at a later date. The Government tabled new clause 25 on Monday, and it would have been outrageous for such a major new clause to be considered on the following day. The Government would not have wished that, which is why they readily accepted our suggestion that stamp duty should be dealt with today rather than on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we have spent enough time on this matter. When I said that both Front Benches might take note of the point made by the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar), I was thinking of a day when the Front Benches might have changed places and those who are now in opposition might be in government. However, we have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's point of order at Some length. I hope that he is satisfied.</span></p>

Clause 74</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TAKEOVERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 239, in page 75, line 13, leave out subsection (9).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 240, in page 75, line 19, leave out subsection (10).</p>
<p>No. 244, in clause 75, page 77, line 15, leave out subsection (9).</p>
<p>No. 245, in clause 75, page 77, line 21, leave out subsection (10).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>; Amendment No. 240 is consequential upon amendment No. 239. Amendments Nos. 244 and 245 would amend clause 75, but they cover the same point as the others.<br><br>
Clause 74 appears to abolish stamp duty on exchanges of shares where one company is taken over by another. We may discuss the abolition on clause stand part, but I wish now to examine subsection (9), which seems to conflict with subsection (2).<br><br>
Subsection (2) states that stamp duty
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be chargeable on an instrument transferring the shares in company B"</p></blockquote>
at the time of takeover. It is the kernel of the clause.<br><br>
Subsection (9) provides that an instrument dealing with a transfer of shares
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be taken to be duly stamped unless it is stamped with the duty to which it would be liable but for"</p></blockquote>
subsection (2).<br><br>
I find it difficult to reconcile those two subsections. I cannot understand why subsection (2) abolishes the duty, while subsection (9) provides that an instrument shall be valid only if it is stamped with the duty. I shall be grateful for clarification of both subsections (2) and (9).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Ian Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not wish to intervene on the point of order because, as you properly said, Mr. Lamond, the matter had been fully aired. However, perhaps I can say for the record that the Treasury Bench will take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0807">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
note of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar). Clearly we are all trying to organise the business of the Committee in the way that is most helpful to all its members, not forgetting the Chair.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) asked about the implications of subsection (9), particularly in relation to subsection (2). I remind the Committee that the clause provides relief from ad valorem stamp duty on paper-for-paper exchanges on the occasion of a takeover, and for similar exchanges where a company has already obtained control of another company. The clause supersedes an extra-statutory concession which has had exactly the same effect. Therefore, we are not introducing a change but validating what already happens.<br><br>
Subsection (9) provides that any instrument which it is claimed is totally exempt from stamp duty under clause 74 must be adjudicated unless it is stamped with the duty to which it would be liable but for the clause.<br><br>
The subsection states
<br><blockquote><p>"unless … it has … been stamped."</p></blockquote>
If it had been stamped unnecessarily, there would be no question of stamp duty being payable. It would have been paid.<br><br>
The circumstances envisaged in the second half of the provision is more likely. Subsection (9) continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"or it has, in accordance with section 12 of the Stamp Act 1891, been stamped with a particular stamp denoting that it is not charge able with any duty."</p></blockquote>
Adjudication is provided by section 12 of the Stamp Act 1891. It is the term by which we describe the process when the commissioners of Inland Revenue are formally requested to determine the liability to duty of an instrument and the amount of duty, if any. An adjudication stamp is conclusive evidence that a document has been correctly stamped. If the commissioners decide that a document does not need to be stamped and that it is not chargeable, it can be stamped
<br><blockquote><p>"Adjudged not chargeable with any stamp duty."</p></blockquote>
That is the formal phrase used in such cases. If the commissioners decide that a document is chargeable, they assess the duty and, when the instrument is stamped for assessment purposes, they further stamp it "Adjudged duly stamped".<br><br>
The adjudication process is especially used for complicated transactions and takeover provisions clearly fall under that definition. Adjudication establishes whether an instrument is properly exempt under the clause or, if it is partially exempt, the degree to which it is partially exempt. Such adjudication is necessary to ensure that stamping for duty purposes is correct.<br><br>
I hope that with that explanation the hon. Gentleman will be content.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have understood the Economic Secretary explaining to us that if company A takes over company B, the people running company A will go to the Inland Revenue and ask for agreement that stamp duty is not liable. In other words, they will claim that the takeover is covered by clause 74. The Inland Revenue will then stamp a document to show that stamp duty is not payable and the document can be regarded as a legal document in any subsequent legal proceedings.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: indicated assent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now understand that the crunch is in the second part of subsection (9) rather than in the first part, and so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 241, in page 75, leave out lines 27 to 29.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 242, in page 75, line 30, leave out subsection (12).</p>
<p>No. 246, in clause 75, page 77, line 28, leave out from "1985" to end of line 30.</p>
<p>No. 249, in clause 76, page 78, line 31, leave out from "1985" to end of line 33.</p>
<p>No. 251, in clause 79, page 80, line 20, leave out from "1985" to end of line 22.</p>
<p>No. 252, in clause 79, page 80, line 23, leave out subsection (4).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, amendment No. 242 is consequential on amendment No. 241 and other amendments in the group deal with other clauses but cover the same point.<br><br>
The amendments cover another complicated aspect of the clause, and I do not have some hon. Gentlemen's personal experience of company takeovers. Subsection (11)(<i>b</i>) grants what I call one week's grace. I am not clear why
<br><blockquote><p>"instruments executed on or after 19th March 1985 which are stamped on or after 26th March 1985"</p></blockquote>
should be covered by
<br><blockquote><p>"The preceding provisions of this section."</p></blockquote>
Surely there should be one date when the subsection applies—26 March or possibly 19 March, the date of the Budget. I do not understand what appears to be a special provision for one week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a very fair question. I commend him for being assiduous enough to spot other clauses where the same words are used. The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the fact that the measure represents seven days after the date of the Budget.<br><br>
Subsection (11)(<i>b</i>) deals with instruments which are executed on or during the first seven days after Budget day, but which are not stamped until 26 March, a week or more later.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
Clause 74 applies in principle to all instruments executed on or after 19 March. Resolution 33 gave temporary statutory effect to this proposal. However, the resolution could not be put to the House till the end of the Budget statement, instead of at the beginning, because stamp duty provisions are not subject to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act. Thus they can come into effect immediately, with provisional application, with a resolution on Budget day. Resolutions subject to that Act can be subsequently reversed, by the Committee or by the House, so it is proper to introduce them immediately in a provisional form.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0808">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
Stamp duty is not subject to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act for a good reason—one cannot undo what has happened. We cannot amend stamp duty retrospectively. The laws of stamp duty are very complicated—they go back to 1694, with a major Act in 1891, and various other Acts from time to time.<br><br>
The result is that stamp duty applies at the rate in force at the time, and we cannot change the rate retrospectively. The rule that documents have to be stamped according to what is proper at the time would conflict if we did. Therefore, by law it is not possible to exempt from stamp duty transactions made before the resolution on the stamp duty arrangements at the end of the Budget debate. If it were a duty on transactions, the applicable tax would relate to the transaction. However as it relates to the documents which have to be taxed according to the regime in force, there is no authority for documents to be stamped in any other way until the resolution is passed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear why the resolution could not have been put to the House on 19 March.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of practice. It is not a provisional but an absolute resolution. The Government have taken a view—I understand their predecessors took a similar view—that we should not introduce a resolution on Budget Day which has immediate effect if it cannot be subsequently amended. Resolutions taken on Budget Day are made in relation to taxes and duties covered by the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, so Parliament has time to consider them. If it thinks better of them, it can change them. However, if we passed this resolution on Budget Day, we could not amend it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the Economic Secretary make that point before. However, there are three dates involved—the date of the Budget, the date of the end of the Budget debate when we pass resolutions, and the date on which the Bill becomes an Act by receiving Royal Assent.<br><br>
I understand that the Economic Secretary is saying that if we passed a resolution on the day of the Budget, it would not be amendable. However, we can only amend these arrangements when considering this Bill. I was not aware that we could amend the resolution on 26 March. I do not understand the difference between passing a resolution on 26 March which is not amendable and all the arguments which the Economic Secretary is putting to us. They would apply as much to a resolution on 26 March as to a resolution on 19 March. If we were to pass an amendment we would do so during consideration of the Bill and not on 26 March.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I was trying to explain the reason why a resolution on stamp duty was different from a resolution on other taxes. I explained that the Government considered it proper to introduce, as all Governments have done, resolutions on Budget Day where the subject matter is amendable. If a resolution is introduced which is not amendable, it is not fair to introduce it without notice in the House of Commons. The view which we have taken, following precedent, is that a resolution relating to stamp duty should not be introduced on Budget Day. It was announced on Budget Day, but we took it to the House a week later so that it was not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
asked to pass judgment on it instantaneously without having had a chance to consider it.<br><br>
Therefore, there was a limited period in which the stamp duty resolution could be considered. It could have been discussed in the Budget debate had hon. Members wished to devote their attention to it. However, had we included it in resolutions to be moved on Budget Day, the die would have been cast. It could have been cancelled later but it could not have been disapplied, whereas ordinary tax changes announced on Budget Day may be disapplied. The House or the Finance Bill Committee can overturn a provisional Collection of Taxes Act because, by definition, those resolutions provide that the collection of taxes is provisional, subject to the approval of the House.<br><br>
In the case of stamp duty, because of the difference in nature between stamp duty and other taxes, because it applies to documents and not to transactions, and because the whole of stamp duty law is constructed on the basis that a document must be stamped in the correct form at the time and no subsequent amendment can be passed to change the rate at which a document should be stamped once it has been stamped—there is no arrangement for rebate or anything like that—the provision for changes in stamp duty need to be in a separate resolution brought at a later stage. We have taken the view that to introduce the resolutions a week later fulfils the need to give Parliament a chance, should it want it, to object.<br><br>
Of couse, the House could change the stamp duty provisions but not for the period during which it had operated following that resolution. When we reach new clause 24, the committee will find that it provides for a number of changes to take place from 1 August and not from the same starting dates as the provisions in the Bill.<br><br>
It is a most extraordinary position, but, for those who have studied it, stamp duty is an extraordinary form of duty. The different arrangements are made to follow the whole structure of stamp duty provisions which are already in force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, no one here was a Member of the House in 1694, and I am not clear why we are bound in this way. What would be the effect if the Committee refused to allow clause 74 to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the effect would be that its provisions would lapse after 31 days and life would be as if the clause had never been in force. However, the resolution would have given cover to the clause until such time as it lapsed. There would be a period from the date of the resolution until 31 days after the clause was thrown out during which its provisions would operate. But from then on matters would be the same as before Budget day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are exploring a fascinating byway. Much seems to depend on when we reached clause 74. Perhaps we should have done so on Tuesday; people's liability would have been reduced by two days if we had rejected it then. The Minister appears to be saying that if the clause is rejected, people will be liable to stamp duty on the documents from 26 March until 31 days after today; he seems to be nodding in agreement.<br><br>
There would be no possibility of going back, as there would be after a change in income tax or corporation tax.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0809">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got it back to front. The potential taxpayer would have been exempted from the time of the resolution until 31 days after the clause was rejected. He would then go back to being liable, rather than the other way round.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that correction. Nevertheless, my point would apply if the stamp duty were being increased. I am discussing the principle of the 1694 Act which seems to give rise to the peculiarity.<br><br>
If we reject the clause people will be exempt from 26 March until 31 days hence. I am unclear about what would happen about the period between 19 March and 26 March. My amendment relates to that odd period of one week, which seems to apply to stamp duty and to nothing else in this context. I am anxious to establish the principle applying both to increases and to reductions, as well as to abolition. The phrase in question is dotted throughout this part of the Bill, in respect of a number of changes in stamp duty. We are being asked to make special provision for the period between 19 March and 26 March.<br><br>
I understand why stamp duty is different from every other tax, but it appears to me that the provision could apply equally to many other taxes—for example, to VAT. Let us suppose that the House passed a resolution increasing—or abolishing—VAT on a specific transaction. There would be a Budget resolution to put it into effect from that date. But if at a later date the House rejected the measure, what would happen in the interim? Some of the money collected could not be reimbursed. Again, some would not have been collected—and could not be.<br><br>
This matter of stamp duty is very peculiar. Other taxes not covered by the provisional collection rules could have a similar impact on individuals and businesses. We should be told why stamp duty is to be treated differently from the other taxes—although I appreciate that income tax and corporation tax problems can be put right retrospectively.</span></p>
<p>5 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>; The implementation of new VAT coverage or rates usually occurs only after a certain interval has elapsed; indeed, that happened last year. But that is not the essential point in reltion to stamp duty. Like all other taxes, VAT is capable of being adjusted although that would be very complicated. However, stamp duty cannot be amended retrospectively; that is its unique feature. Twelve years ago another provision was added to section 50 of the Finance Act 1973 which provided that resolutions could be introduced. Otherwise, stamp duty changes would not take place until the Finance Bill was enacted.<br><br>
If a favourable change in stamp duty were announced at Budget time, no one would carry out any transactions for the next four months, which is clearly unsatisfactory. Therefore, the procedure was adjusted so that a resolution could be introduced and, provided the clause was passed, the new coverage would be effective from the date of the resolution. If the new provision was rejected it did not go back to the date of the resolution, but from 31 days of Parliament's passing that judgment.<br><br>
It is an extraordinary mechanical arrangement, but short of rewriting the stamp duty provisions, which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
would not be sensible, we must operate within the existing framework.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of the period from 19 to 26 March. During that week, documents must be executed and stamped under the old regime because the resolution was not passed at that stage.<br><br>
Subsection (11)(<i>b</i>) provides that any document that is executed after Budget day and is stamped after the resolution on 26 March will be deemed valid if it is stamped at the regime applying from 26 March onwards. We could not apply that provision back because the resolution was not carried. That cannot be done under the stamp duty structure. The small number of documents that were stamped as well as executed that week, would operate under the old regime.<br><br>
Documents that were executed before 26 March and after Budget day up to 26 March can be stamped on the new basis, provided that it is done after the resolution has been passed. The provision to which the hon. Gentleman has drawn attention makes that possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says that the documents will be stamped on the new basis, does he mean not paying stamp duty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In this case, it means not paying stamp duty or paying it in a different partial fashion because the terms on which stamp duty applies are changed by the clauses.<br><br>
For example, clause 75 refers to companies in liquidation. It is comparable to clause 74, but deals with a technicality. In clauses 74 and 75, the consideration for stamp is the amount which relates to cash consideration. It may be that some stamp is payable, but the quantum of the duty payable is determined by the rules regarding the paper-for-paper part as opposed to the cash part, which is liable.<br><br>
Although it is generally true that this exempts the transaction from stamp duty—that will be the effect after 26 March—in some cases it exempts one part of the transition but not the other part, which remains liable.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 74 is to provide exemption from stamp duty for transfers of shares in a company which is being or has been taken over in exchange for shares or certain other securities. Whether those other securities count as cash, and whether that part of the consideration for the takeover is exempt, depends on the definition of those other securities. So it sometimes affects the quantum as well as the liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a fascinating subject. The Economic Secretary has convinced me that we need to have a thorough look at the stamp duty provisions. It is disappointing that the reforming zeal of this Government petered out during the last 12 months, and that they have been content with piecemeal changes to stamp duty. I say "reforming zeal" because it is a phrase that I imagine they would use. It would not be my phrase—at least, I should not put the emphasis on reform.<br><br>
Enthusiasm for the changes in our taxation system that the Government were so anxious to introduce a year ago and all the talk about fiscal neutrality in reform, have evaporated. There appears to be a need for a thorough examination of stamp duty, to examine some of the peculiarities. I am not satisfied that stamp duty is not analogous with a number of other taxes, where it would be difficult to reimburse or recover tax

as a result of changes made subsequently in the course of the Finance Bill. Meantime, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 243, in page 75, line 36, leave out subsection (13). This is a probing amendment, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will explain the purpose of subsection (13).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (13) provides statutory cover for documents stamped in accordance with the extra-statutory concession announced on 27 July 1984.<br><br>
The Stamp Act provides that documents cannot normally be used for legal purposes unless stamped in accordance with the law at the time of execution. The documents, stamped in accordance with the concession announced last July, were clearly not stamped in accordance with the law at the time of execution. Strictly, therefore, a company registrar can refuse to accept such documents for the transfer of shares. In practice, registrars have been prepared to accept the concession, and, as far as is known, no difficulties have arisen. The subsection, however, provides the necessary cover for instruments stamped under the terms of the concession, in case any query was raised about them, and it is designed to put the validity of the instruments beyond doubt for the future.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may recall that the concession announced last July followed legal judgments which showed that the previously used method—often known as the pref-trick; a complicated form of company reconstruction, which takes place in a takeover—was thought to be a means of avoiding stamp duty on takeovers of paper for paper.<br><br>
A subsequent legal decision cast doubt on the matter and, indeed, indicated that if the concession was not given, companies would probably be in doubt about their liability to stamp duty. It would probably take a long time in the courts to sort out individual cases. So the Government announced that they would grant an extra-statutory concession with effect from last July, and that concession is validated by the Bill.<br><br>
As I said, we have no evidence that any problems have arisen, but who knows whether at some time in the future someone may have a completely different reason for wishing to query a document stamped last October in order to cast doubt on a transaction. The provision is a safety measure to cover that period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings me to one of my objections to the clause. The excellent notice that we received from the Inland Revenue referred to an extra-statutory concession with effect from last July, but I was not clear of the reasons for it. The Economic Secretary has now given us to understand that people did not think that takeovers were subject to stamp duty until a legal case in 1984. I am not familiar with the case to which he referred because there is no reference to it in the notes that we received from the Treasury, and I therefore had no reason to pursue inquiries among my legal friends.<br><br>
I had assumed that such transactions had always been subject to stamp duty and had always been understood to be subject to stamp duty. I did not realise that a legal decision had found people to be liable for a duty
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
for which they had not previously been considered liable.<br><br>
It appears that following that legal case, the Inland Revenue decided that it would not collect the duty anyway. That seems rather peculiar. On other occasions the Government have been much less generous in dealing with people who have suddenly discovered that they are liable to tax. My hon. Friends will remember the example of workplace nurseries. For years people thought that they were not liable for tax on their employers' contributions to the cost of workplace nurseries. 'When it was decided that they were, indeed, liable, the Government not only implemented that decision—a decision not of a court of law but of the Inland Revenue—but tried to collect the tax due for the previous six years.<br><br>
The Government appear to have been much more solicitous towards those engaged in takeovers. Not only did they not try to collect the back tax, but they decided not to collect the duty for the following year and to validate that extra-statutory concession by a clause in the Finance Bill. I object strongly to such political discrimination.<br><br>
In view of the silence on this point in the Treasury note, I urge the Economic Secretary to be more forthcoming to the Committee. What was the legal case, and why did the Government decide that the law should not be applied to people engaged in company takeovers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be tempted into comparisons between this and other cases. Other cases depend on interpretations of existing laws where the Revenue believes that they should apply if the conditions fit. But it has never been the intention that this type of transaction should be taxed. The exemption goes back a long way. Since 1927, there has been statutory exemption from stamp duty for company mergers.<br><br>
However, the old exemption was tightly drawn and does not fit modern commercial practice. Nowadays mergers involve the issuing of shares in company A for those in company B. In the old days, company A, which would be a new company, would often issue shares for both company B and company C.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
Because the 1927 exemption, which was designed to deal with takeovers and mergers, did not coincide with practice as it has gradually developed in recent years, special means were adopted by those organising mergers to construct them in such a way that they would be exempt. That was considered perfectly all right by all concerned until the decision in the Furniss v. Dawson case in 1984 that such a transaction could be seen as being designed to avoid tax rather than having a genuine commercial purpose, and could therefore give rise to a tax liability. It is still not clear whether such cases apply to stamp duty, but it seems probable. Although the legality of any arrangement in an individual merger would be for the courts to decide when they had all the facts and figures, there could have been a long period of uncertainty.<br><br>
In July last year, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made a statement—I can let the hon. Gentleman have a copy if he is interested—in which he announced that the Government intended to apply a concession that carried the spirit of the 1927 exemption. But because it was an extra-statutory concession and not a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0811">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
statutory cover, it was possible that the documents could be queried at a later stage, which would undo the technical legality of the transactions. Primary legislation in the Bill now validates those transactions and makes the extra-statutory concession unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who decided to introduce the extra-statutory concession, the Board of Inland Revenue or a Treasury Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All such decisions are approved by Ministers. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made the statement and Treasury Ministers take responsibility for it. I shall let the hon. Gentleman have a copy later. I am afraid I have not got a spare one with me now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My dislike and suspicion of the clause are increasing with every comment that the Economic Secretary makes, but I shall reserve my comments for the stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me revert for a moment to the Economic Secretary's explanation of subsection (13). I should be grateful if he would explain why those engaged in takeovers should not be subject to stamp duty. After all, it was open to the Financial Secretary to issue a different press release a year ago. He could have announced that he was putting everyone on notice that the position would not be changed by this year's Finance Bill, and that they had better pay the stamp duty from now on as a result of the legal case.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could explain the reasoning behind the decision. I should like to know how much the change will cost and why the Government decided on this in preference to other tax cuts. I can think of several far more meritorious tax cuts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government decided to introduce the clause because we wished to maintain the status quo for the exemption of stamp duty on such mergers. The hon. Gentleman may take a different view. He may say that is not a suitable form of relief. However, that is a political view. Certainly no Labour Government since 1927 have taken that view. We are merely continuing to apply the arrangements, with a number of technical adjustments, but in substance the arrangements will remain as they have been for over 50 years.<br><br>
The only reason why legislation is needed now is because of a legal judgment last year which put the legal position into doubt. The Government felt that it was right to maintain the relief so that mergers for paper would be facilitated. But we have also maintained the quite proper provision that where a cash payment is involved—and this is not therefore a share acquisition by the shareholders of one company of another company—which comes out of the resources of the company making the takeover and goes as cash to the shareholders of the second company—stamp duty should be payable. There has not been any yield from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
that because no tax has been raised. It has been happening like this for over 50 years. The Government decided that it would be right to maintain that relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support everything that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) has said about the clause. I am worried about the way in which the provision has been brought forward. I have listened carefully to the Economic Secretary. The year 1984 was particularly bad—or good, depending on which way one looks at it—for mergers and takeovers. Some of the sums of money involved were extremely substantial. For example I think that nearly £1,000 million was involved in the BAT Industries bid for Eagle.<br><br>
First, are these types of mergers and takeovers that are taken into account under the clause? Secondly, I return to the important question which I suspect that, given the chance, the hon. Gentleman was going to ask. It concerns the costs involved. Finally, I cannot for the life of me understand why the stamp duty is taken on the basis of the place of the execution of the document. If I were BAT Industries and I were buying Eagle I would find a seedy cafe in Monte Carlo and execute the document there.—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I will rephrase that. I am far too Presbyterian a chap to do that, but I could if I so wished. I could repair to a seedy cafe in Monte Carlo where the stamp duty requirements are not nearly so onerous and thereby save myself several million pounds.<br><br>
I cannot understand why the Government do not consider making the condition on which stamp duty is attracted the basis of the shareholding of the acquiring party rather than having the locus of the execution of the contract as the determining factor.<br><br>
I am anxious about the clause and I hope that the hon. Member for Hodge Hill will press it to a Division, because I shall support him. I am sure that that will encourage him greatly. The costs are important; but I have never been able to understand fully the question of the locus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the earlier exchange between the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) and the Economic Secretary was most illuminating. It highlighted how arcane and archaic a tax stamp duty is. I am sorry that the Government have not taken the opportunity to reform it.<br><br>
There has been a comprehensive tax review and useful changes have been made. I am glad that some later clauses involve the abolition of some duties.<br><br>
Why do we have stamp duty? Is it to raise revenue? That seems to be a reasonable assumption. Most taxes are to raise revenue.<br><br>
The bulk of revenue raised by stamp duty comes from two basic transactions: the purchase and sale of houses and other property and the purchase and sale of shares in companies. Revenue from stamp duty has risen rapidly over the past two years partly because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: House prices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Great Grimsby has so helpfully told me from his usual sedentary position that the reason is because house prices have increased. The second reason is because of the rapid rise in the FT index. If that is so, and if the object of the exercise is principally to raise revenue, why do not we simplify
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0812">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
stamp duty by abolishing all the minor stamp duties and levying it simply on those two basic transactions? At the same time, why not make stamp duty a transaction-based duty rather than a duty on documents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite hear what the hon. Gentleman said. He was arguing that stamp duty should be restricted to two transactions. I heard him refer to the purchase of houses but I am not sure what the other transaction was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The other was basically the stock exchange transaction. I do not know the percentage, but a very high proportion of the totals revenue comes from those two basic transactions. I said that stamp duty could be simplified by abolishing all the other duties while making stamp duty a tax on transactions rather than a tax on instruments, which is the word used in the clause. Those two basic reforms would simplify matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me respond to a few points that have been made.<br><br>
I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) who obviously knows a lot of decent dives in Monte Carlo where he can conduct his business, but the date—not the place—when the documents are executed makes the difference. The stamp duty liability is determined by the regime in force on the date on which the transaction takes place. One cannot avoid liability by hopping across the Channel.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is right to say that stamp duty raises a great deal of revenue. It raises just over £1 billion. The overwhelming majority of that comes from property and from stocks and shares. It is an inefficient tax where it applies to most other areas. The package of measures in the Bill will reduce the number of documents that have to be stamped by several million, at a gross cost of about £14 million. It will enable about 250 staff to be redeployed on more useful activities. The gross cost is £14 million; the net cost is substantially lower, as it is an expensive tax to collect. The number of transactions is enormous, and many carry very small or nominal charges, so the tax is extremely inefficient for both the Revenue and the taxpayer.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
The net cost is about £10 million, and the change will save a substantial number of staff and reduce by about 40 per cent the number of documents handled.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hodge Hill would like to put obstacles in the way of mergers, and to do so involves a political decision. If the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends, and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) were to vote against the clause, they would be supporting something that no Government since 1927 have thought fit to impose—a charge to duty on exchanges of paper, share for share, in company mergers conducted in that way. That is certainly not the Government's intention. We believe that such a move would inhibit the market place and be a regressive step. It is something that no Government for two generations or longer have seen fit to impose.<br><br>
I commend the clause to the Committee, but does the hon. Member for Hodge Hill wish to intervene before I sit down?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one point I should like the Minister to clarify. If I take part in a merger and do the deal in a European country; if I get the document, the instrument, properly dealt with under the law of that country forth of the United Kingdom; if I go to the Court of Session in Scotland and am involved in a subsequent legal action, I can introduce the instrument perfectly properly. In the Court of Session it would be a probative document and I would not necessarily have to pay the levels of duty in clause 74.<br><br>
Am I right in that view? If so, it would be more sensible to make the duty attached to the share ownership the basis of the share ownership. That would guarantee that there was no loophole allowing people to go abroad, have a holiday, have a quick merger and then come back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fascinating insight into Liberal morals. Despite the frivolity, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is making a serious point.<br><br>
The liability to stamp duty arises from the registration of the document and not from its actual execution. It cannot be registered, and thereafter used, for purposes in this country unless the proper stamp duty has been paid. If the hon. Gentleman is thinking of the merger of two foreign companies which have no interest in the deal being established in this country, the merger could take place offshore. However, if the transfer is registered in the United Kingdom, allowing the hon. Gentleman to take his documents to the Court of Session, that is how the liability is crystallised. I am afraid that what the hon. Gentleman has described is not a way out of paying the duty in clause 74.<br><br>
I touched earlier on new clause 24, when we were talking, generally, of the way in which stamp duty works, and on the amendments to clause 74. New clause 24 includes provisions which would have been tabled as amendments to clauses 74 and 75 if stamp duty had been like any other tax. If it were possible to amend stamp duty with effect from the same date as the original clause, as if it were corporation tax or income tax, amendments to clauses 74 and 75 could have been tabled and we should have taken them as part of the selection of amendments to those clauses.<br><br>
The reason why the provisions are in the new clause, as I said to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), are that they are designed to start from 1 August, which is a new starting date. Therefore, they are not suitable as amendments to clauses 74 and 75, although they are mainly technical and would normally have been manageable as ordinary amendments. The major change in clause 24 extends the relief in clause 74 to cases where the shares of a company that acquires another are passed on to a third party by the shareholders of the second company. If that change were not included, the same transaction would be subject to double stamp duty, which has never been our intention.<br><br>
That is the only substantial change introduced by new clause 24. It affects clauses 74 and 75 and it is proper to point that out in the clause stand part debate. I would not want members of the Committee to feel that I was not being candid by leaving open such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would never accuse the Economic Secretary of being less than candid. We shall come to new clause 24 at the appropriate time.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0813">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
I cannot believe that liability to stamp duty is only a matter of date and is not affected by location. There must be a location which produces a liability. The Economic Secretary should look at his statement again.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) claimed that the Government had reviewed stamp duty. This part of the Bill cannot be described as a review. It looks to me more like piecemeal exemption. The exemptions may, of course, be justified and there may be some which I would support, but I do not regard the outcome as being a comprehensive review of stamp duty which is on a level with, for example, the review of VAT, which we discussed earlier in our proceedings.<br><br>
It is clear from earlier discussions and from the Economic Secretary's remarks that the time is long overdue for a thorough review of stamp duty. I am not sure whether I would agree or disagree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that stamp duty should be restricted to the two transaction which he suggests—I should want to think about the matter. Clearly, a review is necessary and I do not accept that a review has taken place on the basis of the provisions before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a review. I did not mean to suggest that the clauses constitute a review. Two or three years ago, the Inland Revenue published a consultative document on stamp duty which examined most aspects of it. Some of the recommendations in the clauses arise from that review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that information. I accept it in the spirit in which it was given. However, a much more comprehensive review is needed and we should not have our hands tied by an Act of 1694 in respect of this duty. I see that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield agrees with me on that matter, at least. It is nonsense that we are harking back to Acts which were passed nearly 300 years ago and pre-dated the Act of Union, as some of my hon. Friends and aspiring friends will, no doubt, point out. I always get the support of the alliance until Parliament is dissolved.<br><br>
I turn to the clause. The Economic Secretary seemed to confuse mergers with takeovers; I am convinced that the court has found that there is a difference between the two. The 1927 provisions cover mergers, but we are now discussing takeovers. I suspect that the legal decision—a copy of which the Minister will send me— concentrates on that point.<br><br>
Clearly, the Government plan to treat takeovers arranged by an exchange of shares differently from those financed by cash. The minister appeared to say that a takeover involving the transfer of cash will remain liable for stamp duty. Only what might be called paper takeovers—those made with a transfer of shares-will be exempt. But the effect of that distinction, put into law by the clause, will be to encourage takeovers by shares rather than by cash.<br><br>
I thought that the Government wanted fiscal neutrality, but this measure distinguishes between two types of takeover purely because of the way that they are financed. I do not think that we should follow the Minister into such fiscal bias. The Minister has not told us the estimated cost of his extra-statutory concession. I appreciate that he has no historic experience in this respect, but surely he has made such an estimate. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
shall not be put off by global estimates of £14 million in relation to millions of transactions; I do not believe that millions of takeovers are financed by shares. The treasury will have estimated the revenue accruing to it without the concession.<br><br>
We are discussing a political choice. The Minister agreed with that when he said that it was a matter of political judgment whether the Treasury should forgo the income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which would come from his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts his finger on the point. The Minister accused me of wanting to put an obstacle in the way of mergers, but surely he is not suggesting that stamp duty does that—that would be going a bit far. The Labour party does not in principle, oppose mergers—that would be silly. Indeed, we approve of some mergers, although of course we disapprove of others. Accusing us of carte blanche opposition to all mergers is daft. The difference between us is that the Minister does not want to put a tax on certain takeovers, while we do. That is why we shall press the matter to a Division.</span></p>

VOLUNTARY WINDING-UP: TRANSFER OF SHARES.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 75 seems similar to clause 74. It relates to takeovers when a company is being wound up and a second company takes over the subsidiary of the first. I shall be grateful if the Economic Secretary will explain the background to the clause, which I approach, as I am sure do many members of the Committee, with a degree of suspicion. All hon. Members have experience of liquidations in their constituencies, and we all know that many people lose from voluntary liquidations while few seem to profit from them. I ask the Economic Secretary to explain why the Government wish to remove the stamp duty on this type of transaction.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0814">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 74 does not provide relief in the case of a takeover of a subsidiary company where its parent is in voluntary liquidation. By definition, it applies only where there is an exchange of securities between the acquiring company and the shareholders of the company being taken over.<br><br>
Once a company's parent is in liquidation, the acquiring company's shares can only be issued to the liquidator or to the ultimate shareholders of the group. They cannot be issued to the shareholders of the company which is being acquired. For that technical reason, clause 74 would not cover the case of company A wanting to acquire company B which was the subsidiary of company C in liquidation, even though the liquidation might have the effect of putting company B's shares into the hands of the shareholders of company C. Because of the technical nature of that transaction, to put them on all fours with the provisions of clause 74, in those cases clause 75 enables the requirement that the shares have to be issued direct to the shareholders of the company being acquired. They are not operative in this case. It is purely because of the technicalities involved where there is a liquidation of a company which stands in between the company being acquired and its own shareholders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the job of the Economic Secretary to explain such technicalities to us. He identified the company being wound up as the parent company, which he described as company C. Therefore, company A seeks to acquire company B, which belongs to company C. We know that company C is being voluntarily wound up. Company A will issue shares to the liquidator of company C in return for acquisition of company B. But if company A pays cash for company B, there will still be a liability for stamp duty as I understand it. How does the Economic Secretary justify that distinction? I should have thought that if there were merit in saying that the people selling company B should receive a stamp duty exempt issue of shares, the same argument must apply if they receive cash instead. Why does the Economic Secretary wish to distinguish between a transaction for cash and a transaction for shares?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the same point as that raised by the hon. Gentleman at the end of our debate on clause 74, about drawing a distinction between cash and shares. There was a long discussion of that matter, but I did not respond because it was clear that the Committee was anxious to take the decision on whether clause 74 should stand part of the Bill. However, I am happy to deal with the point and to cover another aspect which the hon. Gentleman raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a long discussion but the Economic Secretary did not explain why he drew a distinction between cash and shares.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I should like to offer the Committee now.<br><br>
The acquisition of a company for shares does not give rise to capital gains tax for the shareholders of the company being acquired, as, for example, when a paper for paper offer is issued by company A to the shareholders of company B. If the shareholders of company B exchange their shares for those in company A, they do not pay capital gains tax until they dispose of the shares
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
in company A. If they have had an investment in company B, they continue that investment as they have not taken a decision to dispose of their holding. They have merely been given the opportunity to have shares in a larger company, which includes the company in which they previously had a direct investment. In line with the capital gains tax provisions we think that it is reasonable that stamp duty should not be charged on that transaction.<br><br>
If company A acquires the shares in company B for cash, or partly for cash, shareholders who elect to receive cash are making a cash disposal, just like asking a stockbroker to sell shares on the stock exchange. That will trigger capital gains tax. It is also appropriate that stamp duty should be paid on the transaction.<br><br>
With liquidation the same principles apply to cash. However, company C, the parent of company B, which is in voluntary liquidation, might well be aiming to dispose of the shares in company B direct to its own shareholders, when the assets of company C including the shares in company B, are distributed.<br><br>
That may be no cash transaction. Company C may be in liquidation for a completely different reason, and the shares in company B would become the property of the previous shareholders of company C. Therefore, the shareholders of company B have not initiated a cash transaction or a disposal of their shares; the intervening company has been removed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said that sometimes people suffered with liquidation. In a compulsory liquidations, the assets of company C, which would include the shares of company B, would probably be wanted for the benefit of creditors, not for shareholders, and these provisions would not apply in that case. They apply only in relation to voluntary liquidation, where the shareholders of company C decide for some reason that company C's existence is no longer needed, and the assets could be distributed direct to the shareholders.<br><br>
Under clause 74 it is a necessary condition of the relief that the shares must be issued by company A direct to the shareholders of company B. For this technical reason, the provision cannot operate in the case of a voluntary liquidation, which is why clause 75 provides this equivalent exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Economic Secretary say what happens where the assets in a voluntary liquidation are not enough to meet the company's liabilities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, it is likely to be a compulsory liquidation. A voluntary liquidation occurs with a company that is normally perfectly solvent, but where the company structure of the parent company is being removed and its assets passed directly to its shareholders. It does not normally create problems for creditors. If it did, it would be likely to be a compulsory liquidation, and one would have to have an administrator or receiver to act on behalf of the creditors.<br><br>
6 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary emphasise that "normally" does not mean "always"? It is possible in a voluntary liquidation that assets are not enough to cover liabilities. Will the Economic Secretary confirm that that is correct?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed possible to have a voluntary liquidation where the assets are not enough to cover the liabilities. Then, assets would go to the creditors and not to the shareholders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, if company A paid cash for company B, the Treasury would charge stamp duty. However, if company A gave shares to the liquidator winding up company A, stamp duty would not be charged. How does the Economic Secretary justify that distinction? The Government are taking a tax on proceeds that will be put into liquidation and which, by the definition in my example, are not enough to satisfy creditors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The creditors would not have a claim on shares in company B. They would have a cash claim on company C's assets, so there would have to be a conversion into cash for that purpose. Cash transactions are not exempted from stamp duty, so stamp duty would be involved in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Economic Secretary advise that stamp duty would be involved at the time of the conversion of the shares when the shares were sold for cash?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Let us discuss a voluntary liquidation where the assets will be enough to meet the liabilities to creditors. If company A pays cash for company B to its owner— company C—stamp duty will be charged. However, if company A issues shares to company C and those shares are distributed to the shareholders in company C, no stamp duty will be paid on any of those transactions.<br><br>
If, in the fullness of time, shareholders of company C sell their newly acquired shares in company A, they will be liable to capital gains tax and also to stamp duty at the point when the shares are sold. Does the Economic Secretary mean that the exemption will not cause any loss of revenue from stamp duty but that the time the tax is charged will be different? Therefore, does he mean that there is no cost, although there may be a cash flow difference? Is this another extra strategy concession that we are putting right 12 months later?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. This is not something that we are putting right 12 months later. We are making a logical extension to the principle of clause 74 to apply to the substance of a voluntary liquidation. It is unlikely to happen often, but there is no good reason why a voluntary liquidation should be influenced by having a charge to this stamp duty that would not happen if the parent company did not intervene. It might distort for no good reason the way in which a transaction was carried out.<br><br>
Stamp duty would be payable on the ultimate disposal of the shares in the same way as in an ordinary merger or acquisition. When shareholders in company C got their shares in company A, instead of their shares in company B, they would be liable to capital gains tax and stamp duty when they sold their shares in the ordinary way.</span></p>

GIFTS INTER VIVOS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 77, line 41, leave out subsection (2).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 248, in page 78, line 121, leave out subsection (4).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Lamont, have asked us to discuss amendment No. 248 in the same debate. I accept your decision but, to my mind at least, there is a difference between these two subsections.<br><br>
Subsection (2) deals with the valuation of a property given between living people—I prefer the English expression to the Latin—whereas subsection (4) seems to involve local constituency associations. My constituency party receives gifts from time to time and I do not think that we have ever been liable to stamp duty on them. It may be different in other political parties. The Economic Secretary might like to explain this subsection also.<br><br>
I am especially interested in subsection (2). We are well aware that there is a system of avoiding capital transfer tax by making gifts during the life time of the donor and donee. The gifts can be made either directly or through a trust. The clause would reduce the stamp duty on such gifts. I shall not anticipate a clause stand part debate, but we are naturally concerned about valuation. I shall be grateful for an explanation of that detailed point before we move on to the principle of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) is right to point out that subsections (2) and (4) apply to separate aspects of the tidying up arrangements for the general provision of the clause, which is to abolish the 1 per cent duty on gifts.<br><br>
Subsection (2) makes a minor consequential amendment to section 58(7) of the Stamp Act 1891. That is the major Act in which many of the stamp duties are embodied. The subsection deals with what are known as sub-sales of property. It provides for the value of property that is sub-sold to be determined by reference to the value that would apply to the duty on gifts—that is, the price that it would fetch on the open market. A sub-sale is a technical expression for what I would call an on sale. The property is tranferred from A to B and from B to C as part of the same transaction, so that the eventual transfer is from A to C. By introducing various intervening stages it may be possible to have a transaction of which the cash value is substantially less than the market value—for example, if it is a property on which a lease is granted as part of the arrangement.<br><br>
We seek to ensure that in such circumstances only one lot of stamp duty is charged, but that it is on the full market value of the transaction. In other words, the substance of the series of transactions should be recognised rather than the form. Although the form might involve stamp duty on more than one occasion, it also might involve it on a much lower figure. That could be used as a means of avoidance.<br><br>
Subsection (2) is necessary, following the repeal of the duty on gifts in clause 76, because the definition will no longer exist. The removal of the duty on gifts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0816">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
means that the value of a property that is sub-sold cannot be determined by the value that applies to the duty on gifts. Technically, we must provide a new definition of value following the repeal of the duty on gifts. It is merely a substitution. The subsection provides an indentical definition, but without reference to the duty on gifts.<br><br>
Subsection (4) repeals the exemption from the duty on gifts provided by section 15 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1983 for transfer of property from one constituency association to another when the transfer results from parliamentary boundary changes. For technical reasons, the new constituency Labour party or Conservative association will not be identical to the one that previously covered the area. If it were not for the relief provided in the 1983 Act, transfers from one association to another could technically give rise to a tax on gifts, because they are a voluntary transfer of property from one legal person to another. That was not intended in the last boundary changes, and the Act exempted such transfers. But if the transfer on gifts is removed the exemption is no longer necessary, and that is what subsection (4) does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 76(2) appears to be unique in part III of the Bill. It seems to be protecting the Revenue rather than giving money away. On that basis, I welcome it.<br><br>
Although I understand the logic of subsection (4), I am not sure at what point a local constituency association would become liable for the tax. I cannot believe that any constituency Labour party to which a duplicating machine was transferred by another would be liable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The stamp duty on gifts applies essentially to property and investments. It is possible that a constituency association might have a capital interest in an office block. If it owned its premises, the transfer of those premises to the new association might technically give rise to the duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that we have established that we are talking about shares and office blocks I think we are all clear about which constituency associations we are discussing. I do not know of a constituency Labour party that owns an office block, and I have yet to meet one that owns any shares. But I am not here to pursue a vendetta against the Conservative party. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in this clause, which, as I said earlier, abolishes the stamp duty on gifts between living people. This Government have progressively reduced the cost of avoiding capital transfer tax. When they took office, they found that lifetime gifts presented a problem because they were subject to both capital gains tax and stamp duty. In 1980 they removed the capital gains tax disincentive by introducing the holdover relief for gifts, which meant that any charge to capital gains tax was deferred until the recipient disposed of the asset, if ever. Subsequent Finance Acts extended that concession. The 1981 Act extended the relief to gifts from individuals to settlements; the 1982 Act exempted gifts from settlements
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
to individuals—that is, the capital distribution from settlements.<br><br>
Having progressively dismantled capital transfer tax, the Government are now abolishing the stamp duty on such gifts as well. Will the Economic Secretary tell us how much the Revenue will lose as a result of the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cost of the 1 per cent duty on gifts is estimated to be about £9 million gross in the coming year, although that figure may be reduced by about £3 million, which represents the present cost of collection.<br><br>
The duty on gifts was designed in 1910 to prevent people from disposing of property during their lifetime in anticipation of avoiding estate duty. However, the duty an gifts has been superseded in recent years by the protective period of three years applied to estate duty and capital transfer tax rates on death, and by the application of capital transfer tax to transfers between living persons—or inter vivos, to put it in technical terms.<br><br>
As it stands, the duty on gifts is onerous both for the Revenue and for the individuals concerned. Its abolition will save about 190 staff whose services can then be employed more usefully by the Revenue. It will also save much time and effort spent on valuations. Where a transfer is subject to the duty, independent valuations may be necessary. Many of the transfers involving the duty on gifts are transfers between husband and wife. No capital transfer tax is payable on such transfers and it is therefore unnecessary to have a valuation of property for CTT purposes. But because of the 1 per cent duty on gifts it is necessary for the taxpayer to have a valuation and for the Revenue to establish that that valuation is correct.<br><br>
Capital transfer tax deals with voluntary transfers and there is therefore little case for having the 1 per cent duty on gifts on top of that. It produces a very low yield and high compliance costs and is often payable where capital transfer tax does not apply anyway—for example, in the case that I have mentioned of transfers between spouses. The duty constitutes a laborious way of generating a limited amount of income, and that is why we propose its abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regard the clause as another example of the Conservative Government giving yet more money to those who do not need it at the expense of those who do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is becoming rather noisy and I am having difficulty in hearing even those hon. Members who are quite close.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me bring the measure into perspective by reviewing some of the changes that have been made in past Finance Acts. The Committee will remember that the 1981 Act changed the provisions relating to capital transfer tax and the taxation of gifts in several ways. For example, it ended lifetime accumulation the main conceptual difference between estate and CTT— and limited the period over which the amount of transfers is totalled to ten years. So in 1981 we saw the first step in the Government's plan to make things easier for people who have so much money that they run into trouble if they have to give it to their offspring or friends. Of course, there are not many such people.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
Most people do not have to worry about capital transfer tax. In Finance Bill Committees, however, we spend most of our time talking about the people who have all that money. For me, as a Labour Member, it is a waste of time debating such a small section of society.<br><br>
The 1981 Budget did more: for lifetime transfers, the top rates of tax were reduced to two thirds of the death rates, and the annual exemption was increased to £3,000. It did more: the previous asset ceiling of £250,000 for the payment of tax by interest-free instalments was removed. It did more: the concession was extended to agricultural landlords, who also achieved a 20 per cent valuation relief.<br><br>
The financial statement quantified the cost of those changes at £20 million. However, the cost of limiting cumulation to ten years could not be estimated at the time. The right honourable and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) introduced the changes on 11 March, and I quote his words:
<br><blockquote><p>"In a year in which we can give no income tax relief, I cannot make major changes in capital taxation."—[<i>Official Report</i>, 11 March 1981; Vol. 1000, c. 779.]</p></blockquote>
The right honourable and learned Gentleman did not see the changes as major changes, but I do.<br><br>
This clause gives a little more to a certain small section of society, in that it abolishes the stamp duty on gifts inter vivos.<br><br>
Let us see what the 1982 Budget did. The scale thresholds were raised, the bands were widened, and subsequent indexation was introduced. The taxation of discretionary trusts was restructured. The tax-free transfer to charities within one year of death was raised to £250,000. The cost of that was put at £91 million, excluding the subsequent indexing. The right honourable and learned Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I turn now to a part of our tax system which is impeding the efficient working of capital markets and doing injustice to individuals and businesses alike: the capital taxes. There is room for wide differences of view about the principle of taxing capital. But there is no case whatever for maintaining a system of capital taxes which, by holding back business success and penalising personal endeavour, does serious economic and social damage".—[<i>Official Report</i>, 10 March 1982; Vol. 19, c. 754.]</p></blockquote>
Yet a small section of society got richer at the expense of a much larger and poorer section of society.<br><br>
Then we come to the 1983 Budget. The thresholds and bands were more than indexed. Valuation reliefs were increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent for minority holdings in unquoted companies and for agricultural landlords. The period for paying interest-free instalments was extended from eight years to ten years. Transfers to charities became tax free without limit. The cost was put at £63 million. The then Chancellor said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am concerned that the prospect of capital transfer tax may still discourage those who are contemplating investing capital in small businesses. It may also be one of the factors reducing the number of farms available for letting."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 16 March 1983; Vol. 39, c. 152.]</p></blockquote>
A small section of society prospered and got even more untold wealth, without having to work for it. It was simply given to them. Such wealth is not created out of thin air. We cannot wave a magic wand and pass wealth over to the rich people who do not need it. There is a finite amount of wealth that can be created, and if it passes to people who already have too much of it, the people living in poverty are driven to further depths of privation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
That brings us to the 1984 Budget. In addition to indexation, three of the top rate bands were abolished for both death and life transfers. For lifetime transfers, the scale rates were further reduced so as to be uniformly half the death rates. The cost was put at £49 million. This time it was the right honourable Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unnecessarily high rates of tax discourage enterprise and risk taking. This is true of the capital taxes, just as it is of the corporation and income taxes. It is a matter of particular concern to those involved in running unquoted family businesses … I propose therefore … to reduce the highest rate of capital transfer tax from 75 per cent to 60 per cent."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 March 1984; Vol.56, c.299.]</p></blockquote>
That is what he said.<br><br>
However, I shall not dwell on that because, given the composition of the Government, I am wasting my time. But by a long series of actions the Government have taken a substantial amount of wealth from the country and given it to people who do not need it or, at least, made it possible for those people to pass it on without paying a proper form of taxation. Having done that, the Government now tell us that there is no point in paying stamp duty on it, either.<br><br>
How blatant can a Government get in shifting and redistributing wealth? They take it not from those who have it but from those who do not. Therefore, those who are not wealthy have even less and those who are already wealthy receive more. I find that disgusting, and I shall vote against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary told us that the cost of the change would be £9 million gross in a year. He also told us that the estimated cost of collection was 40 per cent of that figure. That means that the net benefit to the revenue from this stamp duty is slightly over £5 million.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary told us that the abolition of this stamp duty would redeploy 190 Inland Revenue staff more usefully. The cost of those 190 people is included in the figure of 40 per cent, which he had previously taken into account. Also, there is no shortage of staff and, whereas I can understand him making the point that this would release 190 people who could be redeployed to more useful measures by the Inland Revenue, if there were a dearth of people employed by it, the current level of unemployment should make it easy for the Inland Revenue to recruit. Therefore, unless the Economic Secretary is pretending that those people are so skilled that they cannot be easily replaced, that point is bogus.<br><br>
We are told by the Economic Secretary that that £9 million gross and £5 million net is a low-yield tax. We now have further definitions because we have heard that "negligible" is less than £1 million, "slight" is £2 million and now "low yield" is £5 million.<br><br>
I find the vocabulary of the Economic Secretary and his hon. Friends in the Treasury fascinating, and I shall remind them of those expressions when we debate other clauses. I shall particularly commend that language to my hon. Friends when we discuss the revenue to accrue to the Treasury from taxing employers' contributions to workplace nurseries, which will be nowhere near £5 million. Indeed, the measures also taken by the Government to tax tips received by postmen will be nowhere near £5 million. It is clear that political decisions are being taken by the Treasury in the choice of taxes to be abolished or not collected.<br><br>

I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) for reminding us what the Government have done to reduce revenue from capital transfer tax. My hon. Friend must have read the excellent article written by Mr. Alister Sutherland in the journal <i>Fiscal Studies</i> last year. He explained this in detail and quantified the effect of the Government's measures.<br><br>
I do not believe that the Economic Secretary will pretend that stamp duty of 1 per cent is what he described in a different context about takeovers as an obstacle for these gifts between living people. People are using those gifts as a means of avoiding capital transfer tax, or what is left of it under this Government, and now the Economic Secretary is to give them an extra gift by a reduction of 1 per cent in stamp duty.<br><br>
I regard such gifts to avoid capital transfer tax as a tax dodge. The Economic Secretary is proposing to abolish a tax on a tax dodge.</span></p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to a few of the matters that have been raised.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) listed changes that we have made to capital transfer tax, which works much better as a result. The appalling rate of 75 per cent in particular—the top rate on lifetime transfers, which we inherited—stopped most transfers taking place.<br><br>
The yield from capital transfer tax and estate duty— the two have to be taken together—is higher than it was when we came into office. The argument that we have reduced the yield and given a lot of money away is absolutely wrong. Because more transactions are taking place, the yield is rising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is fallacious reasoning. The Minister said previously that the money being transferred had dried up—presumably in anticipation of a Conservative victory—but if there were, say, 20 or 30 years of Labour Government, the transactions would have to have taken place, willy nilly. The Minister has not made a proper comparison. The yield from the tax may now be a lot higher, but that is not because it is a better tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enter into a long statistical debate on the subject, which would be fruitless. The point is that we have made changes to the tax, and under the present Government, the yield from it has risen. That supports my argument that, because the market has been freed by the changes, many more transactions have taken place.<br><br>
The Opposition are tilting at the wrong target. It is perfectly reasonable of them to disagree with the Government about the structure and rates of capital transfer tax. I do not quarrel with their putting a different view. We have a different opinion about the consequences.<br><br>
Gifts duty is the wrong target. The Labour Government themselves exempted transfers between husband and wife from capital transfer tax, yet the gifts duty applies to such transfers. On a transfer, any property has to be valued to establish whether stamp duty is payable; the present threshold is £30,000. That may involve all the expense of valuations both by the taxpayers and the Inland Revenue to see whether the property falls just one side or other of the stamp duty boundary.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
There may be a lot of cost and no yield at all in some cases. That is why I said that it is a low yield tax. I was commenting not on the size of the yield, but on the ratio. A 60 per cent yield from 100 per cent gross takings is a very low yield. A cost of 40 per cent to gather it is very high, far higher than for almost any other tax.<br><br>
The capital transfer tax regime is the wrong target for the Opposition's complaints. I understand that they see that there is a relationship between the two taxes, but I am saying that the duty on gifts is now applicable substantially to people who are not liable to capital transfer tax.<br><br>
The 1 per cent duty on its own, which was designed to protect the higher rate charge on death—on estate duty or capital transfer tax—is no longer needed when there is a tax on gifts during lifetime. Because it is an extremely inefficient tax, which causes a lot of bother to taxpayers and the Inland Revenue and has a low yield ratio, it is a very good candidate for abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave some figures about the increasing revenue from capital tranfer tax, which I did not catch, because he went through them quite quickly. Would he repeat them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>; I was referring to capital transfer tax and estate duty. The expected forecast yield for 1985–86 is £760 million as against £700 million in 1979–80.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has chosen his statistics carefully because there were reductions in 1978–79 and 1979–80, no doubt, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said, in anticipation of a Consevative Government. At current prices, the yield from estate duty and capital transfer tax was more than £760 million during the years 1975–76, 1976–77 and 1977–78.

The Economic Secretary will be relieved to know that we welcome the clause. The Opposition support the Government's suggestion that stamp duty should be abolished on gifts between spouses and former spouses on the breakdown or dissolution of a marriage. It is entirely proper that the Government should not impose a tax on arrangements made by those who are going through the trauma of divorce or separation.<br><br>
Will the Economic Secretary explain why the exemption will apply only if people go to the expense of going to court to arrange for their separation? Why is his sympathy restricted to those who go to court?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has welcomed the clause on behalf of the Opposition. The amendment refers to the word "judicial" in the term "judicial separation" in subsection (l)(<i>c</i>). Omitting the word "judicial" would widen the scope of the clause by extending the relief provided to cases where couples agreed to separate without the formality of a court order. However, the clause is designed to provide relief only where the legal status of a marriage is altered. It is only in those circumstances, and then only rarely, that stamp duty problems have arisen. The problems have arisen from the form the court order takes. If there is no court order, there is no problem. Where a couple are not under the constraint of a court order, there is no reason for the exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a perfect answer to my probing question. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I have already said that the Opposition welcome the clause, I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would give an estimate of the loss to the Revenue. I am sure that the Economic Secretary will appreciate the reason for that request.<br><br>
Many members of the Committee will recall that, during the debates in Committee a year ago, we were told by the Economic Secretary or the Minister of State that a problem had arisen during the previous year. Moreover, that Treasury Minister blamed the Opposition for not having probed the clause adequately because the Opposition had allowed it to go through on the nod. Therefore, this year—a year in which the Bill contains so many complicated changes in stamp duty—we must probe at every opportunity and on every change. I therefore ask the Economic Secretary to tell us exactly how much the clause will cost the Revenue.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cost of the exemption is negligible, as most transfers of property on the breakup of a marriage are exempt from ad valorem duty under another provision, notably clause 76. The main purpose of this clause is to make it clear that there is no charge without having to test whether there is an exemption under any other provision. So although an odd case may fall under this clause rather than under clause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
76, which is the basic provision that will cover most transactions, there is an advantage in having a specific measure, quite apart from any other case, because it removes the uncertainty and enables couples about to break up to go ahead without being inhibited by worrying about liability to stamp duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As uncertainty gives opportunities to lawyers, and as I am anxious not to give lawyers any more opportunities, I am delighted to hear the Economic Secretary's explanation.</span></p>

DEATH: VARYING DISPOSITIONS, AND APPROPRIATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We understand that the clause abolishes stamp duty on a deed of family arrangement. I also understand that the deeds are used by people who want to rewrite the will of a deceased person. I am told that that is often done to split up an estate in such a way that capital transfer tax will be saved by those who will benefit from the will.<br><br>
The beneficiaries under a will take it upon themselves to alter the express written wishes of someone who has died and to dispose of that person's property in a way that is different from the way the deceased person wished. I regard that with suspicion under any circumstances, and I am not clear why the Government want to abolish the stamp duty levied in such cases. We all understand why people want to rewrite wills; it is to avoid tax. They are avoiding tax liability and at present there is a small obstacle of stamp duty levied on that deed of family arrangement. Why does the Econoimic Secretary want to abolish a tax on a tax dodge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong to describe the arrangements as a tax dodge. It has been generally accepted for a long time that there is a case for allowing, within a limited period—it is two years from death in the case of other taxes—an ability to rearrange, by mutual agreement among the beneficiaries of a will, the individual component parts of an estate.<br><br>
The rearrangement of assets of that kind is exempt from capital transfer tax. Indeed, it was a Labour Government who introduced that provision, so they must accept the principle that it is not like ordinary disposals. There is a disposal between the deceased and the beneficiary but, as it passes through the estate, it is not quite like a separate form of ownership.<br><br>
The clause provides an exemption for deeds of family arrangement and similar instruments. Since capital transfer tax and capital gains tax reliefs were introduced in respect of such arrangements, there has been a case for comparable stamp duty exemption. Following the repeal of the duty on gifts, stamp duty would arise only in exceptional circumstances on such transactions. It would be difficult to predict, depending on the nature of the assets and any cash or other types of assets held in the estate, whether any liability was likely to arise. In most cases clauses 76 would deal with the problem,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0820">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 539</span>
but, as in the case of clause 77, it is possible that some cases that are not liable for capital transfer tax might technically come within the provision of voluntary dispositions on death. It seems unnecessary to keep the duty in place with a negligible yield. Not only does it create much uncertainty but great costs are involved in valuing all the component items of each transaction to establish the level of stamp duty if it is payable.<br><br>
The yield without a 1 per cent duty on gifts would be negligible, and the great deal of extra expense for the Inland Revenue as well as for the trustees makes a good case for doing away with it at the same time as we are abolishing the duty on gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary points out that these deeds of family arrangement are drawn up by mutual agreement between the beneficiaries. I must repeat that there is one person who does not agree and whom it is impossible to ask, namely the deceased person who has described his or her wishes in a will. The deed of family arrangement varies the terms of a will. I accept what the Economic Secretary says about this tax loophole having been introduced by a Labour Government. But it is always possible that loopholes that were created by Labour Governments were not seen as loopholes at the time but have subsequently become loopholes. I would certainly not consider my hands tied by a decision that was taken by a former Labour Government. We regard this loophole with a great deal of suspicion.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary says that it is difficult to predict whether a deed of family arrangement would incur stamp duty. But the beneficiaries can always consult the Inland Revenue and ask for an adjudication. A genuine deed of family arrangement simply to arrange that one person has the benefit of some much treasured possession which has been in the family for some time is not made for tax reasons. However, we are suspicious that this is being used as a loophole and exploited by people who are simply avoiding their obligations to capital transfer tax.<br><br>
In a different debate, the Economic Secretary described stamp duty as an obstacle. We want to put obstacles in the way of people who are exploiting these tax loopholes. I accept that they may be negligible in number, but it is part and parcel of the Government's approach to capital transfer tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman's comments about the reliefs for capital transfer tax and capital gains tax in this context. They were introduced by a Labour Administration and he now says he has serious doubts about them. Clearly the principle did not come about as a loophole; it was deliberately introduced at that time. I do not remember whether you, Mr. Lamond, were in the Chair in those days. I was certainly a member of the Finance Bill committee at that time. These provisions were considered by all members of the Committee to be perfectly reasonable reliefs. That the hon. Gentleman should now cast doubt on a relief of a much more limited kind—the benefit of which is for the most part the avoidance of uncertainty—strikes me as rather odd. That observation ought to be put on the record before the Committee proceeds further.</span></p>

REPEAL OF CERTAIN FIXED DUTIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause paves the way for schedule 21.

We are content to allow the clause to go through without any further debate, but we shall have comments to make on the individual stamp duties which are specified in schedule 21.</span></p>

STAMP DUTY: HEADINGS OMITTED</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had representations about my provisional selection of amendments to the schedule suggesting that it would be more convenient if, instead of taking them all together from amendment No. 253 to amendment No. 266, we discussed them individually. I have agreed to that. Therefore the first amendment to the schedule, amendment No. 253, now stands alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 178, leave out lines 41 and 42.<br><br>
The amendment relates to the first of the miscellaneous stamp duties to be abolished by the Government; we shall be asking similar questions about each. Will the Economic Secretary explain exactly what is involved in that duty and the revenue that will be lost by its abolition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As there is a stream of amendments to the schedule, I should like first to say something about its contents. Most of the fixed duties have outlived their usefulness and should be abolished. They have mostly remained unchanged since 1870 and no longer earn their keep. The Committee may be amused to learn that the exception is the duty on an agreement "pursuant to the Highways Acts", which was increased from 6 old pence—or 2½p—to 5p in 1970. Often, the compliance cost exceeds the duty payable, especially when practitioners's costs are taken into account. There was widespread support for our proposals among representative bodies and others who responded to our consultative document.<br><br>
The abolition of the fixed duties is a useful contribution to the objective of achieving the maximum reduction in the number of documents requiring stamping, at a minimum cost; about 500,000 documents will no longer have to be stamped. The removal of these out-of-date duties helps to modernise the stamp duty system and is a useful simplification.<br><br>
Amendment No. 253 would retain the heading:
<br><blockquote><p>"Agreement or contract made or entered into pursuant to the Highways Acts."</p></blockquote>
That head of charge was introduced in 1870 to prevent such agreements being liable to deed duty which then stood at 35 shillings, or £1.75. Introduced at 6 old pence, it was doubled in 1970 to 5p in preparation for decimalisation. Now that the duty on deeds is to go, there is no need for what is in effect a reduced duty for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
the same agreements. At 5p, the cost of compliance exceeds the yield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 254, in page 178, leave out lines 43 and 44.<br><br>
Like the previous amendment, this is a probing amendment. We should like an explanation of the proposed change from the Minister, especially in view of last year's comments about our predecessors' not having done their job properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the comment mentioned by the hon. Gentleman must have been made before last year. I recall that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) was always quoting it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The comment was made last year. I well remember my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) referring to it frequently throughout our long Committee sittings then, as he had been provoked early in our deliberations. We have not forgotten that expression, which was used by Treasury Ministers, and we are determined that none of our successors will be teased in the same way—by making sure that we do our duty this year.</span></p>

<p>7 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I would do is to accuse the hon. Gentleman of failing to do his duty.<br><br>
Schedule 21(6) refers to the heading;
<br><blockquote><p>"Appointment of a new trustee, and appointment in execution of a power of attorney."</p></blockquote>
In addition to charging a 50p duty whenever there is a change in composition of a body of trustees, that head also catches the appointment in execution of a power under a will or settlement by trustees in favour of a beneficiary. The exemption applies only to the appointment of trustees. Transfers of property from the old to the new trustees remain dutiable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I to understand that the appointment of a trustee will not incur stamp duty in future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</span></p>
