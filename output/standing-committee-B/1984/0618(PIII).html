Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) who asked about costs. She appreciated that it was difficult to make a reliable estimate of the volume of bond issues, which is hard to forecast. Such bonds would obviously be particularly to high rate taxpayers, and businesses would no doubt be keen to take advantage of their interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with a modest assumption about the level of bond issues—about 5 per cent—the annual cost could exceed £100 million. That is the sort of figure that we should bear in mind in considering this issue on the modest estimate of take-up. Although I appreciated how my hon. Friend moved the new clause, and although I am sure that we all share his desire for more jobs to be created, I must advise the Committee not to accept the clause, and I hope that my hon. Friend will seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The account in the 	<i>Investors' Chronicle</i> more accurately represents my interview with the only journalist to whom I spoke, when I said that my view was the Treasury had not made up its mind.

	<div class='title'>CAPITAL GAINS TAX ROLL-OVER RELIEF WHERE PROCEEDS OF SALE OF LAND APPLIED IN REDUCING BUSINESS DEBTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) If the consideration which a person carrying on a trade obtains for the disposal of, or of his interest in, assets (in this section referred to as the 'old assets') used and used only for the purposes of the trade is applied by him in repaying a loan or loans in respect of which their interest is deductible in computing the profit charged to income tax under Schedule D Case I as being an expense incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, and the old assets are within the classes specified in section 118 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 then the person carrying on the trade shall, on making a claim, as respects the consideration when has been so applied, be treated for the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979—

	<p>FISHING VESSELS—ROLL-OVER RELIEF</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hirst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be the last occasion on which I shall try to persuade my right hon. and honourable Friends on the Front Bench to accept amendments and new clauses. Perhaps I could follow the agreeable precedent of my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) and say what a pleasure it has been, Miss Fookes, to see you presiding with your usual charm, dignity, good humour and, on occasions, firmness, over our proceedings over the past few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many businesses require to restructure their finances in order to take account of industrial and economic changes, in some cases by continuing with high real rates of interest. The purpose of new clause 8 is to enable businesses, especially agricultural businesses which are heavily in debt, to respond to the pressures when it is economically sensible to do so, by being able to sell assets in order to reduce debts without suffering the capital gains tax penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Roll-over relief already exists to ensure that the capital raised from the sale of business assets and redeployed within the business by the purchase of new assets is provided so that a business can survive and prosper. However, it is just as important for a businessman to ensure that his business debt is at a level which can reasonably be financed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of debt of many farmers, and traders in some other industries, has become excessive in recent years. Probably the only solution to protect and preserve the businesses will be to sell off assets in order to reduce the debts and, hopefully, be left with a more viable, though smaller, business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the capital gains tax may not be rolled over unless the proceeds are reinvested in new capital assets. The fact that the business disposing of assets in those circumstances may have to pay capital gains tax could threaten its future viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 8 would enable a business, whether agricultural or not, to realise part of the assets and devote the proceeds to reducing the debts, without experiencing the cash flow disadvantage of having to part with capital gains tax on sale. This is not a relief of capital gains tax, but merely a postponement until the remaining assets of the business are sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>641</span>
I can illustrate the need for the clause especially well in relation to agriculture, although it has equal application in other industries where the general level of debt gives rise to concern. The majority of agricultural businesses are small family businesses. Between 1970 and 1984 farm incomes fell in real terms by some 36 per cent. In recent years the proportion of farm income which has been taken by interest payment has risen by 15 per cent to 32 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the immediate past quotas on milk producers and other changes in agriculture have not made matters any easier. The future requirements of agriculture to pay attention to environmental and conservation requirements make it unwise to assume that the trend in debt and interest payments will be reversed, except perhaps by a partial disposal of the assets of a business which would, of course, be subject to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for roll-over relief was recognised by the previous Labour Government when they extended capital gains tax, and it has been continued by the Conservative Governments. I believe that new clause 8 will particularly help small businesses to make investment decisions based on market and economic criteria rather than on fiscal considerations. I therefore hope that it will recommend itself to my right honourable Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 17, which is supported by a number of my fellow Scottish hon. Members and is particularly supported by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, aims to deal with the rather special position relating to rollover on depreciating assets. The fact that it refers to fishing vessels is perhaps a slight misnomer. The clause, as it is worded, could relate to all vessels although perhaps I shall say something shortly about the status of fishing vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that many members of the Committee will be aware of the considerable concern in the Scottish fishing industry about the drop in catches in recent years, the drop in income of fishermen and the problems that many of them face in getting started in the industry and being able to replace their fishing boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a normal basis, chargeable gains will arise on the sale of fishing boats and other shipping assets but those chargeable gains may be postponed by roll-over relief for a maximum of ten years with the tax liability crystallising at the end of that period, perhaps at a time when there are no other sale proceeds available to meet the liability. Fishing vessels are typically the only valuable assets of the fishing business. The significant costs of a vessel dictate that a new business is only able to start off by buying an older vessel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present provisions in sections 115–117 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 are considered to be a strong deterrent to such new businesses which want to move gradually to more modern and expensive craft as trading conditions and the funds of their business permit. I have acknowledged that the wording of new clause 17 goes rather wider than fishing vessels, which is the category of assets which I seek to assist in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, and my right honourable Friend is sympathetic to the points that I am making about helping the fishing industry, it would be easy to restrict the relief to fishing vessels by referring to those vessels which have a number allocated to them under the Merchant Shipping Fishing Boats Registry Order 1927
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>642</span>
in conjunction with the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. In view of the serious predicament of fishing in Scotland and the fact that the new clause is supported by a number of my hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies, I hope that my right honourable Friend will be able to make a sympathetic gesture towards the plight of the fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to make one or two comments on the two new clauses. First, we need to know the potential costs of extending roll-over relief as suggested in new clause 8. Secondly, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) referred specifically to farmers and small businesses in justifying his request for further relief from capital gains tax. The new clause is not restricted in that way. It has the further problem that it might make it possible to sell land. No matter what business one is in, one may own land that could be sold to get the capital gains tax roll-over relief. Or one could sell the property concerned, which one might still need to use, to a pension fund, for example, and then lease it back and so have its continued use. That could be done solely for the purpose of obtaining tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members see no reason for the introduction of the new clause. Its aim is to extend relief to a situation where half the business is sold to bail out the other half. There is no logic in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are more sympathetic in their approach to new clause 17. It allows the full capital gains tax roll-over relief to be claimed where an owner sells one ship and reinvests in another. The hon. Gentleman justified that by reference to the state of the fishing industry. It is well known that the Opposition have frequently raised the problems of the fishing industry and have assigned various causes—mainly arising from the Common Market fishing policy—to those problems. We would be prepared to look at the hon. Gentleman's new clause sympathetically, even if it were widened to include all ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have referred to the state of the British shipping industry. Ideally, I should like such relief to be confined to occasions on which British ships were purchased and sailed under the British flag, but we understand that it is not possible to lay down such restrictions, because that would conflict with GATT and could possibly bring problems of retaliation. We should love to have a new clause that was designed to confine roll-over relief in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are much more sympathetic towards the purposes of new clause 17, which states specifically that reinvestment must take place in another vessel to be used for the business purposes of the owner in question. We shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it and, of course, we want to know what the costs will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond first to new clause 8 and to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock asked about the cost. The best advice that I have is that the cost cannot be estimated because the clause goes fairly wide. That was acknowledged by my hon. Friend and by the hon. Lady. The new clause seeks to defer the capital gains tax due when the proceeds from the sale of business
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>643</span>
assets are used to repay debts of the business. It provides for a deferral of the tax until a subsequent disposal of the remaining assets of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is based upon the present capital gains tax relief which defers the charge when certain business assets—for example, land and buildings used for trading purposes, and fixed plant and machinery— are replaced. Although the title of new clause 8 refers to sales of land, the new clause is drafted in wider terms and would extend to proceeds from the disposal of all assets which qualify for relief under the existing provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise the importance of the small business sector, and as my hon. Friend would, I am sure, be the first to acknowledge, have introduced many measures to help businesses to expand and to obtain investment capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made it clear that the new clause is primarily directed towards the agricultural sector, although as drafted it goes wider. Two existing reliefs may be applicable: the first is the roll-over relief when business assets are replaced; secondly, where a small amount of land is sold, any gain can be rolled over against the cost of the land which is retained. Where that applies, it does not matter what the proceeds are used for, and the limits upon that small relief are 5 per cent of the total amount of land, with £20,000 as the maximum sum involved. That maximum was increased from £10,000 last year and is an important additional relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are certainly sympathetic to those facing a capital gains liability arising from the need to sell business assets to reduce outstanding loans. We are doubtful, however, about new clause 8. The whole purpose of the general roll-over relief on which the proposed relief is based is to allow traders to replace business assets without incurring a capital gains tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the concept of replacement is dropped, it could be argued that relief should be available in all circumstances. My hon. Friend argued that relief should be available when debt is being paid off, and I am sure that ingenious minds would quickly come forward with other proposals if we were to depart from the principle of the replacement of business assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the relief were to be extended in that way to cover the repayment of debt or the payment of wages, and other charges arising, it would be tantamount to exempting businesses from capital gains tax altogether. Without specific provisions it would be very difficult to ensure that the relief which my hon. Friend has in mind would be provided by the new clause only in the genuine cases which he is seeking to relieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I must tell my hon. Friend that his new clause is not acceptable. We have had discussions with the Country Landowners Association and I am sure further discussions could be held if wanted. We would look carefully at any other proposal. I accept that at times when interest rates are high and there are particular difficulties for small firms and small farms we must show sympathy towards the person who is seeking to get his business into a proper, healthy financial state by selling some of the assets and in doing so incurs a capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>644</span>
Having expressed that sympathy and my understanding of the case, I must still tell my hon. Friend that I do not think that his new clause is acceptable, although we are prepared to have further talks and discussions on the question, and it may be possible to find an acceptable solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock stated her greater sympathy for new clause 17 which I share. The new clause is intended to provide that a ship is not to be treated as a wasting asset for the capital gains tax relief on the replacement of business assets. The change will enable a gain made on disposal of an asset, the proceeds of which are reinvested in a ship, to be deducted from the purchase price of the ship instead of being held in suspense for a maximum period of ten years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend acknowledged that this was a complicated set of provisions. At present, when the proceeds from disposing of certain trading assets are reinvested in new qualifying assets, capital gains tax can be deferred by rolling over. The gain on the old asset is not charged but deducted from the cost of the new asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the replacement asset is a wasting asset with a predictable life not exceeding 50 years—that definition includes a ship, be it a fishing vessel or a deep sea liner—the gain is not rolled over. It is suspended until the asset ceases to be used in the trade or is disposed of or after ten years, whichever is the earliest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special provisions for wasting assets are necessary, as my hon. Friend and the hon. Lady will recognise. The gain on the old asset would otherwise wholly or in part escape the charge to tax because the value of the wasting asset is written down to nil over its life. In other words, the relief intended to defer the tax charge would, if the value of the wasting asset came to nil, become not a roll-over relief but a total exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that the provisions operate unfairly when the only valuable asset in the business is a wasting asset. The result is that any chargeable gain arising on its replacement will be recovered after a maximum period of ten years when no sales proceeds may be available to meet the tax bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, it may be an unhappy time for the sale. My hon. Friend drew attention to the particular problems with fishing vessels where the present provisions are said to deter the acquisition of more modern and expensive plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friends and I, the Inland Revenue recognises the theoretical nature of the problem but I am not aware that the present rules have yet caused significant problems in practice. It is unlikely but not impossible that disposals of fishing vessels may give rise to significant gains. However, problems could arise where the trader disposed of non-wasting assets and used the proceeds to purchase a fishing boat. Again, the Inland Revenue has not seen the problem in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the proposals in my hon. Friend's new clause are acceptable but I recognise that there may be a problem and we are sympathetic to trying to find a solution. We should like to see some examples of precisely where the provision is pinching, and we shall look at them sympathetically. I hope that with those remarks my hon. Friend will not push new clauses 8 and 17 to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hirst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my right honourable Friend's reply and to the hon. Member for Thurrock

(Dr. McDonald) for being so sympathetic to new clause 17, even though she could not find it in her heart to be sympathetic to new clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that capital gains tax reliefs already exist for small disposals. But, as my right honourable Friend said, there is a limit of 5 per cent of the land, or £20,000. The average agricultural property is laden with debt and a milk producer, for instance, will probably not be earning enough to pay the interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my right honourable Friend is sympathetic, and that he is prepared to hold further discussions with the Country Landowners Association. I hope that he will also have discussions with the Scottish Landowners Federation, and that it may be possible to devise a way of helping genuine cases while not allowing the potential abuse identified by the hon. Member for Thurrock.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me begin by declaring an interest. Hon. Members probably know that I act as an adviser to the unquoted companies group. The new clause is designed to benefit the hundreds of thousands of unquoted companies which account for well over 50 per cent of all activity in our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must pay tribute to the Government for the reliefs which they have already introduced for capital transfer tax—the abolition of lifetime accumulations, the extension of business reliefs on minority holdings and the reduction of the top rates from 75 per cent to 60 per cent. But they are not enough. Capital transfer tax has been little, if at all, eased for the larger unquoted companies. That is of particular significance to the new companies, started up in the past few years, which have been a major part of the Government's strategy aimed at regenerating the economy. Many such companies have been started up in my constituency, and, no doubt, in those of other hon. Members. But if those companies grow and prosper, they will find that the present structure of capital transfer tax will force them to become quoted companies.

They may choose in due course to become quoted companies because it is in their interest to do so: that is all well and good, but to force them to do so by means of an unjust tax is surely inequitable and contrary to the Government's policy. It will have a very damaging effect on the economy, all the more so because the assets of such companies are by nature illiquid. Liquid assets can be manipulated. It is possible to make provision against the incidence of tax. That is done all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>646</span>
time, and the tax system recognises it. But it is quite impossible to do that for illiquid assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of the tax as it is at present falls on the shareholder, but its incidence falls on the unquoted company. It therefore amounts to an additional tax paid only on unquoted companies. If it applied to the quoted companies sector, every 30 years or so all the assets of a company such as ICI would be subject to capital transfer tax. That is the distinction between the two sorts of company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advance this course for several reasons. Unquoted companies are specifically deserving of our approbation. They are specifically deserving of proper tax provision which eliminates the current unfairness in the system. The new jobs that will come in the future—as almost any view of the source of new jobs will affirm— will come from the smaller companies. Every survey has shown that new jobs are likely to be created in companies with fewer than 5,000 employees. To my knowledge, not one unquoted company in the country employs more than 5,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those companies are likely to be the growth companies for employment. The capital transfer tax has become the most serious problem imposed upon them by Government. Small unquoted companes face many problems, but the most serious, and the one which lies in the Government's hands, is capital transfer tax. The current structure of the tax makes it impossible for companies to make the provision required to preserve the family element when tax becomes payable. The incidence of the tax forces companies to become public. That is not a just way to treat the sector of the economy that is of fundamental importance, as it always has been and always will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware of the study published in 1984 by two Oxford academics Mr. Morris and Mr. Hay. They demonstrated conclusively that by virtually any criteria, the unquoted company is more efficient than the quoted company. There are good reasons why that should be so. The study proved beyond doubt that the profit returns on assets are better, the growth of net assets is greater and that almost any criteria of efficiency shows that the unquoted companies achieve a better rate of return than the quoted companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unquoted companies have to finance their own losses. There cannot be cross-subsidisation. Profits are reinvested over generations rather than distributed in dividends. Such companies can take a long view. The Committee will be aware that Lord Pilkington, who was head of an unquoted company for many years, said that one of his major innovations would never have occurred if he had had a quoted company. Shareholders of a quoted company could not take the long-term view required for substantial investment over decades. Such investment is important to research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unquoted companies sector, employing well over 50 per cent of labour in this country, deserves our special attention. If anything in the tax system makes it more difficult for the unquoted companies sector to survive, it should be eliminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of the tax that I have suggested would be on the shareholders, but the incidence would fall on the company. If the bill is substantial—it will be for any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>647</span>
unquoted company that has grown through inflation as so many have in the past two decades—the company will have to fund an enormous burden of capital transfer tax. Hon. Members may know family companies in their constituencies which have had to restrict their growth because of the danger that the incidence of the tax imposes if those companies had to pay substantial capital transfer tax. The nature of such businesses is that the time when the tax is payable cannot be forecast. One-third of the members of the Institute of Directors die of a heart attack before they reach pensionable age. The strains of running a growing business and securing the necessary finance are considerable. It is not possible to forecast the time when the tax may become payable. That itself poses a further threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose in my new clause that 100 per cent business relief should be allowed, and that it should apply to both minority and majority shareholders. The argument for relieving minority interests at a lower rate, as happens at present, confuses two different discounts— the discount for non-controlling interests is a commercial discount, reflecting market realities. In any particular case it may be a larger or smaller sum than the difference between 50 per cent and 30 per cent business reliefs that currently exist. But a controlling interest is normally valued by the market at significantly more per share than a minority interest. However, it is in the nature of many such companies that there are not just two interests—a majority interest and a minority interest—but a collection of minority interests which mesh together to run the company. It is wrong to draw a distinction between a minority and a majority interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the cost of my proposal? On 1985 figures it is difficult to quantify it, and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says about it. As far as I am able to judge, the cost of increasing business reliefs—as the new clause is drafted, that would apply to all businesses, not just industrial but agricultural—would be about £30 million. If we divide that in two, between the agricultural and industrial sectors, that would be £15 million each. On top of that, the full cost of the increase in business and agricultural property relief from 20 per cent to 30 per cent was put at £5 million in the 1983 Financial Statement and Budget Report—£2.5 million for each agricultural and industrial sector. On that basis, the cost of increasing 30 per cent existing business relief to 100 per cent would be about £17.5 million. The remaining sum would affect those areas which are accounted for in discretionary trusts—about £17.5 million. In all probability, the cost would be about £50 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The return to the nation by enabling unquoted companies to grow to their full potential, particularly in the light of the great number of new companies starting up at present and over the past few years, would quickly repay any concession that was made. It is the best way to secure the growth of employment in this country that we need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just a few points to make about the new clause. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it would be restricted in its application to unquoted companies. It would be interesting to hear the Minister's comments on that because I suspect that the new clause would go much wider and would exempt business property from capital transfer tax entirely. If that is the case, even with the restriction which the hon Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>648</span>
intends, the provision may not achieve what is intended for unquoted companies, the Government Front Bench will not be at all surprised to hear that the Opposition cannot support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I heard the hon. Gentleman say that the cost would be £50 million. If the clause goes wider than he intends, I am sure that the Minister will confirm that the cost would be higher than £50 million. If my interpretation is correct, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what the cost would be in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely with my hon. Friend that the unquoted sector is important to the economy. It is important in his constituency, as in many other constituencies. His proposal would give 100 per cent capital transfer tax relief to transfers of holdings in unincorporated businesses, including controlling shareholdings in such businesses, including minority shareholding in unquoted companies and including, as the hon. Lady said, certain assets such as business assets and business property. The scope would be much wider than hon. Members may have gathered from my hon. Friend's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic, full-year cost of the new clause in static terms—that is to say, applied to the number of transactions which currently take place and the amount of value involved—would be about £30 million in addition to the £20 million already involved. It would more than double the cost of the relief. It would be difficult not to extend it to agricultural assets, and that has a current cost of £30 million. The extension to agriculture would be an extra £40 million. We would be talking about combining the two, making about £70 million in total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the proposal is not only that that would be a substantial relief but that it would clearly change the behaviour of potential taxpayers. Relief of 100 per cent in respect of any particular type of asset would undoubtedly generate transactions where the ownership of those assets and their transfer would be influenced by tax planning. The behavioural chance would almost certainly produce a very much greater cost. It would be a costly exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present regime should not be underestimated. At present, we have 50 per cent relief for unincorporated businesses, 30 per cent relief for minority shareholdings. That is already on the basis of capital transfer tax rates which have been reduced. Most importantly, there is a period of deferred payment over ten years by instalments for tax payments in respect of such assets. Not only does that reduce the quantum but it greatly reduces the difficulty of meeting substantial sums unexpectedly or at short notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present regime is more favourable to unquoted companies than my hon. Friend has recognised, and I have to say that, in view of the potential for the extension of the use of the relief, if it were increased in the way that he proposes, I am not convinced that it would be wise for the Committee to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to declare an interest as an adviser to the unquoted companies group, which has an interest in the clause, though the interest in the clause goes much wider. The concern about the problem which it seeks to redress is more widespread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my arguments have been rehearsed in earlier debates in Committee of the whole House in the clause stand part debate on clause 64, so I hope that I can be slightly briefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that debate, I welcomed the extension of indexation relief, but regretted that my right honourable Friend the Chancellor had not found it possible to go further in this Bill. The reasons for extending relief against taxation on purely inflationary gains were expressed eloquently by my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary, when he told the Committee that in the 20 years since capital transfer tax was introduced in 1965, the retail prices index had increased by no less than 535 per cent. He commented that that showed the extent to which so-called chargeable gains contain a large inflationary element. He said that some three-fifths of the apparent pre-1982 gain were pure inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no philosophical objection to the taxation of capital gains, but I have a strong objection to the taxation of so-called gains which are the effects of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief needed could be given by extending indexation relief back to 1965 or the year of acquisition of the chargeable assets. However, I am mindful of administrative complications which would arise if we were to adopt that approach, so the relief proposed in the new clause is of a more rough and ready nature. It recognises that the notional gains in the 1960s and 1970s were overwhelmingly a reflection of inflation and not a reflection of any real capital appreciation. That is hardly surprising as this was a period of predominantly inflationary Socialist Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause proposes a cut-off of liability to capital gains tax for assets held for five years. By relieving assets acquired before April 1980 from CGT liability, total relief would be given for the inflationary gains arising in the first 15 years of operation of CGT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relief would, of course, also be given for any small real capital appreciation over that same period. Conversely, inflationary gains arising between April 1980
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>650</span>
and March 1982 would remain within the charge to CGT. For that reason, I described my new clause as a somewhat rough and ready one. However, it has the merit of providing for the relief for the main era of inflationary gains, while avoiding the considerable administrative complexity of extending the indexation relief further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was encouraged by the comments of my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary that he shared my concern that we should not tax gains which are purely a reflection of inflation as capital gains. However, I shall understand if my hon. Friend is reluctant to accept my new clause tonight on grounds of costs. I have said before that my right honourable Friend the Chancellor's judgment of his Budget priorities this year, within a Budget in which the scope for tax relief was limited, was the right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, if my hon. Friend finds that he cannot accept new clause 12 for this year's Bill, I hope that he can give me an assurance that the measures contained in this year's Finance Bill do not represent the final chapter in the reform of capital gains tax and that there will be an opportunity in future years to provide further relief for taxpayers from taxation on the purely inflationary element of their notional gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the reprobate tax, CGT, cannot be described as having been reformed until the element of taxation on inflationary gains has been removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can be extremely brief on new clause 12 which goes, I think, a little wider than the hon. Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) intended, in that it appears to abolish capital gains tax on assets held for more than five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Government, or, indeed, Conservative Members, will be surprised to learn that we cannot support the new clause. We should like to know its cost implications and to hear the Government's attitude to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to hear a contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts), even at this late stage in our proceedings. I have not been present throughout but I welcome the way in which he, after a long period of patience, took the opportunity to introduce new clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of the proposed change, regardless of cost or policy, should not be underestimated. I do not like to respond to or reject ideas put forward in Committee on purely technical grounds, but it is fair to place them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be very difficult under present arrangements to have a cut-off period of five or any other number of years because with pooled holdings one would have to find rules for re-establishing the information that would determine which holdings went back beyond a certain date. That is a technical point, but it shows that although on the face of it the new clause appears to represent a simplification, it would not be so in every respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my right honourable Friend the Chancellor spoke of capital gains tax in his Budget statement he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With these reforms, I believe that the tax is now on a broadly acceptable and sustainable basis."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 March 1985; Vol. 75, c. 796.]</p></blockquote>
That statement covers the provisions which we have introduced whereby all post-1982 inflationary gains
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>651</span>
are now taken out of capital gains tax. That was an important reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not encourage my hon. Friend the Member for Slough to think that we can go further. He has, very shrewdly, determined that one of the reasons why I would have to give that response is that the cost of a change of this type would be so large. The full year cost of my hon. Friend's proposal would be about £850 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of both this, and future, Budgets, £850 million is the sort of sum that it is not easy to find for relieving measures of the kind proposed by my hon. Friend. However, he has drawn attention to the fact that inflationary gains are a pernicious feature of the capital gains tax regime. We have taken action to deal with those, post-1982, and for the time being that is as far as the Government feel able to go. We do not believe that it would be right to make a major change of the kind proposed in new clause 12. It would bear a heavy cost and we have to weigh carefully priorities in taxation, and particularly in capital taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not dwell on the new clause at great length because the Committee will be familiar with the arrangements in clause 45, which we have already discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing arrangements there is a two-year time limit for elections. Several of those who have commented on the Bill have said that if the two-year time limit on elections is retained, we shall not be able to determine after two years which choice to make because the necessary facts will not be available to enable us to arrive at an intelligent decision. After all, the object of an election is presumably to allow a person to choose the course of action that favours him most as a taxpayer. Those who have commented have suggested that the limit should be extended to four or six years. My new clause is modest, and suggests that the period should be four years. I hope that my right honourable Friend will look favourable on that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has said, the new clause would extend from two to four years the time limit allowed for partners to elect to have their business treated as a continuing one following a change in the membership of the partnership. The new clause supplies the partnership changes caught by clause 45 of the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>652</span>
Although the cost is not quantifiable, it would clearly be likely to reduce the yield from the clause 45 charge. My hon. Friend has made it clear that those using the extra time for the election would do so presumably to ensure that they paid not more tax but the least tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the existing two-year time limit is not to make that fine judgment about the amount of tax involved but to give the old and new members of a partnership time to go through all the necessary paperwork that is involved in an election. My hon. Friend has made it clear that his purpose is to give a greater length of time so that the option can be chosen for the purposes of limiting the amount of tax payable. The new clause seeks to extend the time limit in a way that those involved in the partnership would wish, but it does not conform with the thinking behind the changes that have been made in clause 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has been suggested by the Historic Houses Association. It deals with maintenance funds and capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important feature of the Government's capital taxation policy is deliberately to encourage lifetime transfers. That is particularly important in regard to maintenance funds. It is much more satisfactory for all parties involved and for the future protection of the heritage if the property can be designated, the undertakings agreed, and the maintenance fund established during the settlor's lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, although the reduced CGT rates during lifetime encourage the establishment of maintenance funds during lifetime, there is a reverse effect. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>653</span>
CGT consequences of setting up a fund during lifetime outweigh the reduced rates gained. I shall not detain the Committee with the technical details—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members that it is not in order for a hon. Member to come between the Member speaking and the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Particularly if he is a Government Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a moment that I was out of order. Little did I know that the Whip was putting his foot in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted by your kindness, Miss Fookes, I was saying that I would not detain the Committee with a lengthy explanation, but I assure the Committee that the imbalance exists. There is substantial advantage in delaying the setting up of a maintenance fund until the settlor's death. That is thought to be one of the main reasons why, of the 80 maintenance funds submitted to the Treasury as applications, only 20 have been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to redress the imbalance and to create an added incentive to establish the maintenance fund during lifetime. That is achieved by treating the settlor of a maintenance fund as though he were the life tenant of a strict settlement for the purposes of CGT. There are already parallels and precedents with income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would bring maintenance funds within the terms of section 55 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979. On the death of the settlor there would be a deemed disposal of the property and its immediate reacquisition by the trustees at current market value with no chargeable gain. That would place lifetime maintenance fund settlements on the same basis as those settled by will for the purpose of calculating future CGT liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that it is not envisaged that the new clause would cause any loss of revenue. It is simply an attempt to provide an incentive for settlors to proceed to establish maintenance funds during their lifetimes. The arrangement would have substantial administrative benefits for settlors, the Treasury and expert outside bodies involved in setting up maintenance funds for historic buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) on raising that point by means of new clause 21. I should like to give some mild support to his proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is correct to say that there will be no loss of revenue as a result of his new clause. I shall wait for the Minister's guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding of the new clause is that there could be a potential loss of revenue if someone set up a maintenance fund during his lifetime that would not have been set up on his death, although it was his intention that the maintenance fund should be set up on his death. Once a maintenance fund is established, we are effectively safeguarding the historic building. If there were a conceivable loss of income we would gain the historic building and the funds to maintain it. I wanted to be clear about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>654</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar), because he is an expert on the matter. I shall come back to it in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would value the assets dedicated to the maintenance fund at the time when the maintenance fund was set up, as though the fund had been established at the time of the settlor's death. It could take many years. The valuation is for capital gains tax purposes. If a person living in a historic house intends to set up a maintenance fund, with the arrangements to take effect on his death through his will, the assets will be valued at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Enfield, North says that if a settlor decides to create the maintenance fund while he is still alive—I sympathise with that—at present the assets are valued at that point. The hon. Gentleman proposes that they should be valued at his death. The point is to reduce capital gains tax liability at some time in the future, so I suspect that there is a loss of revenue, although I am prepared to accept the Minister's guidance on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a strong argument in favour of the new clause, if we want to encourage the provision of maintenance funds. I am concerned about the houses and the community's interest in the houses; I am not so concerned about the interests of the people who live in them. My prejudice in that respect is well known. From that point of view, there are two advantages to the community in establishing the maintenance fund as early as possible. First, it means that the maintenance fund is established and takes effect. Proper maintenance of the historic building is ensured because the maintenance fund is established with the agreement of the Treasury—it is now to be the Inland Revenue, I know, and I have reservations about that—and it is responsible for ensuring that the fund is adequate to maintain the property. Such arrangements should be made without delay. There will be the benefit of the arrangements being in place for several years. Otherwise a house could be neglected, for financial reasons rather than any other reasons, until the death of the person who wishes to set up the maintenance fund. It is a marginal advantage.

Second and more important, if the arrangements are made earlier rather than later, the public have access earlier rather than later. That is one of the main advantages of these taxation arrangements. So I have strong sympathy with the new clause, and am disposed to support it. Against that background, I await the Minister's comments with great interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the cost of the new clause would be pretty small, although at present it is difficult to put a figure on it. So cost is not the determinant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) have a long speech, but I shall give the shortened version. The purpose of the clause is to provide an automatic uplift for capital gains tax purposes of the assets in the heritage maintenance fund when the settlor dies. The Government's record, as my hon. Friend and other hon. Members will acknowledge, shows how fully we appreciate the importance of heritage maintenance funds in protecting our heritage, and I was delighted to have the support of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>655</span>
Significant tax advantages have already been granted to heritage maintanance funds. There is no charge to capital transfer tax when property is transferred into them, nor when trustees make distributions for heritage purposes, and the funds are exempt from the ten-yearly charge to capital transfer tax that falls on discretionary trusts generally. So there are significant advantages. My hon. Friend suggests that an additional advantage should be made available to this type of trust, which presumably would not be available for other discretionary trusts. But once that happened, others would queue up, saying, "Why not us as well?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that about 20 funds have already been set up, and that a further 80 are in the pipeline. I understand that many of them will be set up during the lifetime of the settlors. So I am not persuaded that there is a case at present for a further relaxation in the tax treatment of these funds. We shall keep the matter under review, and as concern was expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North, which to some extent was echoed by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, about a blockage in setting up funds during the lifetime of settlors, we shall not close the door. All we are saying is that now does not seem to be the appropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will withdraw the new clause, with the assurance that we shall keep the matter under review. If we hear of cases that support his point of view, we shall reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disappointed by what my right honourable Friend says. There have been 80 applications, and only 20 funds have been set up since the maintenance funds were established. In a way, that speaks for itself. I hope that my right honourable Friend will give an undertaking tonight that he will consult the Historic Houses Association over the next year, and ask his officials to go through individual cases so that when we discuss the matter next year, as we surely will, we shall have firm evidence on which to make a judgment. At present, one side says one thing and the other side another. I am sure all hon. Members agree that if we had evidence, we would accept it as a basis on which to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give my hon. Friend that assurance. My advice is that 20 funds have been set up—not 20 out of 80. A further 80 are in the process of negotiation. Officials of the Inland Revenue tell me that they believe that a substantial majority of the remaining 80 will be set up in the settlors' lifetime. I agree with my hon. Friend than any disputes about facts should be resolved so that we can proceed on an agreed basis, and I am happy to assure him that we shall move in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I shall take the Minister's advice on the matter. However, I am disappointed to learn that only 20 funds have been set up. Twenty funds after seven years is not a very fast rate of growth: it is only three a year. Of course, it is possible that, out of the 80, a further 50 are about to come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been given some figures tonight, and it may be the first time that we have had those statistics from the Treasury. We shall monitor progress. Certainly, I have the strong impression that the Treasury—now the Inland Revenue—is not exactly pushing the proposal.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>656</span>
It has merit from the point of view of the community and for me that is the overwhelming factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State did not reply to our earlier debates on this issue, so I shall repeat for his benefit what I said to the Chief Secretary on that occasion. I said last year that the arrangement has proceeded by agreement between both sides of the House, under a Labour Government and latterly under a Conservative Government, and that is unusual. The arrangement was made with the agreement of both sides, and there was no political division between us. In fact, where there was a difference of opinion, as happened the other evening, people willingly gave way to ensure that we proceed on an agreed basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the unusual suggestion that I made last year, and again the other night, that there might be some merit in involving the Opposition in the discussions between the Treasury and the Inland Revenue and the Historic Houses Association without waiting for the Finance Bill, and all that that involves. It is an instance where discussions could take place between both sides without commitment before the Budget and the Finance Bill, and it would be welcomed by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause looks complex but its aim is simple—to re-enfranchise private companies for Revenue-approved schemes for share options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have witnessed recently a revolution in employee share ownership, which is an important aspect in the concept of a share-owning democracy. The revolution in share ownership has been particularly important to small and medium-sized companies. I need not remind hon. Members that we look to the smaller, and particularly the private, companies for a significant contribution to the regeneration of our industrial base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the one feature that characterises the private company is its need to limit access to its shares. That need has become apparent from experience gained over
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>658</span>
the years by private companies. It is important that they exercise a great deal of care over who owns their shares. Among the necessary safeguards is the need to include in their articles of association a provision that departing employees may be required to sell back their shares. That applies particularly to employees who may be leaving to work for a competitor or who may have a disruptive influence on the company. There are plenty of safeguards for such people because the sale of shares is always for their full value. Safeguards include professional valuation and the protection of the courts, so it is all fair and above board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standard provisions of articles of private companies were routinely accepted by the Inland Revenue for share option schemes approved under the Finance Act 1980, but last year the Inland Revenue concluded that although the practice was consistent with earlier legislation, it was not consistent with the precise drafting of the Finance Acts of 1980 and 1984. The Inland Revenue issued a press release on 11 June this year confirming that the Revenue would not now approve any share option scheme for companies that retained the power to require departing employees to sell their shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need to remove that obstacle, which is probably unintended, and to permit the Revenue once again to approve share option schemes for private companies, should commend itself to members of the Committee. It is important to encourage share option schemes and the ownership of shares, particularly in small companies. It is a new concept, and I am delighted that small companies have taken up the challenge so that those working for small or medium-sized companies have the same privileges as people working for ICI. I should like to see the obstacle removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would express some support for new clause 22. Indeed, I think that Opposition Members made similar points during our debates a year ago, and the whole concept of share ownership by employees arose from the provisions of a Finance Act introduced by a Labour Government a few years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that the restrictions applying to such schemes are intended to ensure that the employees are genuine shareholders—that they are not given "Mickey Mouse" or funny shares which are not full shares but carry all sorts of restrictions. The original concept was that the employee shareholder would be equal to a non-employee shareholder and have the same shares as everyone else, with the same rights arising from those shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned about the possibility of employees who leave the company being required to sell back their shares to the company at less than the market value. The hon. Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) is shaking his head. Clearly, he would agree with me that such a restriction would be undesirable. But I am rather concerned that this new clause might lead to that position, and none of us would want that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has some advantages, nevertheless, and there is an interesting analogy between the remarks of the hon. Gentleman and our debates on 4 June. The hon. Gentleman persuaded me because he echoed the arguments that I had advanced on the question of redeemable shares being issued to people who work in co-operative enterprises. The hon. Gentleman has now had a fortnight to reflect on the matter. I am delighted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>659</span>
that we are in agreement this evening because on that occasion he voted against my amendment, which was intended to provide for people who work for co-operative enterprises to be given shares that could be redeemed on their retirement or departure to other employment. Having expressed my reservations, and having teased the hon. Gentleman a little, I welcome his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman (Carshalton and Wellington)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In speaking to new clause 26 I should like to associate myself with the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) in support of new clause 22. The purpose of my new clause is simply to give further encouragement to employee ownership, and it is supported by Job Ownership Limited and the Institute of Directors. I have tabled the new clause principally because many Conservative Members—and probably Opposition Members, too—believe that people work best when working for themselves. Indeed, recent experience in the United Kingdom and abroad suggests that the principle is valid in both small and quite large companies. One has only to think of the examples of the John Lewis Partnership, the National Freight Consortium and, indeed, of family businesses that have become employee-owned and prospered as a result. The Baxi partnership and Scott Barda are examples of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the international scene, with which you are familiar from your travels, Miss Fookes, the Mondragon co-operatives in the Basque region of Spain and some plywood manufacturing co-operatives in the north-west of the United States have taken the same route quite successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may ask, "Why have there not been more success stories if this is such a satisfactory formula?" First, starting new employee-owned businesses is not an easy task except on a very small scale. Secondly, employee buy-outs and other conversions in existing businesses to employee ownership can also be very difficult because of legislative and other obstacles. Thirdly, there is still inadequate political support for the idea from both the Right and Left in British politics. That, sadly, has been the case for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opportunities are now beckoning for the number of new small worker co-operatives started up in this way to be increased. I am pleased to note that they are especially popular with young people. When we look at the figures—such as they are—for the recent period, we see that such co-operatives are being started and registered at a rate of some 250 a year, that there are now more than 1,000 of them and that the great majority are less than five years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, fewer employee-owned firms are being registered as share companies under the Companies Act. I am thinking in particular of such successful examples as Manchester Cold Rollers, which has built and sold a much improved machine for the cold roll forming of steel sections. The Duke of Edinburgh recently opened the production line incorporating the machine, and praised it as an admirable example of new British technology. Manchester Cold Rollers has also started to manufacture and sell Britain's first ever heavy-duty bicycle padlock, which is now exported successfully to a number of continental countries. This formula is successful, and by giving further opportunities to such companies we would, I believe, be supporting enterprise and initiative in a very satisfactory way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>660</span>
Even greater opportunities beckon with regard to employee buy-outs and other conversions in existing businesses. We see that in the public sector as one consequence of our privatisation programme, and also in the private sector, especially in family businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that our right honourable and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary, then Chancellor, said during a Budget speech that he wanted more employees to own a share in the companies for which they work. Later in the same speech he said that he wanted to ease the path of employees who wish to buy the companies for which they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause is directed towards the same basic objectives. It would remove a number of technical obstacles to employee ownership, and it would not prove expensive. I have seen evidence that in the case of the National Freight Consortium the revenue forgone in that 12-month period was not in excess of £1 million. I also understand that proposals along the lines that I am recommending enjoy at least tacit support in other Government Departments, notably the Department of Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have been as quiet as a mouse for some time, I should now like to say a word about each part of the new clause. Subsection (2) would ease the present 12-month interest relief restriction so that new employees could buy shares in their own companies regardless of the fact that they were not in a position to do so during the 12 months following a successful employee buy-out. That would be particularly equitable and helpful between different categories of employees in the National Freight Consortium. It would also end an unfair discrimination between employees in employee-controlled companies and employees of most closed companies and partners in professional partnerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) would allow partial employee trust ownership within the definition of employee-controlled companies. That would reduce the risks of de-capitalisation and make financial costs more competitive. It would also help such firms as the Baxi partnership, which I have already mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) would exempt employee-controlled companies from provisions in the Finance Act 1978 relating to employee share ownership schemes introduced by companies with two classes of shares. That again would benefit the National Freight Consortium, which faces the problem now. It would also obviate similar problems which any future imitators of the NFC would face. The NFC is prevented from taking advantage of the tax concessions available to almost all quoted companies, and others could be similarly prevented from following that path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) would extend the exemption from capital transfer tax when a family business chooses to follow what may be called the Baxi route to employee ownership. At present, exemption from CTT is already available when a company gives 51 per cent or more of its shares to an employee trust. In this case, it would happen only if at the end of the relevant transaction the former company shareholders were no better off than they would have been if they had made a direct transfer of 51 per cent of the equity to the employee trust as a gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 midnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 is entirely in line with Conservative support for wider diffusion of wealth and property. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0889">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>661</span>
will help to increase the strength of identification between individual employees and the firms for which they work. It will make a small but significant contribution to overcoming many of the barriers between "them and us" that have damaged our industrial and commercial performance for so long. I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already had an interesting debate, and I do not suggest that we continue at length. I know that it is late, but this important issue affects many of our constituents. I am happy to note some common interest across the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) to draw attention to our previous discussions on co-operative shares. He will know that a departing employee will, when he has to sell because of pre-emption restrictions, get a value relating to the equity of his shares whereas the departing co-operative employee would have his shares redeemed at redemption par value. I know that the hon. Gentleman will want to wage that debate again and again, and he is right to tweak our tails a little at this juncture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) and for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) rightly reminded us of the importance of those issues. I have a copy of part of the speech made by my right honourable and learned Friend the present Foreign Secretary from the 1982 period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be useful if I go into the issue in detail. I apologise for speaking at length, but the issue is of great importance to people outside. While both new clauses deal with employee share ownership, they cover completely different aspects of it. The first, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South, proposes a relaxation to the statutory requirements of approved employee share schemes. The second, spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Walling-ton, proposes further special tax treatment to encourage employee-controlled companies. I shall take the new clauses separately as they cover different issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin with the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South, which he moved beguilingly, as though he were proposing a modest extension. The conditions for Revenue approval of an employee profit-sharing or share-option scheme include a requirement that any restrictions attaching to shares, used in the company's scheme must attach to all shares of the same class. Therefore, if a company has in its articles of association a provision that any shareholder wanting to sell must offer first refusal to existing shareholders, there would be no objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if a company has or wishes to make special rules applying only to employee shareholders and requiring them to offer their shares to existing members of the company if they leave their job, the Finance Act statutory provisions would not be satisfied—because the restriction operates only on shares held by employees—and approval of the scheme would be withheld. The new clause seeks to modify existing provisions so that the employee pre-emption arrangements would not be regarded as a restriction for the purposes of all three types of tax-favoured employee share schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognises that for some companies, in particular small family-owned companies, retaining tight control over the ownership of their shares is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>662</span>
of great importance. Such a company might be reluctant to set up an employee share scheme which would leave a resigning employee free to take his shares with him. I can understand why. The company may see a risk, especially if ex-employees have significant holdings, in terms of nuisance and even the threat to control. The family may consider it unreasonable that ex-employees should benefit from any growth in the value of the company after they had left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some firms, especially high technology firms, will not want to run the risk of their shares falling into the hands of competitors, who would then have access to their annual reports and the right to attend meetings. However, I am pleased to remind my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South that that risk can now be reduced owing to a change of revenue practice, which I shall explain in a moment. My hon. Friend might have misinterpreted what he sees as a revenue change of interpretation for the 1984 schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no change of interpretation regarding employee pre-emption arrangements last year. That point has simply been highlighted because of the great interest shown in the 1984 scheme. Some of the arguments that I have just adumbrated may be more apparent than real. How likely is it that small companies will give shares or options over shares to employees to such an extent that those shareholders will represent a threat to existing control of the company? Is it really unreasonable that ex-employees should benefit from growth in value of the company occurring after they have left, when their efforts before departure may have contributed to that later growth? I have already referred to the capacity of the company to include in its articles of association a provision that any shareholder wishing to sell must offer first refusal to existing shareholders. And as I shall explain in a moment, the company's directors may be empowered to veto transfers of shares, so long as that power is not exercised to discriminate against scheme shares. Those possibilities represent potentially valuable reassurance to the small company which fears that the introduction of an approved employee share scheme may be in some way dangerous or at least inappropriate for the reasons sometimes suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim has always been the encouragement of real employee participation through the ownership of ordinary shares in the employees' company, rather than the ownership of specially treated classes of employee shares or specially restricted shares—a point that the hon. Member for Hodge Hill quite rightly identified as being very important. That is part of the rationale for the statutory requirement that any restrictions must attach to all shares of the same class. We are not aiming at the creation of second-class shareholdings for employees. The involvement and motivation of directors and employees and the promotion of employee and wider share ownership seem likely to be imperfectly served by the use of specially restricted shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be suggested in answer to that, that nevertheless if pre-emption restrictions were permitted, some companies might introduce schemes—to the benefit of both themselves and their employees—which might not otherwise do so. But that raises other considerations. The pressure for a relaxation has come in the context of the Finance Act 1984 share option scheme. That new scheme has proved extremely popular, which I know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0890">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>663</span>
my hon. Friends will be happy to learn. Over 1,300 schemes have already been submitted to the Revenue for approval, and we feel that it would be right and essential to allow more time for it to settle down before making any changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause raises other questions. It embraces all companies. If at some stage pre-emption restrictions were to be permitted in the context of approved schemes, the question would arise as to whether that should apply to all companies—as the new clause proposes. It might be preferable to limit such a change to private—non-PLC—companies only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if employee pre-emption is permitted, it may be necessary to protect employee shareholders by defining the price at which shares must be disposed of, perhaps not simply by putting a ceiling on the price, as the new clause proposes, but by imposing a floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that the difficulties faced by small or private companies seem capable of exaggeration. A recent change of practice by the Inland Revenue, following legal advice, has already led to an easement that will help family-controlled companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As announced in a press release—my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South referred to it—issued on 11 June it is now acceptable for a company operating an approved employee share scheme to include in its articles of association a discretionary power of veto— provided the power will not be used to discriminate against transfers of scheme shares. That veto can be exercised by the directors to prevent the direct transfer of shares into "unfriendly" hands. Some private companies have already said that that revised interpretation will probably help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, while acknowledging that a respectable case can be made for easing the existing provisions, we decided not to legislate this year. However, the question of employee pre-emption is important. That, again, was mentioned by the hon. Member for Hodge Hill. I hope I have shown sufficient sympathy for the intent of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South while illustrating some of the issues surrounding the question that merit further consideration, to enable my hon. Friend to withdraw his new clause, recognising from the debate and my comments that I shall consider it further before the next Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington seeks to make four specific amendments to tax legislation, their common thread being to provide further relief for employees and employee trusts as regards share acquisition and ownership. The new clause deals with three different areas of taxation, and I shall deal with each in turn. I have seen people such as those in the Baxi group, and many organisations are very interested in what we are discussing tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (2) and (3) of the new clause concern the interest relief for employee buy-outs, which was introduced in 1983. Employees can obtain relief for interest paid on loans used to buy shares before or within 12 months after the buy-out—that is, when the company becomes over 50 per cent employee-owned and controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of the new clause seeks to extend the relief to all employees who buy their shares within 12 months of joining an employee-controlled company. In other words, relief would no longer be confined to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>664</span>
employees who bought their shares before or shortly after the buy-out. It would be available for all subsequent employees who bought shares, provided that they bought them within a year of starting employment. That would largely transform the provision from one which was aimed at the buy-out to one that made continuing relief available regardless of when shares were bought in relation to the time of the buy-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there are different views about how far we should go in that respect, but the proposal goes well beyond the aims that we had in mind in introducing the relief. Our specific and limited purpose is to provide the relief which already exists on the statute book, and some initial help for employees who want to take over or start up their own enterprise. The relief is targeted at the start-up period, which is generally the most critical time for the survival of such a venture. It is right to adhere to that concept and not risk moving towards providing interest relief for employee share-buying generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) of the new clause would count shares held by a trust for the benefit of employees as employee-owned, in deciding whether the company met the buy-out relief test of being over 50 per cent employee-owned and controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The buy-out relief would help employees who take over and run their own companies. We are looking for genuine employee ownership and control, so one of the tests is that the shares are beneficially owned by the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when a share trust arrangement is interposed, things may be different. Beneficial ownership of shares held by the trust will depend on the terms of the trust. If the shares are appropriated to individual employees so that they eventually have ownership rights and benefits, they would be regarded as the beneficial owners. But if the trust is set up so that the employees can benefit only at the trustees' discretion, with no right to the shares held in trust, they are unlikely to meet the beneficial ownership test. In the latter case, the employees do not have control themselves. No doubt, it would lie with the trustees. It would go beyond the circumstances which we had in mind to extend relief to such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of schedule 9(8) to the Finance Act 1978 which was rightly referred to by the hon. Member for Hodge Hill is to reduce the risk that companies will set up special classes of shares for employees which could receive especially favourable treatment, such as large dividends and frequent bonus issues. Such treatment would have the effect of extending the generous income tax relief already available under the profit-sharing provisions, to cover additional employee-only benefits, which were never intended to be relieved in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is only one class of share, there is little risk of that sort of abuse. The 1978 legislation therefore stipulates that if a company has more than one class of ordinary share capital, the majority of the shares used in the profit-sharing scheme must be held by outsiders. Outsiders in this context means individuals other than those who have acquired their shares as employees or trustees who are holding shares on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employee buy-outs often involve equity participation by financing institutions for which a special class of shares may be provided. That brings into play the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>665</span>
requirement that the majority of profit-sharing scheme shares have to be held by individual outsiders. The Government recognise that in practice, it may therefore be difficult for some employee-owned companies to operate approved employee share schemes. The 1980 savings-related share option legislation and the share options provisions of the Finance Act 1984 both have a requirement comparable to that in the Finance Act 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The favourable tax treatment for employee share schemes has been introduced in part so that employees would be encouraged to take a stake in their company when they might not otherwise have the opportunity to do so. That acts as an incentive to the employee. It is arguable whether there is any justification for changing the legislation to achieve this objective in circumstances where the employees effectively own the company already. Provided that an employee-owned company only has one class of share it can, of course, operate an approved scheme. However, the Government are sympathetic to those companies and will give further consideration to this question before next year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to capital transfer tax, subsection (5) is designed to extend an existing exemption so as to make it apply when a transfer of shares in a company results in an employee trust gaining control of the company, even though the employee trust may not take the shares directly. The exemption would only apply if the shareholder received 49 per cent or less of the value of the shares that he transfers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 28 of the Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984 already provides an exemption for direct transfer of shares to an employee trust—where the shares themselves become held by the employee trust. Subsection (5) of the new clause is intended to give exemption for indirect transfers when the shares which are transferred do not become held by the employee trust but when the result of the overall transaction is that the employee trust is left in control of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of indirect transfer which is usually suggested is a sale of shares to the company, using the purchase of own shares legislation introduced in 1982, followed by a cancellation of those shares. This is intended to leave the employee trust holding all or a majority of the shares which are left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position of such indirect transfers is that they will not attract a CTT charge if the price at which the shares are sold back to the company is an appropriate one for the shareholding and shareholder. Subsection (5) of the new clause would give exemption even if the price was not an appropriate one, provided that it represented not more than the value of 49 per cent of the shares which were transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the price at which the shares are sold back to the company is not an appropriate one, it is possible for value to pass between one shareholder and another. In those circumstances it is right that there could be CTT consequences. This means that a blanket exemption would bring with it avoidance possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear whether those supporting the clause envisage that all shareholders must sell all of their shares back to the company, which will then cancel
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>666</span>
them, before the exemption can apply. If all the shares are sold to the company and every shareholder receives less then the value of his shares there might be something in the proposal which merits further consideration. In those circumstances there would be little chance of benefits being passed from one shareholder to another. But, if the idea is that shareholders may retain some of their shares, or if the total shareholders can be shared disproportionately between the shareholders, then, even though the employee trust gains control of the company, an exemption would not be warranted because it would be possible for benefit to have passed between shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure my hon. Friend that I shall undertake discussions with officials on the new suggestion for 100 per cent conversions with a view to legislation in 1986. Clearly, I can make no commitment as I must examine the matter with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the length of my speech but the Committee will appreciate that this is an important matter covering many outside organisations. It is appropriate to conclude on the matter of wider share ownership, not having had the benefit of members of the Alliance throughout our deliberations. I cannot commend the Committee to accept the whole of the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington, but I shall certainly consider the points he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the support offered by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), who recognised the importance of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put on record that I was not trying to promote second-class shareholding. It was my intention that holders of such shares would have the full rights of normal shareholders. The only restriction would be that when employees left they would have to give the company first option of purchasing the shares back at full market value. I said that employees would have the protection of a professional valuation and, if necessary, they could refer to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend recognised the real fears of private companies. Over a period of years senior executives in a private company might pick up many shares and it could damage the company if those shares fell into the hands of a competitor. However, I take my hon. Friend's point about supplying to non-public limited companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever I have put a proposal on share options or share ownership the Liberals have supported me. I am delighted that the Liberal member of the Committee, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) has come in at the tail end of my speech to offer his support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's remarks and the fact that he will look at the matter again before the next Finance Bill are a major step forward. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Trotter) wrote to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and I wrote to my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary earlier this month about what is essentially a technical problem on management buy-outs, which I shall be happy to explain if any hon. Member wishes me to do so. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps the Liberal Member, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), would like an explanation. Would it be in order, Miss Fookes, to have a procedural motion to discover whether the Liberal Member is in a minority in wishing to hear a full explanation of my new clause.

I appreciate the difficulties, especially with what is called the new company route towards management buy-outs. We are well aware of the details. My hon.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which is alert to the matter and which has been holding discussions, has acknowledged the importance of the anti-avoidance nature of the matter. We seek ways of meeting the problem without damaging the anti-avoidance provisions that now exist.

Having said that, we would be prepared to have further discussions, and we would like further examples of where the existing provisions are biting. As far as I know, only one example has so far been produced, for which it was eventually shown that another route would have been better.

I have broken that silence to express my sense of confused deja vu about amendments Nos. 235 and 236. This morning, I was serving on the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Bill which arose out of the fact that the Scottish Law Commission started to investigate the bankruptcy law for Scotland in 1968. It reported 14 years later, in 1982. Three years after that, the Government introduced a Bill in the other place and made no amendment there. However, when the Bill reached its Committee stage in this House, 220 Government amendments were tabled to it. Moreover, the Insolvency Bill runs in tandem with that Bill. Recently, a further amendment was tabled to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Bill which stemmed from the Finance Bill. All three Bills are running in tandem.

that its representatives were not put under quite the same strain this year as last. I am sure that the Committee will allow me to pay a tribute to the officials and to the draftsmen who have enabled our debates to be even better informed than they might otherwise have been.

My hon. Friends on the Back Benches have shown a great deal of stamina, as always, and self-discipline. Their contributions have been uniformally well-informed, pointed and brief. I am sure that the Committee was impressed.

I hope I shall be allowed to pay a tribute to Opposition Members for their good humour and penetration, and for the way in which they contributed to our debates. Remembering other years, the contributions of Opposition Members on this occasion have made for a different tone and quality of debate, and I am sure the Bill will be a better piece of legislation for that.

Finally, I wish to pay a tribute to my colleagues on the Front Bench—my hon. Friends the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, and my right honourable Friend the Minister of State.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>672</span>
would not expect me to agree with him about the merits of the Bill. We have never regarded the Bill as a good one but we recognise that Ministers have done their best to defend the indefensible. One at least has had his efforts rewarded, and we are all pleased that the Minister of State has become a Privy Councillor. We congratulate him on that honour, which took place during the course of our proceedings.

On behalf of my hon. Friends, I also wish to thank our anonymous advisers. The Chief Secretary is supported by a team of people who sit at the top table. Our advisers are more anonymous and invisible but this year we have been served by a group of people that has been exceptional in quality and quantity. We are grateful to those people who, for reasons that we all understand, will not be identified but who read our proceedings with diligence and will take our expressions of gratitude as a true reward. Conservative Members should not believe that there are no good Socialists in the City of London.

We learn something every year during the proceedings of each Finance Bill. Last year I learnt that Opposition Members sit on this side of the Committee so that during an all-night sitting the sun is in their eyes when it rises in the morning. This year I learnt that the Chief Secretary, or whoever sits in his place, and the hon. Member who leads for the Opposition share a perk, which may be news to my hon. Friends. At each sitting of the Committee we receive a ballpoint pen, and no other member of the Committee is treated so generously by the staff of the House. I have had nine pens, because I take them away after each sitting. I am not sure whether they are regarded as a taxable benefit but, in view of our discussions on clause 41, my hon. Friends may be interested to know that there is a logo on the pens. I shall not read out the logo because the pens cannot be regarded as a taxable benefit, not least because not one of them has worked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish of me to say that points of order should be briefer than those have been. However, I wish to thank the two hon. Gentlemen for their kind remarks about me and to thank them on behalf of those who cannot do so. It has been a pleasure to preside over a very good-humoured Committee. I look forward to the pleasure on another occasion, but I have probably had enough for this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
