	<time>Tuesday 14 May 1985</time>
	<p>[Part 1]</p>
	<p>[Miss JANET FOOKES 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
	<p>(except clauses 3, 10, 35, 40, 54, 64 and 87 and schedules 12, 16 and 22)</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>
	<p>That during the proceedings on the Finance Bill (except clauses 3, 10, 35, 40, 54, 64 and 87 and schedules 12, 16 and 22) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Four o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Peter Rees</i>.]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill): Although the Opposition will not seek to oppose the sittings motion, I should like to make one or two comments about it. First, it is a source of great pleasure to us all that you have agreed to Chair our proceedings again, Miss Fookes. [HON. MEMBERS: " Hear, hear."] It seems that I have achieved total support, which I shall expect on other matters later. We all appreciate the way in which you Chaired our lengthy proceedings last year, Miss Fookes. We hope to share many pleasant summer evenings with you again this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Chief Secretary for the notes on clauses which were distributed to all Committee members. We all appreciate that courtesy. We do not wish to comment on the order in which the clauses will be taken. Indeed, we welcome the slight change in that we shall take clause 9 immediately after clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note the presence of the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport. I understand that it is not unprecedented for a Minister from another Department to take part in our proceedings. However, it has not occured in other Committees on which I have served. His presence is welcome, and we look forward to his expert advice on vehicle excise duty. We welcome it as a precedent in our proceedings. We shall expect a Minister from the Northern Ireland Office to advise us about the changes in social laws under clause 8. I am sure that my hon. Friends are actively examining the rest of the Bill to see which other Ministers we can request to help us in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have said many times at this point that they do not understand why the Standing Committee considering the Finance Bill sits only in the afternoons at 4.30. Every other Standing Committee sits in the mornings at 10.30. It would have reduced the wear and tear on the members of the Committee last year if we had begun in the morning instead of sitting quite so late and even into the following morning. I appreciate that it is done this way because it has always been done
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
this way. However, I hope that on this occasion, there will be a reform or change to our procedures. I hope that the Chief Secretary will explain why we continue to meet at 4.30 on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons and do not take advantage of morning sittings. Morning sittings would benefit Committee members whos constituencies are in Scotland and in other parts because they are anxious to leave at a reasonable hour on Thursday evenings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Wrexham): My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) does not have to worry for too long about sittings of the committee at 4.30 pm, because we shall be able to change that in two years' time. It is obviously sensible to have morning sittings so that the Finance Bill can be discussed properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this Bill, unlike last year's will detain us very long. The Problem with this Bill is what it does not contain, as opposed to last year's which contained much that should not have been included. The Opposition are not allowed to table amendments which would entail the spending of extra money and therefore we are somewhat circumscribed in the tabling of our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman gets truly launced, I remind him that we are considering a sittings motion and not the contents of the Bill or the absence of specific provisions from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, as always, for that reminder, Miss Fookes. I shall make a succinct statement, as usual, and say that, providing we can have answers to our questions from Ministers, a free and frank exchange of views and information and that no wilful attempts are made at misrepresentation, which is not unknown among Conservative Ministers—I exclude those here of course—I am sure that we can deal expeditiously with the Bill. For reasons that I gave earlier, with luck, the Bill should not take as long as it did last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Kingston upon Hull, West): I associate myself with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) about your chairmanship, Miss Fookes. I am delighted that you are Chairman again this year because, last year, it was like being launched into a new club. I thoroughly enjoyed last year's Finance Bill, and I new feel a really old hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to overrule what my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill said about the timing of our sittings, I am deeply concerned that the Treasury notes arrived rather late. I picked them out of my mail yesterday and, bearing in mind the complexity of the Bill, although it is a much shorter Bill than last year and many points in it could be regarded as slightly less contentious, nevertheless the information we received is complex and will take time to digest. Therefore, without wanting to overrule my hon.Friend, I suggest that we delay the sittings motion to enable Opposition Members to have more time to digest the numerous points contained in those notes.

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Opposition Members have particular difficulties because they have to do all the grafting themselves and do not necessarily receive the briefing given to Conservative Members. We had such an example last year. Because MPs are paid so little and have few support staff, extra difficulties are encountered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I feel strongly that we should delay the launch of the Bill because of the way in which the Treasury notes are written. They are written cleverly and accurately but, nevertheless, designed to confuse the enemy. The Government sees us as the enemy, and this stuff has been written to support the Government. We need to read every word very carefully to fully understand the Treasury's notes. It is for that reason that we need more time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we should start our sittings at about 10 o'clock at night, because many interest groups Bill
<br><br><!-- lb -->
outside read about the Finance Bill the newspapers and many of them have not yet sent in briefing information because they are unaware that the Bill is in Committee. We need to, wait for our daily mail to arrive-not the Daily Mail, because in Hull we have a very good newspaper called the Daily Mail, and I would not want to confuse the national trash with that very good provincial paper. We need time to digest the various briefing notes and letters that we shall receive from interest groups. We need a whole day to do that and, as we know, those interest groups tend to send such information to us at the last minute, which creates difficulties for Oppostion Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my views, and I have no wish to delay the Committee in its considerations of the Bill, but that would be in the best interests of high-quality debate. We all want high-quality debate, and to achieve that we must ensure that ho. Members have such information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) is missing from the Government Benches. Last year, he made invaluable contributions to our debates. It is a great pity that he is not on the Committee, and I wonder what is the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, West (Mr. Randall) not to, pursue that line, because it is not relevant to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am a constituent of the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth), and I am anxious to see him in the Committee today. I might not vote for him next time otherwise. Nevertheless, I shall not pursue that point, Miss Fookes, in the interests of your advice. I shall sit down and be very quiet for the rest of the proceedings. I suggest that we start our sittings at 10 o'clock at night delay the resolution of the sittings motion for about a month, and leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Finance Bill (except clauses 3, 10, 35, 40, 54, 64 and 87 and schedules 12, 16 and 22) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to move the order of consideration motion, there, area number of announcements that I should like to make. I shall, when necessary, repeat them at a later stage, but it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I make them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some former members of the Committee will probably know that this Room is not available on Thursday afternoons and therefore we shall have to meet in Room 11. It is, however, possible to move back into this Room after dinner and, if it is the Committee's wish-I expect that it will be because Room. 11 is cramped-I shall arrange that we move back into this Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Boxes have been provided for the use of hon. Members and, when not in use, they can be locked away in Room 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer, too, to the display of announcements on the Annunciator when a Division is called in the Committee? As a general rule, I shall allow three minutes from the time that the announcement is displayed-that is important-before I order the doors to be locked. I reserve the right to do so within three minutes if I am satisfied that the Committee is ready to proceed to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the dinner break-I am sure that all members of the Committee will be interested in that-generally, I shall call a halt at about 7 o'clock and take one and a half hours for dinner. That will, of course, depend a little upon whether there is a Division in the Chamber and on what business is being considered in the Committee.
When there is a Division in the Chamber, I shall allow a quarter of an hour for each Division, and, if they run one after another, I shall simply add 15 minutes for each one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a copy of the Ways and Means resolutions on the Table. The Bill is founded upon those, should any member of the Committee wish to have them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adequate notice should be given of amendments and, unless the circumstances are, in my view-not in the view of the Committee-exceptional, I shall not allow manuscript amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat those comments, where necessary, when we come to them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 7, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My earlier remarks were intended as a probing speech. The Chief Secretary did not respond to that probe, but I am sure that he will respond in writing with his usual courtesy because I made a serious point. I wish to know whether the Government will consider the matters that I raised earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. I make no apology for saying that. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and I share a keen interest in the cider industry. My hon. Friend was born in Devon and now lives in the county of Hereford and Worcester. I come from,Worcestershire—as it was formerly known—and spent many happy years in Somerset, which is also well known as a cider-producing county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our previous experiences and present residence give us a deep interest in the health, prosperity and employment propspects of the cider industry. If the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport catches your eye, Miss Fookes, I know that he will wish to associate himself with those remarks because he, too, represents a constituency in the county of Hereford and Worcester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking not only about cider, but about perry, which is the drink in the county of Worcestershire. Not for nothing was a pear the badge of Worcestershire. Perry is constituted in a similar way to cider, but uses pears instead of apples. I have not forgotten the day when, much smaller and younger, I wore a badge from the scouting movement which had a pear on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cider came to this country with William the Conqueror and a liking for it replaced the Anglo-Saxon devotion to the predecessor of beer. It was boosted by the Hundred Years War and became a popular drink. It was overtaken in the 19th century by beer, which has enjoyed much greater sales and therefore greater production than cider in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there has been a big increase in cider consumption in the past few years. The Minister of State told the Committee a year ago that cider consumption has increased by about 6 per cent. a year, and in 1982 there was an increase of 20 per cent. In 1983, it increased by 11 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A year ago, the Government increased the tax on cider disproportionately compared with the increase in the tax on beer. Although I do not think that brewers had reason to lobby out of concern for sales, because beer consumption still exceeds that of cider at a ratio of 25 to one, I know that the tax increase on cider was considered exceptionally high 12 months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workers in the cider industry and hon. Members who represent cider-producing constituencies have expressed fears about a fall in consumption. We made this point a year ago and were told by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Minister of State that he did not believe that there would be a fall in consumption as a result of the exceptional increase in the cider tax in 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, that increase means that a pint of cider became more expensive that a pint of beer. We have tabled the amendment to probe and to ask the Government to tell us of their findings in the past year. I have no doubt that they have kept a close watch on the industry, which is concentrated in rural areas. We are conscious of the fact that there is little alternative employment if people in the industry lose their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment appears to seek to prevent any increase in the tax on cider. We will not press it to a Division. We merely wish to give the Government an opportunity to tell us, with the benefit of hindsight, what has happened during the past 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). He pointed out that last year's increase was substantial. We are all anxious that the cider industry should not be seriously affected by the increase in tax that the Chancellor has imposed upon it. I understand that the increase this year will amount to about £5 million in a full year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the effect of last year's increase, to learn whether it has caused a reduction in consumption. I believe that the cider industry must be encouraged, because, as my hon. Friend pointed out clearly, many cider industries exist in rural areas where the employment problems are just as bad as, and sometimes even worse than, those in some urban areas. Therefore, we are anxious to ensure that the industry should continue and thrive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a parallel, perhaps I may briefly tell the Committee about a decision that was made last week in the brewing industry in my constituency, and although we are talking primarily about beer and lager, it is a useful parallel to draw. Last week, North Country Breweries disposed of its production facilities and all the pubs and outlets for its beer. The effect is that, according to the statement that has been made—further discussions and negotiations will need to take place on the issue—at least 100 production jobs will be lost in my constituency. I communicated with the managing director of the company and although he was very apologetic he said that the reason was that the company was getting about a 5 per cent. return on capital invested. Although its methods of production in Hull are very traditional, nevetheless, the company requires further capital investment to ensure that the production of its drinks—the same applies to cider—is efficient, which is something that we all accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as we know, money for investment is expensive under this Government. Capital investment is not particularly encouraged, and for the first three years after 1979 investment in industry was very low indeed. When a firm is getting a return on investment of 5 per cent. and needs to borrow at 15 per cent. or whatever, it is clear that the brewing industry can get into severe difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The reason why I drew that valuable parallel was to ask the Minister to explain to us the effect of last year's increases and this year's increases, which, I understand, are still above the rate of inflation, and tell us whether the cider industry will be affected in much the same way as the North Country Breweries' facility in Kingston upon Hull was affected last week, according to the statement that was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most concerned about what has happened as a result of the Chancellor's statement. I feel that it is yet another blow to industry and I am worried because to increase taxation in this way is most serious. It puts more people out of work, causes more closures and forces industry along the path towards big units which employ few people. For some brews, that is fine, but we are talking about traditional brews and not necessarily about productivity. We want to ensure that there is a good quality product and for that reason I am deeply concerned by what the Chancellor said. Therefore, I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Roxburgh and Berwickshire): I support the amendment. It is right that from time to time we should select a change in duty and probe the issue in some depth, although it would be inappropriate and time-consuming to do that for each individual increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me in this instance is the consultations that the Government have had with the industry involved, particularly with those making cider and perry, who generally do not have the sophisticated trade organisations available to help them that some others in the brewing and spirits industries have. Often they have businesses—sometimes family businesses—situated in isolated rural areas. As mentioned by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, (Mr. Davis) if the increases in duty go through without proper consultation, there could be a severe effect on employment. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how the changes will be implemented and what consultations the Government have had with people in the cider and perry industry. It seems a little harsh on cider and perry manufacturers for the Government to increase duty in the way that is proposed, out of the blue—especially in view of last year's increases which seemed to discriminate against the industry. I do not know why the Government seem to have got it in for people making cider and perry; certainly, it is not clear to me why the changes are being made. The Committee should be very careful about passing some of these increases without inquiring into the consequences. Do the Government know what differences in levels of consumption are expected from the increases in duty? That question was also asked by the hon. Member for Hodge Hill and some of his hon. Friends; it is a legitimate question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity given by amendments such as this to examine the important issues behind increases in duty, and I hope that in their reply the Government will address themselves to the consultations leading to the proposed change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). Let us consider the matter from the Government's point of view. We are always being told that central to their strategy is the defeat of inflation; accepting amendment No. I would be a step in the right direction in that respect. There is an onus on them to say why they intend to raise the duty on cider this year. Clearly, many taxes have to rise each year with inflation; in that regard, I believe there should be an indexation system. I realise that it would prevent Chancellors from being able to appear to make many financial concessions at Budget time—although in fact merely preserving the status quo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is slightly anomalous. Last year the Government raised the tax on cider by 3p but raised the tax on beer by only 2p. The increased duty on cider was considerably higher than the rate of inflation. We wish to know whether that had an effect on cider sales. Have they been buoyant, stayed at the same level or fallen—in line with the drop in sales of spirits and beer? Secondly, as the Government raised the tax by more than the rate of inflation last year, they should seriously consider accepting the amendment as a means of attaining their objective of defeating inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The liquor industry faces some problems because of the recession. After all, four or five years ago many people would have gone for a drink at eight o'clock in the evening in a public house or club and probably had three or four pints—whether that was good for them or not is another matter. We are talking about the industry from which the Government get their finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that there is not much money about nowadays. Unemployment is at record levels, and members of the public cannot go out and have three or four pints—they will perhaps go out only once or twice a week and have only one or two pints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must be reflected in the profits of the industry, not only of the whisky indursty. We know that it is having a hard time—it has been given special treatment this year. What is happening about beer, cider and perry? I should like to be assured that the industry will survive. Although the industry may be situated in Tory Members' heartland constituencies, I should not like to see unemployment increase in those constituencies any more than in Labour constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an onus on the Minister to reassure us that the different parts of the industry will be able to survive this recession, and that there will not be redundancies and curtailments simply because we increased the duty on cider and perry last time over and above inflation, and are now increasing it once more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of what Conservative Members say, the recession is so great that I cannot see it lifting in the immediate future. An important consideration is whether the industry will survive. If we accept
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the Government's argument that the defeat of inflation is central to their policy, the amendment would help them on their way. If they will not accept the amendment, I expect a good, cogently argued case from the Minister as to why not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Stoke-on-Trent, Central): In the Budget statement, the Chancellor announced this change in bland and quite tones. He said that this added only 1p on a pint of cider, which does not sound a great deal and which is not a great burden on the industry or on those who drink cider. The Treasury notes show that it will raise only an extra £5 million of revenue in a full year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the notes on clauses show that the duty per hectolitre goes up from £14.28 to £15.80, which seems an increase of well over 10 per cent. That is considerably more than the rate of inflation. The Chancellor said that it was rather more than is required simply to keep pace with inflation. An increase that is almost double the rate of inflation is not " rather more ", but a great deal more. Perhaps the Minister will explain whether he thinks that it is " rather more ", or whether he agrees that it is about a 12 per cent. increase. Could he explain why cider has been picked out for a substantial increase? The Committee would be grateful if he would clarify the Chancellor's statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) have asked the crucial questions about the effect on the industry. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee the state of profitability of the industry, and what were the profit level—or otherwise—of firms such as showerings last year. Perhaps he will also tell the Committee what level of employment we are talking about. We are concerned about the impact of the changes on employment. I am not an expert on the cider industry, so I am not sure whether we are talking about more or fewer than 10,000 people, and whether they are directly or indirectly employed in the industry. Can the Minister also tell us about output and exports and the knock-on effect of falls in consumption?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister also tell us about the agricultural effects? What acreage is under apples and pears? Has there been a decline in the acreage producing apples and pears as a result of last year's increase? Does the Minister have any figures to put before the Committee so that we can see the immediate effects on consumption in pubs and on the industry and the long-term effects on the structure of agriculture in this part of the country? That should be of concern not only to the Committee but to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been asked about consultation. Will he tell us what consultation he has had with the industry and how many representations he has received from the leading companies and trade unions involved? Will he also tell us a little about the Government's long-term policy on duty on cider and perry? We have always understood that cider is liable to duty at a lesser rate than beer, although
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I am not clear whether the duty is half or one-third that on beer. For the benefit of new members of the Committee, perhaps the Minister will clarify the relative duties on beer and cider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also explain—and not just historically—the justification for the differential in duty? Was last year's increase, which was undoubtedly weighted against cider, and this year's substantial increase in duty per hectolitre, part of a move by the Government to equalise the duty on beer and cider? If so, how long do the Government will envisage equalisation of duty taking, and what effect will it have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(Great Grimsby): I apologise to you, Miss Fookes, and even more strenuously to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), who is more of a threat to me, for not being in Committee to hear the tone-setting remarks it is compulsory that I should adopt on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seems eminently sensible, and I get the impression that it is a probing amendment rather than a threat to the Government that will lead us to debate the clause all night tonight. Our probing is in the spirit of scientific inquiry into the effects of duties such as this on consumption and on the industry. It is important that we look at the matter and get accurate and useful figures from the Minister, which we have not had in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members remember last year's imposition of VAT on hot takeaway food, which was previously zero rated. We had bland assurances from Ministers that the effect would be minimal. On the aspect of the industry in which I am most interested—the consumption of fish and chips—the effects were cataclysmic. There was a heavy drop in demand for fish and chips and a serious threat to the viability of many fish and chip shops, which affected Grimsby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give that example not to digress to another subject but to show that the Government approach such matters not in the scientific spirit that we are trying to encourage, but in terms of pure opportunism. They put a little bit on here, a little bit on there and a little bit somewhere else in a desperate dredge for revenues as they attempt to hold the level of direct taxes. The Government pretend that they are reducing taxes but we all know that they are simply spreading the burden. With this measure the Government are spreading the burden on to spirits, beer, wine and cider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should focus on cider, as does the amendment, to help Conservative Members—the serried or huddled masses of silent Members yearning to be free of the Finance Bill Committee at the earliest possible moment. This year, they have a new endeavour as they sit on the Government Benches filling in job, applications, or, in some cases, applications to join the Pimms No. 1 corps—they have to listen to the debate, because their futures are affected by it. In this gigantic adult education class we must inculcate upon the minds of Conservative Members a few scientific facts about the effects of duties of this nature on consumption and on the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
In his Budget Statement, the Chancellor:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"I propose increases which, including VAT, will put between 1p and 2p a pint on most beer, depending on its strength, 1p a pint on cider, "—</p></blockquote>
that is what we are debating here; it is less than the increase last year.
	<br><blockquote><p>"6p on a bottle of table wine and about 10p a bottle on sparkling or fortified wine. In recognition of the current difficulties of the scotch whisky industry "</p></blockquote>—
He might have added,
	<br><blockquote><p>'"In recognition, too, of the drinking preferences of my right hon. and hon. Friends " —</p></blockquote>
"…I propose to increase the duty on spirits by only 10p a bottle, well below the amount needed to keen pace with inflation. [Hon. Members: ' Hear, hear.'] "—[Official Report, 19 March 1985; Vol. 75, c. 799.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Loudly, from Conservative Members, of course. There is no assessment there of the relativities in the mind of the British drinker or in the consumption pattern in public houses and in the home. Is there a substitution factor between beer and cider? What will the effect be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have here a useful test case, bearing in mind the effects of last year's increase duty on cider on consumption, on employment in the industry and on our ability as a cider-producing country to compete with the other cider-producing country in the EEC—France. I hope that the Minister will tell us about those effects, because it is important for us to bear them in mind in balancing the duties year by year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Barney Hay-hoe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to deny the Exchequer revenue from the Budget increase in the duty on cider and perry. As I do not want to have to say " cider and perry " every time, perhaps the Committee will accept that cider duty embraces perry, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the amendment, it would mean that the increase announced by the Chancellor, and which came into effect under the Budget Resolutions, would cease immediately, and the Customs and Excise would have to repay the additional duty that has been collected since the Budget. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) said, the cost of forgoing the increase would be about £5 million in a full year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should view the increase as part of the package of increases that were applied to alcohol. The increase in percentage terms of the duty and the consequential VAT was 10.6 per cent. in the case of cider, and the phrase " rather more than " the rate of inflation was the Chancellor's comment about the duty package as a whole, over all alcohol. There is to be a range. The increase on whisky was much lower, and the increase on beer was about the middle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Viewed in absolute terms, one can compare the approximate increase of 1p on a pint of cider with 1½—between 1p and 2p, depending on the strength—as an increase in the duty on a pint of beer. The alcoholic strengths are about the same—as I said last year, the average cider tends to be a wee bit stronger than the average pint of beer—so, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said, the extra tax per unit of alcohol is not great for cider. In terms of
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
best buys, a lower rate of tax per unit of alcohol is paid on cider than on any other drink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked, very properly, about what happened last year. I was delighted to observe the Opposition's concern for the cider industry, as I recall the swingeing increase which was imposed in 1977—an increase of 3p per pint on a much lower base. The present level of the industry is nearly 50 per cent. higher than it was then. According to the figures that I have received, in 1983, 3,258,000 hectolitres were released for consumption, and last year 3,259,000 were released. In other words, the amounts were broadly similar, and both area substantial increase on the 1977 and 1980 figures. The early 1980s brought a sharp rise in the industry, and the imposition of 3p extra last year has not reversed that trend but has left it on a plateau. Of course we shall be watching to see what happens next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Leyton): It has ground to a halt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it has not gone down, as it did when the party of which the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) is a member increased the charge substantially in percentage terms, a much larger increase than is being proposed this year and significantly larger than last year's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, another dimension, which hon. Members who remember last year's debates will appreciate—the European dimension. I said on 8 May 1984—hon. Members will find this in column 16 of the Official Report that the industry was concerned about the interest being taken in it by the European Commission. Last year, we had to give effect to European rulings about the relationship between the duty on wine and the duty on beer. There has been a danger of the Commission becoming too involved in that relationship, to the disadvantage of the cider industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last year helped to reduce, if not to eliminate, the Commission's interest in that subject, and I hope that what has been done this year will lead to, no revival of that interest. The industry should then be able to continue the good progress which, on average, it has made in recent years. The Chancellor must strike a balance between the amounts of extra tax that he imposes on various parts of the drinks industry. Increases must be looked at in the round. While I accept that the percentage tax increase on cider is higher, it is on a lower base. If we think of it as an absolute tax increase, it is not unreasonable in the context of the other measures in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hodge Hill said that this was a probing amendment intended to establish what had happened on the production front, I hope the information I have given will be of help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwwood) asked about consultations. Last year we heard some powerful speeches in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
House from hon. Members speaking on behalf of the industry, which were referred to during our debates in Committee. The cider industry is well represented by hon. Members with territorial constituency interests in it. I can also tell the hon. Gentleman that Customs and Excise officials have met the National Association of Cider Makers. Liaison is good, and the NACM recognises that if it wishes to contact Customs and Excise officials, particularly on technical matters, the necessary arrangements can quickly be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can never be absolutely certain but I suspect that the NACM breathed a sigh of relief when it heard the Chancellor's proposals, especially in view of what happened last year. Of course the association would have preferred no tax increase, or, indeed, a reduction in tax. But given that it was expecting some increase, I suspect that it was relieved that the increase was less per pint than that in the tax on beer. It has left the ratio relativities very similar and has not raised the spectre of intervention from the EC. I therefore expect the increase to be borne by the industry and not to affect its long-term growth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When Ministers in this Government refer to protecting industries against the ravages of the EEC, Opposition Members know that they are on a winning streak. The Minister of State said that the tax on cider was lower than that on beer. I hope that we shall discuss the tax on beer on clause stand part. The amendment is concerned with cider but I will say that production costs are higher for cider than they are for beer. As I understand it, last year's tax increase has put cider at a higher price than beer, and the two drinks are in competition to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the increase in the cider tax, or rather the imposition of that tax—by the Labour Government in 1976. 1 am sure that he has the figures to hand but let me remind him that that did not prevent a growth in the sale and production of cider—on the contrary. As the Minister said, production is 50 per cent. higher now than it was in 1977. It is therefore clear that the tax has not stopped the boom in cider consumption. The increase in production was especially marked in the early 1980s—there was an increase of 20 per cent. in 1982, followed by an increase of 11 per cent. in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to our probing amendment, the Minister made it clear that last year's tax increase stopped that growth in its tracks. He told us that sales in 1984 were at about the same level as they had been in 1983. So although the Minister did not exactly dress in a white sheet and put ashes on his head, he more or less accepted responsibility for what had happened in the industry, which is now stable at best. We all know that one either goes forward or one goes down. Industries do not stay in the same condition, and a static level of sales is bad news for the cider industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand I was heartened by the Minister's acceptance of pleas from my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Randall) and myself on behalf of the cider and perry industries. The Minister for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and himself admits that cider is the best buy. One cannot really do better than the best, but perry is better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament are becoming increasingly conscious of the need to conserve the countryside. Anyone who drives through Herefordshire or Worcestershire will agree that the orchards look much better than the hopfields. I have the support of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, who no doubt drives through his constituency and neighbouring constituencies. I make no apology for saying that that should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we shall compare this year's tax increase with those on other drinks on clause stand part. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister of State would take the opportunity to explain the details of the increase in tax on one type of drink compared with the inerease in tax on another type of drink. The figures that I have obtained show that the increase in the tax on cider is 10.6 per cent., whereas the increase on wine is 8.3 per cent., on beer 7.5 per cent., on vermouth and sherry 7.3 per cent. and on spirits 1.9 per cent. I am sure that the Minister would confirm those figures, as he provided them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the relatively small increase on the tax on whisky, I believe that the tax applies to other drinks because they are all classed as spirits. Therefore, although the Chancellor did not exactly make the point during his Budget statement, it means that there is a low increase in the tax on drinks such as gin, vodka and other spirits, some of which are imported and some of which are made in this country. As one of my hon. Friends reminds me, the Budget package includes a small increase in the tax on brandy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister of State explain how the Government came to their conclusions about how much tax to put on the different drinks? I should have expected the rate to be broadly the same in each category. The spread is very wide. It starts at 1.9 per cent. on spirits, which can be justified in the case of the whisky industry. I am not sure that the increase should be so small for other spirits but I accept that it may not be possible to have a different rate on whisky as opposed to other spirits. Nevertheless, the spread is from 1.9 per cent. on spirits up to 10.6 per cent. on cider, with most increases being around the 8 per cent. mark. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how the Government came to their conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, do the Government pay any attention to the effect on health? There is growing concern about alcoholism and the abuse of alcohol in this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
country. I speak as someone who enjoys an occasional drink; I find that as I get older it becomes more pleasant as other pleasures become less frequent. An occasional drink consoles me in the face of the vicissitudes of politics. However, there is a serious point here. Do the Government take into account such matters in their consideration of the size of an increase in tax in a Budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Chancellor has increased the rates of duty considerably above inflation, whatever he may say, the clause can only be described as a kill-joy clause by a kill-joy Government. Once again the Government—and previous Governments have possibly been guilty of this too—are increasing taxes on the pleasures of drink. Those pleasures are generally very innocent. That is certainly so for all members of the Committee. Many people throughout the country will feel that once again they have been got at by the Government and that their small pleasures will now be taxed to the extra amount of £175 million. Perhaps the many thousands of people who read Hansard will remember when they next spend money in their off licence or pub that they are unnecessarily being taxed over the rate of inflation by the Government. Part of the money they pay for their next pint results from the desire of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to see their pleasure and leisure time taxed more heavily than straight valorisation or indexation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be hard put to it not to stand there like a pious Puritan saying, " The changes are good for you and they will be good for the Treasury ". They certainly will not increase the amount of pleasure and enjoyment in the world. In that sense, the Government are, for most people, a kill-joy Government and these are kill-joy increases in taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said, the Government could, if they were even more disingenuous than I trust the Minister of State will be—he is always the soul of probity—claim that they are making these changes for the good of the country. They could claim health reasons, concern for youth and fear of alcoholism. They could say they are increasing the rates of duty as a deterrent. The Government are keen on the deterrent theory. I wonder whether the Minister of State intends to introduce the drink deterrent theory. It would, however, be less than straightforward for him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument to be made on deterrence. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton,(Sir G. Young) has, with some courage and determination., made the case on tobacco duties. No doubt we shall come to those, but I doubt whether the Minister will try to make a similar case on drink tonight. Alcoholism among young people is a growing and serious problem; it slides into drug abuse and glue sniffing. If the Government want to tackle increases in those abuses among the young they should not do so by the crude, catchall deterrent method—though I suspect that is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
what they are doing tonight—but by spending more on health education, and on publicity in schools and colleges about the effects of drink. They should offer counselling services throughout the country, and as a longer-term solution, they should provide prospects for jobs for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to stretch the debate too wide, Miss Fookes, but it younger people are driven in their teeens to drink and other abuses, it is because they see little respect offered to them by society and by the Government, nor much hope for the future. Why should they not turn to something to make them forget their present state, their prospects for employment and the conditions of their cities? I believe that I am not going too wide in suggesting that those are connected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that the Minister will not be so disingenuous as to put forward health arguments. I suspect that we will find that once again the Government have gone in for the easy, lazy taxation target. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget Statement, should not have quietly slipped out—ironic and misplaced cheers from his supporters—the fact that he was increasing duties by little more than inflation, and on spirits by a little less. An honest Chancellor—heaven knows we do not have such a person—[Interruption] I use the word in the sense of straightforward and straight talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor should have said,	<br><blockquote><p> " Members of the public, we need the money. Once again, you mugs who like to have a drink are an easy target and this is a quick, easy and relatively painless way for the Treasury to milk you yet again for a bit of extra taxation. Nobody will notice and we will be the richer; you will be the poorer. I am doing this because far from being a reforming Chancellor I am totally intellectually exhausted. I cannot cope with my job. I cannot think of more original or inventive form of taxation. I cannot be bothered to distingush between the different drinks that I am taxing. Here is a catch-all increase that will make it easy for me and my officials to get an extra £175 million, and because you as members of the public are so inured to tax increases, you expect them every March in the Budget, and you will forgive me for this one, I know."</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor could and should have said " Give me the money. You won't notice it. I need it. ", but unfortunately, he was not so straightforward. The Chancellor's claim to be an intellectually rigorous, reforming and imaginative Chancellor collapse around him, not only through his Budget Statement, but particularly in this seemingly innocent, straightforward and not very controversial clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill, put it so neatly, if the Chancellor claims to favour spirits because of the state of the whisky industry in Scotland, he should realise that a Chancellor with a little more intellectual rigour and analysis could have seen that he was actually giving an enormous trade advantage to imported alcohol and liquor and to foreign brand names. Can the Minister say
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
what the balance of trade on spirits is? How many foreign imports will benefit from the Chancellor's relatively favourable treatment of spirits such as foreign vodka and brandy, and other imported liqueurs and spirits, in relation to his attempt to give some relief to the Scottish whisky industry? In attempting not to harm spirits he has probably clobbered the drinks industry even more by giving yet another subsidy to imported drinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Easy taxes can be imposed by the Chancellor and once again here is one on pleasure. It would come as a pleasant change from a Chancellor who, claims to be a reforming Chancellor and stands before us on Budget day as the physical embodiment of the bon viveur who has enjoyed himself greatly at the table, no doubt with the glass—he usually tells the breathlessly awaiting press what he has had for lunch on Budget day—if he were a little more inventive about ways of raising taxation and took a little less of a joyless approach to life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot claim that a Labour Chancellor would take such a line, but I can only hope that when my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill is Chief Secretary, as I hope he soon will be, he will bear that in mind. It would be nice if a Government had the courage to, say that pleasure and enjoyment are not bad and that tax on drink will be slightly reduced in future. When the Minister replies to those points, I hope that he can bring a little joy into our lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Burnley): I should like to, follow the line that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) is pursuing. I share his concern in wanting to help the whisky industry in Scotland. We all recognise its importance to the Scottish economy and I do not wish to do anything that would be detrimental to it, but by increasing the duty by only 10p a bottle, the Chancellor is also assisting the makers of brandy, vodka, gin and other spirits. That cannot be justified. However, I would not argue against even that aspect because, like my hon. Friend, I do not wish to tax too heavily the pleasures of ordinary people who want to go out in the evening and have a drink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that the Government had had the same regard for the beer industry and had recognised the financial difficulties now faced by many with licensed premises and the massive reduction in job opportunities caused by reduced consumption of beer. In most licensed premises now, business is slack. Moreover, in constituencies such as mine, many clubs are finding it extremely difficult to survive. Many have had to reduce the number of people that they employ. They had to do so if they were to keep their doors open and remain in business. As well as being anxious about the whisky trade in Scotland, we should have some anxiety about the breweries and licensed premises throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the licensed trade—certainly in areas such as mine and probably in most areas—licensed premises rely on their beer trade. Until I was elected to a Member of Parliament, I served as a committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
member for one of the clubs in my constituency. The club would break even if we put a 331 per cent. mark up on the price of beer delivered from the breweries. That was our bread and butter. The icing on the cake came from the spirits, which formed a much smaller percentage of the total turnover. The higher percentage mark-up on beer could yield a slightly bigger profit. Moreover, of course, soft drinks provide the biggest profit yield in the licensed trade. At times the mark-up is outrageous. An enormous additional charge can be made for a splash of lemonade or orange squash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that licensed premises can sell sufficient beer to survive. We must recognise that the bulk sales in this country come from beer and that by putting 2p a pint on beer the largest number of people is affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one regret. When visiting one or two clubs and public houses in my constituency at the weekend, I noticed how many customers were complaining that the price of beer had increased by 3p, not by 2p a pint. In most instances, the landlords' answered by saying that the Government had put on 2p in the Budget, but that VAT must be added, so they needed another 0.15p The Financial Secretary shakes his head. I know why he does so. The 2p increase includes VAT. Nevertheless, many people in the trade are pulling a fast one on their own customers and damaging their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor of the Exchequer clearly said that the 1p and 2p a pint included VAT, as did the increases on spirits and other alcohol. But the fact remains. Indeed, I was surprised at the number of people who commented about it last week. I think that they did so, perhaps, because they were Bill aware that I would be speaking on the Finance this week. They were worried about the matter. Those people believed that the increase was 2p plus an extra bit for VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we get a Labour Government we shall wish to ensure that the blame will not be put on that Labour Government. As the next Labour Government will take office in only just over two years, we wish to ensure that the legislation clearly shows the people exactly what the Government are doing, and also to ensure that that Government do not get the blame when landlords and licensees perhaps abuse the system by taking a little more than they are entitled to take.

I am genuinely concerned about the reduction of trade in the licenced industry at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a certain background murmering, chiefly on the hon. Member's own side.

	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I am worried about the reduction of trade. The Government should say that enough is enough; they should not tax people's pleasures any more but hold the status quo for a couple of years.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
so on—which depend on the sale of alcoholic drinks, and of the jobs of those who make the drinks as well as protect people's pleasures. We have just discussed a probing amendment on the manufacture of cider, when we tried to find out what effect there had been on employment prospects, so I am following that theme in expressing my concern about beer, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to whisky in his Budget speech. We have covered the three main arms of the licenced trade, excluding wine. We have a duty to protect jobs, and anything which would have an adverse effect on job opportunities must be undesirable and should be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Hirst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Strathkelvin and Bearsden): I cannot let the debate pass without expressing my satisfaction, as a Scottish Member of Parliament, at the fair treatment which the Scottish whisky industry has received in this year's Budget. Hon. Members who served in the Committee last year will recall perhaps that I tabled amendments seeking relief for the industry because it had been fairly hard hit in last year's Budget changes, such as the withdrawal of stock relief and a postponed system of accounting for value added tax and, indeed, the more exacting tolerances which bad been introduced the previous year by the Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my right hon. Friends could not accede to my amendments last year, but I place on record my appreciation that although the Minister of State was very busy, he received a delegation from a major Scottish whisky distiller and undertook to consider carefully the matters that were raised with great conviction at that meeting. He said that he would give the most careful thought to the points that had been made to see whether it was possible to bring forward reliefs in this year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be said that there is great appreciation in the industry of the modest increase in duty. That should not pass unremarked or, indeed, without gratitude being expressed in the Committee. However, the industry has a grievance this year which is perhaps not of direct interest to members of the Committee, although I am glad that Treasury Ministers have galloped to the relief of the industry and many other ratepayers in Scotland. I refer, of course, to the effect of revaluation which caused serious problems in the Scotch whisky industry. I know that the distillers will be massively encouraged by the relief which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland announced in the House this afternoon. I hope that those distillers will contrast that generous and substantial relief with the rather less adequate relief which was urged by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that he will be reading our proceedings with the vigour with which he participated in our proceedings in previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to comment on the relationship between the consumption of beer and the closure of pubs and the price of beer. I do so because of the most recent decision by Scottish and Newcastle breweries to launch a takeover for Matthew Brown brewers in the north west. There was an engaging struggle between all parties concerned and between Members of the House. There was all-party support for the Director General of Fair Trading to recommend to the Minister that the matter be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made a wise and informed decision to refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It was hoped that the commission would rule the takeover bid out of order because the Scottish and Newcastle group had failed to give adequate undertakings by Matthew Brown, to the northern brewing industry generally and to the great number of small pubs in the north west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is about small pubs. Their future is dependent upon the price of beer and on how many barrels they can sell. The Scottish and Newcastle group was proposing to take over a brewery with 550 outlets in the north west, of which 200 were in the county of Cumbria. Out of that 200, 100 sold fewer than five barrels of beer a week. It is the policy of Scottish and Newcastle breweries to close pubs which sell fewer than five barrels a week—as far as we can detect. We detected that because we have been able to identify 16 pubs in the north of England which were closed because they had sold insufficient barrels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor referred in his statement to increasing excise duties
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"by rather more than is required simply to keep pace with inflation "</p></blockquote>.—[Official Report, 19 March 1985; Vol. 75, c. 799.]
The right hon. Gentleman was instituting a policy which further prevented the retention of small pubs throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Chancellor takes such decisions, he should at least consult, particularly when so many jobs are at stake. It is not only jobs in the distribution of beer but those jobs in breweries which will be affected. When launching the bid, the Scottish and Newcastle group refused to give undertakings on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
the future of the two breweries in Carlisle and Workington. The group refused to give those undertakings because of forecasts about the consumption of beer in various parts of the United Kingdom. The group felt that the demand for beer was insufficient, as a result of price rises and tax increases, for it to be able to give those undertakings. the demand for beer was insufficient, resulting from price rises and tax increases, to give those undertakings. Therefore, there are clear job implications in decisions taken by the Chancellor to increase revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view of a representative of the Brewers Society was that:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Chancellor had again penalised beer at more than twice the rate of inflation. 'It is unfair to over 30 million beer drinkers who have had excessive tax increases in every year since 1979,' said a spokesman. 'It is the longest run of heavy beer tax increases on record '."</p></blockquote>
That is a statement from someone who works in an industry which is a friend of the Conservative party. We all know that that industry makes substantial contributions at election time, and at other times, to the Conservative party, but there is obvious discord. I wonder to what extent there has been consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know from reading The Guardian diary this morning that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) was last week addressing in Leeds the Federation of Conservative Students. I am told that that federation, which has militant tendencies at times, has strong views on those matters. We all know how strongly the hon. Lady feels about issues which affect her constituents and, particularly, Conservative students. Indeed, they are so strong, that, according to The Guardian diary report, she burst into a studio in Radio Leeds and demanded that her voice be transmitted to the people of Yorkshire on those matters. Instead of the transmission being for the benefit uniquely of the citizens of Yorkshire, Lancashire and those who listen to that radio station, perhaps the hon. Lady would care today to enlighten the Committee about the views expressed to her by the militant tendency members of the Federation of Conservative Students, because they are large consumers of beer. I believe, that their interests should be fully represented during the course of our proceedings today. I hope that the hon. Lady does not side step the possibility of being heard. It is known that she does not normally side step such an opportunity, and I feel sure that she will take the opportunity provided to her today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has the Chancellor's ear and the ear of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, whose seat now ventures on to the list of Labour marginals. Equally, in the new conditions of Labour gains in the south-east, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury will want to be heard on those matters. He has many constituents who are large consumers of beer and who will want to know what his personal position is in relation to beer consumption within his region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beer consumption is a matter which draws strong and enlightened response from my hon. Friends in that it is very much the stuff of trade and conversation within our constituencies. I hope that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Minister will address himself to the implications in decisions taken on increasing excise duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Stretford): I refer briefly to the speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) who addressed himself to come central points, which I hope to develop. Tax increases have had a serious impact on brewing and licensed trade premises over the past few years. Dramatic changes have occurred which are mainly detrimental to the ultimate consumer because of the position in which the industry now finds itself. I make no complaint about the treatment of spirits in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst), in making complimentary comments about the Budget, wishes to rise to the dizzy heights of PPS prior to losing his seat at the next general election. His, too, is on the list of marginal seats. I am sure that the Minister of State will pass that on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no criticism about spirits because, while I recognise that one of the reasons is the intense pressure applied by the distilling lobby through people such as the hon. Gentleman, I recognise, too, that the Government have listened to the distillers because they are major contributors to the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that the Government would recognise the problems not only of the beer manufacturing industry—tha industry also makes a significant contribution to the Conservative party—but of the customers, who are ordinary people, represented in Parliament by my colleagues. Those people have suffered under this Budget and under previous Budgets. One needs only to go into a public house or into any licensed premises in my constituency, the city of Manchester or the north-west of England, in general, to find that pubs are empty for a large part of the evening or during the day when previously there would have been an active trade.

The clubs sector has been very badly mauled by the increase in prices—especially the increase in duty over recent years. Many clubs find it extremely difficult to operate successfully and simply to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many clubs and organisations in the north west of England, such as Labour clubs and working men's clubs, do not operate as profit-making organisations. Very often they simply plough back their profits in the interests of the members. I can think of many clubs not far from my home in which the whole emphasis is to provide a dignified recreation for ordinary working people. Even in the 1980s, that is not an ignoble ambition. Those clubs find it increasingly difficult to exist and to attract customers, even though the beer may be cheaper because they cater for the poorest and most vulnerable in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts of my constituency have up to 50 per cent. adult male unemployment. One has only to consider the economics of that situation to recognise that disposable income—especially that discretionary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
income which would be spent on the consumption of alcohol—has been hit very badly. It does not take a genius to recognise that we have gone far beyond the point where the economist would talk about an inelastic demand, because the Government have proved that demand, even for the most inelastic commodity will, in the final analysis, prove to be elastic and pubs will simply cease to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were cynical about the process, I might accuse the Government of taking action deliberately to affect those areas which contain the clubs. The contrast would be with those up-market organisations which are products of the south east. Admittedly, in the centre of Manchester there are wine and spirit bars, but they are at less of a disadvantage than are those which sell beer. Whether it is intentional or not, the Budget has brought about a massive redistribution in respect of alcohol, and the poor have suffered. The relatively better off have managed to escape unscathed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the sale of spirits is not unimportant in working men's clubs. For that reason, I do not urge the Minister to make any changes in those provisions, although I recognise that they suck in imports and, ironically in my constituency, which has a large Irish population, they suck in Irish whiskey but not necessarily Scotch whisky. That is a fact of life. It is about consumer choice, and we should not regret it. However, it damages clubs and public houses in poorer areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall develop the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). It is right to say that the provision hits at smaller pubs belonging to a marginal brewery and the smaller free house in a rural area. In the cities, it is the clubs which suffer. The clubs are important because they have the historical role of maintaining sales outlets for the smaller breweries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has mentioned Matthew Brown's brewery in Blackburn, and there are dozens of smaller breweries in the north west of England. In my constituency, Hyde's brewery is tiny by comparison with national standards, but it is important locally for employment reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality of the problem in my area is that the clubs and pubs will come under pressure. The marginal breweries such as Hyde's—not that individually; it would be unfair to cast ill luck upon it as a trader—will find themselves in difficulties. The net result is that in a period of retrenchment in the brewing industry we find that there is a concentration of large successful multiples. The historical trend is enhanced, almost deliberately, by the fecklessness and irresponsibility of a Government, who are not prepared to accept beer as anything other than their money box, and who refuse to recognise that in coming back constantly to syphon off from the barrels of my constituents in that industry what they regard as their excess to fund public spending they are reaching a point where they are killing off the industry that has sustained them for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is logic in proposing that we take a different view of the industry. We would be greatly informed by the Minister of State telling us not only
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
what the national effect has been on employment and output in the brewing industry but what the regional impact has been. If I had the chance to leave the Committee this evening and visit a pub in central London, I would find that it—and others—were still full. I invite the Minister of State to come, 'to some of the pubs in the north of England—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Make sure that he pays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would make sure that he did. [An hon. Member: " The Ministerial salary would warrant it."] Yes, his ministerial salary would warrant it, but I understand that the Minister of State is a man of extreme generosity, and I am hoping to confirm that later this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister of State came to the north of England, he would see for himself the massive difference in trading in pubs between that region and London. This concerns ordinary people greatly because, once again, the institutions run and used by ordinary people are being hit. This is no trivial exercise. We are talking of a matter of deep importance to the community that we represent. The Government have got it wrong, but we hope that that will not continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity to tell the Government that I do not think that they have considered fully the problems facing the Scotch whisky industry. I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst), who presented the idea that the industry revelled in the Budget announcements and were whooping with joy. That is not the information at my disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have imposed duty which discriminates slightly in favour of the industry, and we ought to be thankful for small mercies. But small they are. The Government have not investigated thoroughly the state of the industry. That is clear from the provisions in this part of the clause. They should have examined four major areas far more closely in assessing the appropriate rate of duty for the industry for this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A higher proportion of excise duty on whisky still means that it is in an unfair position when competing against beer and wine. The industry's argument would be that duty on whisky should not have been increased this year, and I think that the argument is valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be fairer in the longer term for the Government to state clearly how they intended to handle excise duty. I submit that it would be more logical and sensible for the Government to move progressively towards taxing alcoholic content at a flat rate per centilitre of alcohol. I do not mean that they should clobber beer by duty compared with that imposed on whisky at present, but it is not unreasonable to expect the Government over the coming years to reconcile and redress the existing disadvantage. At present, spirits are taxed almost twice as heavily as beer and table wines and, although some reduction of that discrimination in the Budget was welcome, it does not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
If we consider the present duty on normal measures of alcoholic beverages each containing the same amount of alcohol, we find that one half pint of beer brings in about 9.04p, three and a half ounces of imported table wine generates 9.75p, two ounces of imported sherry generates 11.08p, and one ounce of Scotch whisky generates 17.90p. In the market circumstances that now prevail, the Scotch whisky industry cannot continue to carry such discriminatory excise duties. When the Minister winds up, I should like him to tell us whether the Government are prepared to commit themselves to re- dressing balance in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of the clause that surprises me is the way in which duty deferment has been handled. According to my information, the consultations that the Government had with the industry revealed that the distilling sector working group that looked into this problem made urgent representations which it seemed to think had been taken into account by the Government in relation to the duty deferment issue when arriving at their Budget proposals. The case that it made for extending the duty deferment from an average of four weeks to six weeks should have been taken into account when assessing the level of duty imposed by clause 1. It is unfair and the industry will suffer directly as a result. We may return to this matter later in our deliberations. I am worried about the continuing impact on the industry of the changes that were made last year on the withdrawal of stock relief. That should have been taken into account, and now that the new scheme has been in operation for 12 months, the rate of excise duty this year should have reflected the changes in stock relief that have been suffered by the industry. Indeed, as was predicted, they have had a most serious effect on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that there is a unique legal requirement for the industry to hold stocks of whisky for several years and that renders it especially vulnerable to high levels of inflation. No other major United Kingdom manufacturing industry matches the stock to output ratio of the Scotch whisky industry. The effects of last year's capital allowances changes should have been reflected more accurately in the duty levels. The withdrawal of stock relief increased the industry's liability for corporation tax by an estimated £30 million in 1984-85, £17 million in 1985-86 and by £6 million in 1986-87, compared with a total tax liability of £105 million in 1983-84. Therefore, the effective increase in corporation tax is higher than that for any other industry. That should have been reflected in the increase in duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of profitability is too low. The post-tax return is below 3 per cent. in real terms and that is a very dangerous level. The effective rate of corporation tax, even at 35 per cent., is much higher for companies in the Scotch whisky sector than in other industrial sectors. Were those facts taken into account when the duty for Scotch whisky was decided? If the Minister says that the measures are transitional and that it will all work out in the wash, I must tell him that the calculations by the industry show that it will take until the end of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
century for the gains from the lower corporation tax to offset the losses in the transitional period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the proposition that alcohol should be taxed per cc on any drink. That would mean large changes in the amount of whisky bought across the bar compared with beer. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could give us a comparison of the price of a tot of whisky and half a pint of beer under such a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that we should have a system of indexation, and over a long period redress the imbalance against the whisky industry. I appreciate that drastic changes would be needed, but I do not propose that such a policy be adopted immediately. The industry has to think in the long term, and to give it confidence in the future the Government should say that they will progressively redress the existing imbalance and positively discriminate in favour of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter to which the Government have not paid enough attention in trying to assess the level of duty on whisky is the urgent need for the industry to promote overseas markets. It is now facing great competition and needs help. That can be given only if the industry receives proper treatment in respect of the rates of duty imposed on whisky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rates revaluation is not strictly a matter for this Committee but I believe that the financial impact of the rates revaluation in Scotland may not have been considered by the Treasury in its discussions with the whisky industry on the appropriate levels of duty to be set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman proposing a different tax regime for Scotch whisky from all the other drinks covered by the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not. I feel that there is discrimination against whisky and other spirits, which should be put right in the fullness of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for rates revaluation, the Secretary of State for Scotland has only this afternoon been addressing himself to some of the effects visited on commerce and industry north of the border. The Scotch Whisky Association calculates that the revaluation has on average increased the amount paid in rates on distilleries and warehouses by 36 per cent. The increases vary widely across the country, being as much as 82 per cent. in Orkney, 75 per cent. in the Lowlands and 41 per cent. on Speyside. Such excessive demands are made on the basis that distilleries are working to capacity, whereas average production in the industry is only about 56 per cent. Scotland's leading export industry—about £931 million-worth in 1984—has to face those rates increases while at the same time being discriminated against by the Government's duties on its products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the calculations were based on the whisky industry working to full capacity. Has he any evidence of that, or is it merely contained in the brief that he has been given?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) wil bear with me, I shall give him the evidence. Scottish Malt Distilleries had at 31 March 1985 ceased production at 10 of its 34 distilleries. We are considering whether the industry as a whole is operating at full capacity. I believe that it is in bad shape, that it is not working at anything like full capacity, and that plants are being shut left, right and centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Leeds, Central): Perhaps 10 out of the 34 plants are being closed to concentrate production on the 24 plants, so that those plants may be working to full capacity in a smaller market. Can the hon. Gentleman prove that that is not so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information comes from the industry. However, I am more concerned about the loss of jobs that has resulted from the Government's policies than about statistics. The industry is working at about 50 per cent. capacity. The Government should have considered that when levying the rate of duty in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list of closures spans the whole of the north of Scotland from Nairn, Morayshire, Banffshire, Stonehaven, Alness, Elgin, Inverness, Mulken, Glendullan and Linkwood distilleries—Linkwood is particularly close to my heart as it produces my favourite malt whisky. I recommend it in place of the traditional champagne as part of the celebrations at the end of this Committee. It is unfair that we should discriminate against the Scottish industry by drinking champagne at the end of these Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many factors, such as the revaluation issue, have come to light recently and been put to the Government by the industry. Although we recognise that the duty could have been higher, and that there has been a slight mitigation of the increases that have been proposed in other areas, have the Government taken all those factors into account?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry may be able to show over the next 12 months that what it has been saying about the dire effects of these changes on the profitability and level of employment in some of the worst affected areas of the highlands of Scotland is true. If so, will the Government discriminate positively in future on the rates of duty imposed on Scotch whisky?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be called so early in our proceedings, and to follow the Liberal representative, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I am surprised at the tone of his speech. Given the Liberal party's tremendous commitment to driving standards, I should have thought that Liberal Members would take the opportunity to argue for even greater taxes on drink to persuade people not to drink and drive. I am sure that any decent school of motoring would provide people with that basic information before taking their driving tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted not just to follow the Liberal Member but to serve on this Committee. I have heard on many occasions, Miss Fookes, about the qualities and attributes of your chairmanship. I am sure that the Committee's work will flow with great speed and rapidity partly as a result of your chair
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
manship, and so I am looking forward to learning from you and to seeing in practice those attributes and characteristics about which my hon. Friends have waxed so eloquent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. One of those characteristics is a rather irritating tendency to want hon. Members to stick to, the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Miss Fookes, I was trying to do that. However, it would have been remiss of me not to have made that brief, passing reference before moving on to the issues in front of us. I am pleased to serve on the Committee. My hon. Friends have drawn attention to the lively debate by Conservative Members. I served briefly on the Local Government Bill earlier this year and I was distressed that Conservative Members did not join in the full spirit of the debate. We seemed to go many evenings and nights without hearing from Conservative Members. I came to the Committee today expecting that early in our debates Conservative Members would join in and make substantial and intellectual points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) tried to bait the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) into early action when he referred to her visit to my constituency in Leeds yesterday. The hon. Lady sent me and my hon. Friend a note. I was delighted that she went to Leeds. My constituency is a safe Labour seat. If the hon. Lady wants to use her activities for the best advantages of the Labour party I can provide a list of seats where she would be much more useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has been stimulating and I want to continue on the theoretical level. I am sure that as the Committee progresses many of the basic tenets of monetarism will be explained to us. We shall challenge them with our views of Keynesian and neo-Keynesian doctrines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing is clear—we may have those tenets explained but, if the truth were told, more than half Conservative Members do not believe in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman continues, may I say that I do not want a general debate about conflicting economic theories. Let us deal with clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you are right, Miss Fookes. I do not want to start that sort of seminar discussion because the Committee is not the right place for it. Perhaps when the Minister takes up his earlier invitation to visit the north of England he may wish to regale some smoke room or tap room with the basic principles of monetarism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been pointed out, the principles of taxation relate directly to our basic political philosophy. Clause 1 is central to that debate, but I am not prepared to go down that road to a more central discussion when you, Miss Fookes, say that it would be inappropriate. We can leave such a discussion to later.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
My hon. Friends referred to elasticity of demand and said with great rigour that taxes on wines and spirits would increase beyond the level of inflation. The Chancellor's inflation predictions suggest that the taxation increase will not be much more than the level of inflation by the end of this year. I imagine that the rate of inflation will be much higher than it is now. My hon. Friends are saying that the tax increase is above the rate of inflation, which will affect the demand for beer and other products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's argument is crucial to the debate. When the Minister replies, he must bear in mind that we should examine taxation in both a general and a specific sense, relating the impact of a particular tax on a particular industry. My hon. Friends have been saying that the decline in demand for beer concentrates the sale of beer into fewer public houses. I can speak with expertise because I spent several years of my childhood in a pub as the son of a publican. So I have some sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6. 30pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have said that the concentration of the industry into fewer public houses has brought in its train the concentration of the industry into fewer breweries. There has been a concentration of production and a concentration of capital in this industry. That is bad in terms of consumer choice, consumer preference and employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reply to the strong argument that has been made by my hon. Friends because in our view, the taxes on bear, in particular, will lead to a further loss of jobs and a further decline in choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government claim that they are committed to competition, but their taxation policy is reducing competition and creating an even greater oligopoly. In the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington, they are wiping out long established firms, such as Matthew Brown, which may lose their separate identities. They are taking away from consumers the opportunity to buy particular types of beer. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reply to this debate in much greater detail than he did last year. I have the report of the proceedings of Standing Committee A last year. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)--unfortunately, he is not a members of the Finance Committee this year, and I am sure that he will be missed by many people—raised what is a crucial issue. No doubt, Miss Fookes, if you were in the Chair at the time, you will remember his words:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"I come from a beer-drinking area."</p></blockquote>
No one could deny that about south Yorkshire, although there may have been recent difficulties in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my village people now ask for a drink called a snake bite".</p></blockquote>
There is nothing exotic about the snake bite. It does not involve any colonial misgivings on the part
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
of the people of south Yorkshire. My hon. Friend went on to explain that a snake bite
	<br><blockquote><p>"consists of half a pint of best bitter ... and half a pint of cider."</p></blockquote>
He spent time on the point, because he was worried about what would happen to the price of his pint of snake bite in the clubs of Rother Valley, as a result of the differential taxes on the various types of drinks. The Minister who replied on that occasion, and I am sure that he will reply again today, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am not sure whether I should venture down the snake-bite trail "</p></blockquote>.—[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 8 May 1984; c. 22-29.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the reply that we expect from a Minister, and I hope that this year he will do better. I hope that this Committee will not have to suffer the venom of the snake-bite trail, and that we shall have answers to our general and specific questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister a couple of questions about the total percentage increase on the various drinks. The Customs and Excise briefing note No. 992, dated 19 March, says that there will be a total increase in revenue of £180 million from all these changes. I want to know the percentage increase. It may be somewhere in the paper, but I have not found it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) by the Minister of State on 23 April, there is a list showing the various increases. I see that there is a 10.6 per cent. increase in cider, 8.3 per cent. increase in sparkling wine, 8.3 per cent. increase in table wine, and 7.5 per cent. increase in beer. There are others, too port 6.3 per cent. and spirits 1.9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) made a passionate speech on behalf of the Scottish whisky industry. I appreciate that that industry has particular problems, which may be why the Chancellor has increased the tax on spirits by only 1.9 per cent. But the 7.5 per cent increase on beer is above the current rate of inflation, and certainly above that envisaged in the Government's medium-term financial strategy. Having snatched free milk from the school kids, the Government are now snatching the working man's pint in the pubs and clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members may say that that is overdramatic. But I have talked to a number of publicans in my constituency who run small back-street pubs, and they are having a very difficult time. I commented on this briefly last year, and, following last year's Bill, I managed, after appealing, to obtain rate rebates for some of those publicans. Rates for public houses are based not only on the property but on the barrelage as well, and I was able to obtain those rebates because of the bad time that many publicans were having. They told me that because they could not afford the staff necessary to help support a public house, they had to work very long hours; they had to wash up and do all the cleaning, and they could not afford holidays. Many publicans in Kingston upon Hull were formerly in the fishing industry and used redundancy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
money to set up on their own. Now they are having a very tough time indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should be congratulated on having arranged those rebates for publicans in his constituency. I hope that as a result they will vote for him in the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend note, however, that the Government have set their face against water rate rebates? There are rebates for those who sell booze, but not for those who subsist on water. Is that not inequitable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suggest that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) does not follow his hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) down that path, as he would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always take your advice on these matters, Miss Fookes. I would not dare to counter your instructions. I understand my hon. Friend's feelings, but to respond to them might, as you suggest, be a little wide of the mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me mention some of the other figures that we have received. In Customs and Excise press notice No. 992, dated 19 March, I see on the notes to the editor's page that the additional revenue received by the Exchequer as a result of the extra yield from VAT will amount to about £120 million in a full year. That is a very large sum, about twice as much as the land development grant that we discussed on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Committee, we are always faced with the problem of priorities. Two days ago on the Floor of the House, the Government gave £50 million to property speculators and developers—quite a contrast with the extra £120 million that they are imposing on beer. There is no point in ducking the issue: we know that most beer drinkers fall into social categories C2, D and E. If Conservative Members like to give me figures to disprove that, I shall willingly sit down, but I assure them that it is the case. I imagine that most of the property speculators to whom we referred on the Floor of the House are not C2s, Ds and Es; they are all As or large institutions. My point is that we could have used the £50 million to help the brewing and retail outlets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the massive 10-6 per cent. increase in tax on cider. My constituents are mainly beer drinkers and, to a lesser extent, cider drinkers, and I feel that they have been penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that some of my publicans were having a very difficult time. That can be linked with the recent decision of North Country Breweries to sell off all the retail outlets and the production facilities in my constituency. That has resulted partly from the decline in consumption. Undoubtedly one major factor is the high level of unemployment. In West Hull, male unemployment is 20.6 per cent. Unemployed people cannot afford to go out and have their usual pint at half-past nine in the evening. Publicans have told me that instead they have to save up the money for the half pint that they would normally drink each night so that they can have three or four pints and enjoy themselves on a Friday evening. That is a serious situation. I shall not
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
discuss the disastrous effect of the Government's economic policy and strategy on employment. We know that it is part and parcel of that strategy to keep unemployment up, and my constituents will continue to suffer as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason why consumption has dropped is that, during their six years in office, the Government have increased their revenue from beer. That has made it more difficult for people to afford to drink it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to alcoholism. We are saying that the industry is in a bad state and that we want to ensure that production workers—for example, the 100 people in my constituency who lost their jobs last week—are protected. We want to encourage social drinking. I enjoy social drinking and I have no drink problems, but some people do. A recent report indicated that young people are affected and that alcoholism in schools is especially serious. We must take that on board. One cannot see the matter in black and white, but I feel that it should be dealt with by education rather than by fiddling around with revenues.

The report showed that the young people did not realise that there was the same amount of alcohol in a small glass of whisky as in a larger glass of beer; they thought that the smaller drink must contain less alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of information should be taken into account when we assess whether we are encouraging people to drink alcohol by ensuring that the increases do not reach the phenomenal levels suggested in the letter from the Minister of State to my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider whether there are any other ways in which the small, back-street pubs could increase their revenues. We know that several options are open to those whose businesses are not doing well: they can increase their product range, for example. Back-street pubs cannot reduce costs because their budgets are so tight that they have no scope for that. Similarly, increasing revenue is not a viable option because small back-street pubs could not increase the amount of food they sell; many sell no food at all; they do not serve morning coffee or the other extras offered by modem pubs as a means of increasing revenue. The small backstreet pub is boxed into a comer and is at the mercy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has kicked those publicans firmly in the teeth. I deplore that; the Government should have taken a more relaxed view and helped the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern of our drinking habits has changed over the years. The amount of wine drunk now is appreciably greater than it was 10 or 15 years ago. The English wine industry is small and the consumption of English wine represents a tiny proportion of the total amount of wine drunk in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, last week 100 production jobs were lost in my constituency. The traditional method of production, using copper vats, was a beautiful sight; it has gone, and many of the drinks that will be

consumed in place of its beers and lagers will be coming from the continent. Wine will come from France, Spain, Germany, Yugoslavia, and so on. I am worried that in yet another way we are losing jobs. We cannot take it; we cannot go on having industries close down at the present rate.

The Minister referred to, the quantity of alcohol sold per pound or other unit of currency. I believe that a drinker with a long drink is not calculating how much alcohol he is downing per pint, except in extreme cases. Generally, drinkers go out for the evening, and their main interest is how much they are paying for the evening. That is why I am worried by the way that the Chancellor has increased the duties on many drinks above the level of inflation. I await with interest the Minister of State's answer on the total net revenue and what it means in relation to the current and predicted level of inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

First, I want to make the general point that the balance of whisky drinking and the price people pay for it has changed over the past two decades in relation to beer drinking and the price that people pay for beer. About 20 years ago it was as expensive to have a tot of whisky in a pub or club as a pint of beer. During the past 20 years beer has been more heavily taxed than whisky. Perhaps the cost of brewing beer has risen more sharply than the cost of distilling whisky. In my area, I can buy a pint of beer for about 68p and a tot of whisky for 47p or 49p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be fair enough to concede that there is an element of markup in the retail of distribution outlets in that equation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. The mark up for beer is about 50 or 60 per cent. and about 100 per cent. for whisky. If the mark-up were the same, beer would be even more expensive. That worries me. If Conservative Members have any expertise
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
on such matters, perhaps they will correct me if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) made an interesting speech, but at this stage I cannot agree with the main tenet of his argument. He made a special plea for whisky. I do not think that he has distilleries in his constituency; they are mainly in the Highlands, with perhaps a few in the west of the southern uplands, so I cannot accuse him of having a special interest. Was the hon. Gentleman making a special plea for a separate tax for whisky as opposed to other spirits such as gin, vodka and liqueurs such as Cointreau and Grand Marnier, which are imported? If he was, it would run counter to Common Market regulations and his argument would not stand. The basis of his argument was that whisky is already too highly priced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot go along with that argument. In alcohol content, a tot of whisky is probably equivalent to a half a pint of beer, so half a pint of beer is a little cheaper than a tot of whisky. But the public probably believe that a pint of beer is equal to a tot of whisky. They have either a tot of whisky or a pint of beer. In some places, people prefer beer, and in other places they tend to drink whisky. That does not apply universally because areas have a mix of people who have different jobs and tastes and different expectations of what they can get from life. Nevertheless, there are some people—many of them are unemployed at present—who like to drink beer but not whisky. Such people are being hard hit by the Government. The Conservative Government over the years and possibly, I admit, the previous Labour Government, have increased the price of beer more than the price of whisky. That is wrong. There should be some equity of treatment for all the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to join my hon. Friends in their pleas about the price of beer and about the brewing trade. We ought to have some equity. Differential pricing has gone too far. I look forward, when we debate next year's Budget, to being able to talk about a clause in which the beer duty has not increased as much as the other duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill, the Minister of State quotes the percentage increases in the various drinks as a result of the Budget. Cider comes top of the list, with 10.6 per cent. Sparkling wine and table wine is at 8.3 per cent. Beer is at 7.5 per cent., which is considerably above the rate of inflation. If the Government's predictions are right, the 7.5 per cent. for beer will remain considerably above the rate of inflation, which they forecast will increase in the summer but decrease again towards the end of the year. Vermouth and sherry are at 7.3 per cent. But the last two drinks are port at 6.3 per cent. and spirits at 1.9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that special pleas Work, because the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) tabled amendments which made many special pleas. He is to be congratulated, as they have had a good effect. The duty on whisky has increased by only 1.9 per cent. I also recall an eloquent speech from the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Stern) on behalf of port. Clearly his plea has had some effect, because the duty on port has increased only by 6.3 per cent., and it is the second lowest on the list. If there is to be justice and if the Government are to govern for all the people—for one country, not for two countries—they should take note of the pleas on behalf of the brewing industry. Therefore, I confidently expect that in next year's Finance Bill the increases proposed for beer will be substantially less than this year's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is serious. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) mentioned the closure of a brewery. In Wrexham, a brewery—the old Border brewery—has also closed. I do not fully understand what goes on in such places, but I believe that it had copper vats and that the beer was very good. The brewery was bought out by Marstons. I am not antagonistic towards Marstons. 'The company simply took over the brewery and closed it down so that the, people working there became unemployed. Now, Marstons are importing inferior beer into Wrexham. I hope that the company is not successful, because another brewery in Wrexham still makes its own beer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That example is symptomatic of what is happening now. I do not believe that it is what this country wants. I do not believe that people in this country want a Eurobeer which is exactly the same whether brewed in Burton, Wrexham, Kingston upon Hull or in Belgium, France or Germany. Something is added to, society when we can delight
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
in the beer produced by smaller breweries. The German nation realises the truth in that fact and has retained that facet of social life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the effect in the United Kingdom. It is important to keep our small breweries alive and healthy, but Opposition Members seriously doubt whether that position will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It it does not continue, there will be fewer and fewer breweries and something will be missing from the quality of life. I hope that the Minister will give us an idea of his philosophy behind the increases. There have been various increases in different years. Are there ad hoc reasons for that? Does the Minister say, " This year the industry looks as if it will be buoyant, so we can hit it a little harder than something else ", or does he say, " I have nothing else in mind until the next Budget in nine months' time when I shall think of something else "? If that is true, I do not mind if he admits it, because at least we and the industry will know where we stand.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer says that there is a philosophy in Budgets, and I should like to know what the Minister's is. I hope that he will be able to enlighten the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
