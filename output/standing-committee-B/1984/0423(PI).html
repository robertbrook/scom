<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. May I refer you to the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings on Tuesday at column 207, where the Committee was considering clause 23? My recollection is that the Minister of State rose on a point of order to say that he had decided that the Committee should be recommended not to include that clause in the Bill. At the foot of column 208, you will see that I said that because of the procedural manner in which we had dealt with clause 23 I had found it difficult to respond to what the Minister had said.<br><br>
<i>Hansard</i> does not report the matter in that way; it reports it as a straightforward stand part debate. Can you confirm, Mr. Leadbitter, that the points made by the Minister of State and by the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) were both points of order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was in the Chair on that occasion, and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is correct. The matter will be brought to the attention of the <i>Official Report</i>.</span></p>

Clause 28</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH DIRECTIONS ETC. OF TRIBUNAL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Blair<span class='memberconstituency'> (Sedgefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 28, leave out lines 26 to 29.<br><br>
The amendment has the effect of deleting subparagraph (2) from the new paragraph 10 which is to be added to schedule 8 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983.<br><br>
The Keith committee very sensibly recommended in volume 2 of its report, chapter 24.6.5, that where the special commissioners or the VAT tribunal made an assessment of tax, or penalty, or surcharge it should be recoverable in the High Court as a debt in the same way as any other award made by a court. The purpose was to ensure that there was no need to take separate action for recovery.<br><br>
Can the Minister say whether clause 28 follows Keith in the way that was intended? I assume that the purpose of the clause is to implement the Keith committee's recommendation, but I am worried that there may be a mix-up in the wording, and that is why I want to ask the Minister a question by way of a probing amendment.<br><br>
New paragraph 10(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person who fails to comply with a direction or summons issued by a value added tribunal … shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £1000."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
Subparagraph (2) provides that the penalty under subparagraph (1)
<br><blockquote><p>"may be awarded summarily by a tribunal notwithstanding that no proceedings for its recovery have been commenced."</p></blockquote>
Is it the Bill's intention to limit the power to award summarily and to institute proceedings for recovery to the penalty for failure to comply with the directions or summons of the VAT tribunal? Or is the intention to cover the original assessment of the VAT tribunal or special commissioners, and provide that the penalty need not go through the process of special recovery but may be awarded by the VAT tribunal?<br><br>
I hope that I have made the distinction between the two alternatives clear. I thought it worth putting the question to the Minister as, if we are to tighten up the enforcement powers fairly, the Keith recommendation seems sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr Peter Rees)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to do so, may I say that he has made his point with perfect clarity? He should be able to judge from my answer whether I have understood his question.<br><br>
Although we have, to a measure, adopted the Keith recommendation, we have diverged slightly. The proposal here relates not to the original assessment but to those cases where, for example, a person called before a VAT tribunal has ignored a witness summons or an order to produce documents. Prior to the Keith recommendations and prior to enactment of the Finance Bill—assuming that it finds favour with the House—a curious situation existed. The powers of the VAT tribunal with regard to such matters as witness summons and orders to produce documents had been enforced for the tribunal by Customs and Excise under what one might call criminal procedures. That was thought to be rather cumbersome and inappropriate.<br><br>
The Keith committee recommended that the matter should be dealt with by a contempt of court action, which would involve going before the High Court. We thought that also rather cumbersome, so it is proposed that the tribunal should have the right, subject to appeal—the provisions for which are set out in new paragraph 10(3)—to impose a monetary penalty of up to £1,000.<br><br>
The provision relates only to those narrow areas where, to be effective, the tribunal must have powers to ensure that proper evidence comes before it and that a witness crucial to the case obeys a summons. Originally, before the Bill, such matters were enforceable by the Customs and Excise, at the behest of the tribunal, by criminal procedures. Instead of that method, and instead of the Keith recommendation of going to the High Court for a contempt of court action, it was decided that it would be more appropriate to give the tribunal the power to make the conduct of its affairs, the cases heard before it, effective—subject, I emphasise, to the proper appeal procedure set out in new subparagraph (3).<br><br>
I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question and reassured the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has partly answered my point. I understand him to be saying that in circumstances where the VAT tribunal wishes to issue, for example, a witness summons, it is best that it can enforce the summons, directly, itself, and that it has a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0644">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
penalty for non-compliance. However, I understood that clause 28 was based on chapter 24.6.5 of the Keith report—I may be wrong. I understood that the Keith committee had gone further and recommended that it should be available to the VAT tribunal to award a sum summarily, so that there need be no separate proceedings for recovery, in relation not merely to breaches of witness orders, summonses or directions, but to the debt assessment or surcharge. Would there have to be separate proceedings for recovery by the VAT tribunal, so that its judgment would not stand as a judgment would in a court of law? If so, is there any reason why the Keith committee recommendations should not be followed so that the VAT tribunal assessment would stand as an ordinary judgment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make the position clear. The recovery of sums found due by the tribunal is dealt with in clause 29. The normal procedure will be for the debt to be registered and collected by the usual garnishee proceedings or bailiffs to enforce the tribunal's judgment.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), who has a keen eye for these matters, will see, clause 28 will apply where
<br><blockquote><p>"A person who fails to comply with a direction or summons issued by a value added tax tribunal under rules made under paragraph 9 above shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £1000."</p></blockquote>
We have diverged slightly from the Keith report in that regard, but basically we have taken on board his recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. I gather that clause 29 will deal exclusively with the enforcement of the VAT tribunal's decisions and clause 28 will be concerned simply with the penalties for failure to follow summons and directions. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
REFUND OF TAX IN CASES OF BAD DEBTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton<span class='memberconstituency'> (Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 30, line 9, after "insolvent", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or has failed to pay that amount within six months of the due date the person who supplied the goods or services has good reason to believe that the amount will not be paid.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 126, in page 32, line 27, after "insolvent", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or the amount has been outstanding for six months or more".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the state of my voice, although the Committee will realise that the conditions in which we work on Standing Committees are perfect for the incubation of germs, and I seem to have succumbed. However, I shall try to plod on.<br><br>
Clause 31 extends the present bad debts relief by making the appointment of an administrator under the Insolvency Act 1976 an event that triggers relief. It is noteworthy that the appointment of a receiver is not a triggering event for this purpose.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
The amendments would ensure that relief was allowed not just on the insolvency of the debtor but if the debt had been outstanding for more than six months and there were no prospect of its being paid. There are many reasons why this would improve the Bill. First, it would accord with the Treasury's desirable aim of bringing about symmetry in the tax system. What I propose for VAT is roughly what the Inland Revenue does for income tax.<br><br>
Section 130(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 sets out the conditions on which bad debts relief is available for the purposes of income tax. I have endeavoured to follow that format in spirit, if not in precise legal form, in the amendments. A single large bad debt is often the principal cause of failure of a small business. It is exacerbated by the additional loss of VAT until relief is obtained.<br><br>
There is a practical problem for businesses in those circumstances. A debtor may not become insolvent until long after the date on which the debt was originally incurred or judged to be bad. If VAT relief were given at an earlier date than that proposed in the Bill, it would provide a welcome improvement in the position of businesses unfortunate enough to have large bad debts dragging them down.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
Provided that the taxpayer has to account for any VAT subsequently recovered, he cannot profit from my proposed relief. I expect that my right honourable and learned Friend will say that if the amendment were accepted the Customs and Excise would make a double payment. The debtor would already have been able to claim his input tax relief. If we also made a repayment to the seller for output tax, the Customs and Excise would pay twice. By and large that is true, but it would not be true where the debtor was not a registered trader or if he was making exempt supplies. If my right honourable and learned Friend argued that Customs and Excise would make a double payment, he would be only partly accurate, but there would be more than a germ of truth in his contention.<br><br>
We must try to provide justice for anyone in that unfortunate plight. Under my proposal, the Customs and Excise would lose to some extent, but that does not justify extracting from the seller—the registered trader involved—money that he has not received. Such a trader is out of pocket, and the tax system should not perpetuate that injustice.<br><br>
If it remains a requirement that the debtor must be insolvent, there will continue to be a big incentive for predators to put businesses in trouble into liquidation earlier. Where there are no assets for distribution, additional work and expense is created for the official receiver or the courts. Besides justice to the taxpayer, we can adduce many good reasons for accepting the amendment. But I shall not speak at great length. I know that we hope to adjourn earlier than usual this evening. I commend my amendments to my right honourable and learned Friend and hope that he will accept them and draw the debate to a close rather sooner than would otherwise be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Maples <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very sympathetic to my hon. Friend's amendment, and I shall be interested to hear by right honourable and learned Friend's reply.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
First, I want to make sure that I understand the system. If a trader submits an invoice including VAT to a customer who does not pay, is it true that the trader will be liable for VAT and have no way of offsetting or reclaiming it? Like most hon. Members, I am not expert on VAT and, if my understanding is wrong, I hope that my right honourable and learned Friend will correct me.<br><br>
The provisions of the VAT legislation do not give even the right of a discretionary waiver to the VAT authorities to allow an adjustment later. Two instances from my constituency have been drawn to my attention. I imagine that the first is very common. A firm of estate agents constantly submits small invoices for items such as valuations, many of which are for surveys on properties subsequently not bought. Often the invoices are not paid. Individually, they are not big enough to make it worth sueing the customers, but the unpaid VAT that the estate agents have to pay the Government can amount to quite a lot.<br><br>
The other case is more serious. A small firm of architects for which times are not very easy at present did a great deal of work for a client who subsequently disputed a very large fee—£36,000. To sue for that fee the firm had to issue an invoice. It could not go to court without doing so. Otherwise it would have had nothing on which to sue unless it had a written contract with the client, which it did not. The firm had to issue an invoice for 06,000. As it had registered for VAT, it had to add the VAT which was about £5,000, and pay it to Customs and Excise with the next VAT return, although it knew that there was no way of recovering VAT from the customer unless and until it won a law suit, which, as we all know, will probably take a year or two.<br><br>
That firm is in danger of being driven into bankruptcy because it will have to find £5,000 or £6,000 to pay the VAT on this invoice which it knows that it cannot recover. That is wrong and unfair. I cannot believe that the Government intend to cause such problems for small businesses. In relation to VAT, registered traders are to some extent acting as the Government's tax collector—it is not like corporation tax which they pay on their own profits. They are collecting tax for the Government at the final end of a series of purchases and sales. They are paying VAT not on profits that they have made, but in respect of a series of transactions.<br><br>
It is unfair that the voluntary, unpaid tax collector should be penalised if he is not paid by someone who owes money to him. We know that the extension of credit is normal in almost every business, and something that should be taken into account in the legislation. I wonder whether my right honourable and learned Friend will say whether it would be possible for the person who pays the VAT not to be liable to do so unless and until he had received the VAT from his customer. Alternatively, a better and more simple system would be a procedure for a set-off, for a subsequent arrangement for recouping VAT paid to the Government and not recovered by the trader.<br><br>
I would be grateful if my right honourable and learned Friend could say whether my analysis is correct. Secondly, do the Government think that that is fair? Thirdly, do the Government have any ideas for how that system could be made fairer? If so, do they intend to bring them forward at any stage?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours<span class='memberconstituency'> (Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a lot to sympathy with the amendment, although I am not convinced that this is the way in which to proceed. The two hon. Members have drawn attention to a major problem for small businesses. I recall innumerable occasions in my experience when we were basically lending the Exchequer money because people had insisted on taking so much credit. If such extension of credit exceeded the quarterly accounting to Customs and Excise, in effect we were lending it money. That is deplorable for small companies.<br><br>
That affects some small companies more than others, especially where clients of a company are small traders themselves. One could be in difficulty if one was in a business distributing to shopkeepers, and especially if one had a national network of shopkeepers distributors with thousands of accountants, and in a year was selling no more than £500 or £1,000 worth of materials or products to each of those accounts. I referred to being in arrears the other night. Traders slip into arrears because they cannot afford to be funding this money which is on loan to the Exchequer.<br><br>
I think that the Chief Secretary will say that that proposal could lead to abuse, as people will seek to defer payment for six months and avoid paying VAT. That problem will arise. However, that is why I have reservations about the amendment. I do not oppose the thrust of it. The Government have a responsibility to find a solution to the problem. It is unfair, and it is an unreasonable imposition on many registered traders.<br><br>
Perhaps we should devise a system whereby the liability to pay is transferred to the customer. At first glance, such a system might seem rather complex, but I am not sure that it is. I wonder whether it would be possible for the Customs and Excise to invoice the trader who purchased the goods to the value of the outstanding money paid by the vendor who is responsible for collection.<br><br>
That system may seem complex, but it may not be so. Furthermore, it would help the Customs and Excise to target on the very people who are the sinners. To some extent, the objective in Keith was to try to identify ways of targeting to ensure maximum compliance with the legislation. If that can be done by referring the responsibility for payment to the person in default, we shall help that process. Perhaps the Chief Secretary will write off the principle of the amendment and address himself to what is a very real problem for many small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to concur with my hon. Friend [<i>Interruption.</i>] the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) appears to be troubled. Perhaps he will say why. If he is concerend about the expedition of our proceedings, he would do better to stay quiet.<br><br>
We are dealing here with small traders—for example, builders and others—who issue invoices, often for large jobs, so that a large lump of VAT immediately becomes payable, and they cannot claim the money back until they are paid. The debts can be outstanding for a long time.<br><br>
I have reservations about the amendment. However, I would prefer to leave what I have to say until we reach clause 32, which deals with the reasonable excuses that people can have for not paying VAT. Briefly, my concern is that it is up to the trader issuing the invoice.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0646">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
As long as he can say that the money has been outstanding for more than six months and that he has good reason to believe that it will be outstanding, he is not liable. To my mind, that is a very broad extension and one that could be open to abuse. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), I have doubts about the amendment, but the broad spirit of it is worth the examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> I sympathise with the amendments in cases of hardship, and I am sure that there are countless such cases. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples) told us of a particularly nasty case where, because of other laws that exist, it seems nothing can be done.<br><br>
I believe that the Government and the Treasury ought to get their money, and, if the amendment were accepted, it would create uncertainty about whether VAT would be collected. I therefore cannot support the amendment. However, the VAT authorities should be able to exercise flexibility when there is a genuine case for delaying payment until such time as the trader's difficulties in paying the Customs and Excise are overcome. I wonder whether the best way to proceed would be to leave the Bill as it is, and see whether the VAT authorities can exercise more flexibility in the cases that have been brought to our attention.</span></p>
<p>5 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I do not understand the problem fully. I can see that this is a major problem for many very small businesses that have invoices outstanding. But the difficulty is that, if we provide a mechanism for compensating businesses or traders, abuse is bound to ensue. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) made a good point when he said that liability must be transferred to the trader who has failed to make the payment for whatever reason.<br><br>
Perhaps I am going rather wide of the amendment before us, but a problem clearly exists. The conflict of interests in this case is with the Customs and Excise, one of whose prime tasks is to ensure that the Exchequer gets the taxes to which it is entitled. As we have said on earlier clauses, unless we have tighter controls to provide an incentive for traders to pay up within a given period—in this case six months—the problem will continue. But I do not know whether the amendment tabled by the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) would provide the right solution to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting debate on the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), who spoke with his customary charm even though he is suffering acutely from laryngitis. We wish him well and hope that he will survive these rigorous encounters.<br><br>
The principle at stake in the amendment has interested right hon. and honourable Members, including myself, for many years. Indeed, I recall tabling a variety of amendments touching on this subject while in opposition. The previous Labour Administration made the first substantial amendment in this area in 1978. We are going a little further towards liberalising the rules under which a registered trader can claim relief for a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
bad debt and the circumstances in which he can claim it.<br><br>
Let me say straight away that I do not find entirely convincing the argument that we should try to achieve symmetry with income tax provisions. I am aware that under those provisions a taxpayer engaged in professional or commercial operations is entitled to deduct a debt that is proved to be bad—if neccesary to the satisfaction of a body of commissioners but normally by agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
The fundamental difference between income tax and value added tax is that income tax is usually paid on an annual basis and that it is therefore much easier to adjust the position between the taxpayer and the Revenue than it is to adjust the position on VAT. Let us suppose that a taxpayer claims to deduct a debt on the ground that it is bad and produces evidence that satisfies the Revenue or a body of commissioners that it is bad, but that subsequently the debt is paid or becomes recoverable. In such cases it is relatively easy for the Revenue and the taxpayer to adjust matters in a subsequent year, and in a subsequent set of accounts. But if my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton reflects on the difficulty in the case of VAT levied on transactions on supply and not by reference to an annual set of accounts, he will realise that we should have to equip the Customs and Excise with a formidable battery of powers and a great many extra officers to enable it to recover VAT paid to a taxpayer who had established a prima facie case that the debt was bad. I am rather oppressed by those practical considerations. I hope that, on reflection, my hon. Friend will feel that the symmetry argument is not quite as persuasive as might first appear.<br><br>
The more general point made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee is important. There has to be a fair balance between the interests of Customs and Excise and those of the taxpayer. We cannot expect a taxpayer to be pushed to the wall in the interests of Customs and Excise or the Exchequer as a whole. On the other hand, I am sure that the Committe will agree that a supplier should not be allowed to transmit the whole commercial risk of a transaction to the Customs and Excise.<br><br>
It is not often that I find myself entire persuaded by the arguments of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), whose remarks were neat and succinct on this occasion. Customs and Excise has got to get its money. I do not want to embarrass the hon. Gentleman by identifying an occasion when he and I spoke on the same point.—[<i>Interruption.</i>] No doubt it will be put right by the powerful arguments of his hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who will present a contrary case. I will also listen to his arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not deploying the argument misunderstanding the problem? We are talking only of 15 per cent of the risk or more—the remaining 85 per cent or less is carried by the vendor. Surely it is that interest that we are trying to safeguard if it is the majority interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Mathematically, the hon. Gentleman's proposition must stand up. I know his acute commercial and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
mathematical mind. However, it is for the supplier to gauge the course of business. Customs is detached from that. It may collect tax eventually from the flow of transactions. But the customs collector cannot Step in and say, "Aren't you taking rather a risk there?" In other words Customs is carrying on willy-nilly—admittedly only to the extent of about 15 per cent—but it is exposed to risk on the judgment of the supplier. That is the difficulty<br><br>
I am attracted at first blush to the argument, "Why cannot the tax be collected in all or a range of cases from the person to whom the goods or services are supplied?" No doubt the Committee will reflect upon the practicalities of that. At present, there are about 70,000 registered traders and it is difficult enough to keep track of them and their transactions. I could not begin to guess how many transactions are subject to VAT in a year or how many individuals do business with registered traders, but it must be millions. That is self evident. To saddle Customs and Excise with the responsibility for tracking down the person who should have paid for the goods and services and paid the VAT would be a monumental task way beyond it. It would transform the process of VAT collection, and transform the character of, and add immeasurably to, the numbers of Customs and Excise officers. While I understand the logic of the argument, I am oppressed by its practicalities.<br><br>
In all these cases, we must try to strike a fair balance between the interests of the supplier and the interests of Customs and Excise. We have moved the frontiers a good deal further than they were in 1978. We have defined the circumstances in which insolvency should be presumed, and defined the obligations on a supplier who wishes to claim relief. I hope that on the whole the Committee will feel that we have been reasonably generous to the supplier in this class of case.<br><br>
I have outlined the difficulty of going much further. Obviously I am aware of the impact on a supplier's cash flow. I was moved by the examples given by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples). However, I hope that I will be forgiven for reminding the Committee that value added tax has not been pure loss to the cash flow of suppliers. On average, the supplier has the VAT in his pocket for two and a half months. It is a paradox that VAT has, to a degree, improved the cash flow position of suppliers. If we are worried about the impact of VAT on the cash flow position of suppliers, we must bear in mind the crucial point that, on average, suppliers have a slight compensation because they hold the VAT' collected on behalf of Customs and Excise for two and a half months. That has been recognised ever since the tax was introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary says that on average, VAT is held for two and a half months. That depends upon the sector in which the business operates. Is it fair, therefore, to produce that figure? Small businesses are not in such a commanding position that they can allocate credit. Those businesses may be at a substantial loss because their purchasers seek longer credit than they can obtain from manufacturers or distributors who are in a stronger position. It is grossly unfair to quote such a figure when in certain sectors of industry, credit arrangements are substantially different and where credit might be extended for substantially longer. In such a sector, four and five months credit
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
may be average. Why should the whole of that sector be penalised because the supplier has difficulty in collecting cash?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is entitled to make that point, and we should be aware of possible cases of hardship. I do not regard VAT as being directed especially at small traders.<br><br>
I must apologise to the Committee for giving a totally wrong figure for the number of registered traders. I am reminded that there are 1,400,000. I am afraid that I gave the figure for purchase tax traders.<br><br>
To a degree only, I recognise that the very small trader is cushioned because he is not liable for VAT. I am not saying that the tax does justice very far up the scale. However, as the hon. Gentleman will understand, general rules of application which would have to be framed in order to build in a great number of minuscule, tightly-defined reliefs will make the tax much more difficult to administer and very much more difficult for individual traders. In our anxiety to do justice to the hard cases, I diffidently suggest that we must not overcomplicate a tax which we are sometimes charged with having made too complex already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable and learned Friend referred to this matter as a cash flow problem, the compensation for which was that the supplier often held other people's VAT. I may have completely misunderstood the position, but I believe that the case to which I referred involves not a cash flow problem but an absolute loss. Once the supplier has issued the invoice, he becomes liable with his next VAT return to pay that £5,000 or £6,000 to Customs and Excise. If he does not recover it from the person to whom he supplied the goods, there is no mechanism by which it can be set off against a subsequent VAT payment. Would it be possible to introduce a simple set off mechanism?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that it could be done. My hon. Friend cited the case of a constituent who is an architect, and I understand that the architect may be involved in litigation with his client. How could such a case be defined? Is the mere issue of a writ, or the possibility of litigation, to exempt the registered trader from the duty of accounting for VAT? In such a case, the check or stopper on the flow of revenue would be enormous. There must be a range of transactions which could readily be said, in the initial stages, to be likely to lead to litigation. We must try to strike a balance between the interests of the individual traders and those of Customs and Excise collecting on behalf of the general body of taxpayers.<br><br>
If my hon. Friend is able to table a watertight and readily operable amendment on Report which may do justice to the sort of cases that he has in mind, I assure the Committee that I shall consider it with an open mind. However, hon. Members will recognise that ultimately we must have a fairly easily administered tax and fairly simple and easily understood ground rules. After all, we are easing the rules in favour of the supplier and going beyond the position that existed in 1979 and have, I hope, made matters easier for the taxpayer. While I understand the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), I must tell him and the Committee that the administrative cost will be between £100 million and £125 million and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
involve Customs and Excise in engaging between 100 and 200 more staff.<br><br>
Therefore, while I recognise the points that have been made, I hope that the Committee will feel that we have tried to strike a fair balance. We have moved the frontier forward in favour of the registered supplier, so I hope that my hon. Friend will not feel disposed to press his amendment.</span></p>
<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I applaud and approve the steps which the Government have taken to extend the relief for bad debts, and they will be welcomed by the whole of the commercial community. However, I am unhappy that my right honourable and learned Friend seemed to endorse the approach of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), who said that Customs and Excise must get its money. The whole point of the argument was that we are talking about money not received, or, indeed, receivable in the event, by a supplier, and in those circumstances I find it difficult to understand the argument that Customs and Excise is entitled, except as a matter of strict law, to the money. Certainly, I would not regard it as the property of Customs and Excise in any other sense than that.<br><br>
Therefore, while I appreciate the practicalities that exist and accept the technical deficiency of the form of words in which I have tried to clothe the point, I believe that we could examine the matter a little more closely to decide whether we might be able to provide, as my right honourable and learned Friend said, a more watertight version of my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman wish to challenge the figure of £120 million? We may wish to return to the amendment at other stages or, indeed, in further years, of this or other Finance Bills, so it is important that we should now try to establish how that calculation was made. I cannot see how it is possible to place any figure on the amendment, and it seems that some guesswork has gone on in Customs and Excise. On most occasions when there is an attempt to cost an amendment it is not too difficult to see how it is done, but on this occasion it is impossible to see how it was costed without some form of conjecture. If that were the case, would not it be wiser for it to be deleted from the contribution of the Chief Secretary to ensure that future debates on this matter will be cleaner and more pertinent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his legendary nimble intellect, the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has anticipated a point which I had intended to pursue. I agree that it is difficult to see how it is possible to arrive, other than by means of mere guesswork, at such an exact figure, and I hope that my right honourable and learned Friend may be able to give us guidance on how it was arrived at.<br><br>
Certainly, arguments about the practicalities and difficulties of the administration of Customs and Excise, or even the cost to the Exchequer, will be small compensation to a trader who is forced out of business as a result of debts which he cannot ultimately recover from the person to whom he has supplied goods or from Customs and Excise to which he has handed over
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
tax in relation to a supply for which he has not been paid nor, in the event, will be paid. Of course, as my my right honourable and learned Friend said, we must weight the advantages to the Exchequer against those to the taxpayer, but there is a case in simple justice in this instance that goes far beyond tax consequences and into employment and so on. While I appreciate the spirit of good will with which my my right honourable and learned Friend has, as ever, been a beguilingly eloquent stone wall, I believe that we should return to this issue. Although I shall not press the amendment for technical reasons, I hope that it will be possible to adopt its principle and put right what I regard as a considerable injustice. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Hirst <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 31, line 13, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"of any dividend in respect"</p></blockquote>
and insert "in full".<br><br>
I welcome clause 31 as a worthwhile improvement in helping ordinary trade creditors in an insolvency. But as I said during the Second Reading of the Insolvency Bill, I am concerned about the prescriptive requirement contained in it. When an insolvency is announced, ordinary trade creditors often press the administrator or receiver very hard to issue a certificate saying that in his opinion there are insufficient assets to allow for the payment of a dividend to unsecured creditors. It is extremely difficult for an insolvency practitioner in the early stages of a receivership or an administration procedure to say with any certainty the likely amount that will be realised and whether there will be any surplus available to pass on to the liquidator for the payment of an ordinary dividend.<br><br>
I am concerned about those cases in which there are advantageous realisations, thereby leaving some funds available for distribution. Buildings, stocks and goodwill have uncertain realisable values. If the receiver is fortunate enough to find a buyer who is keen to have them, he may realise considerably more than had been expected. But if an ordinary creditor cannot have such a certificate from the receiver, there is a danger that in concert with other major unsecured creditors—he will petition for the appointment of a liquidator, after which he can recover the VAT on the bad debt. That would be undesirable. Indeed, the Insolvency Bill acknowledges that there should not be competing claims from both a receiver and a liquidator. In any event, such a procedure tends to militate against the interests of smaller firms that are unsecured creditors.<br><br>
The purpose of my amendment is to enable ordinary trade creditors to recover VAT when it appears that the receiver or administrator cannot say whether the debt will be repaid in full. If subsequent realisations enable a dividend to be paid, there will have to be an accounting for the appropriate proportion of VAT.<br><br>
I expect that my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary will say that my proposal would be administratively complex; I would not disagree with that. But let us suppose that a receiver or administrator issues in good faith a certificate saying that in his opinion no funds will be available for the payment of an ordinary dividend, but subsequently realises much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0649">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
more than had been expected and a surplus becomes available. In those circumstances there will have to be an adjustment for VAT when the dividend is paid. I am trying to give to ordinary trade creditors the cash flow advantage that would be available to them if there were a liquidation rather than a receiver or administrator being appointed. I hope that my my right honourable and learned Friend will make some encouraging comments about my proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as one would suspect from his keen professional experience and knowledge, has made a powerful case.<br><br>
Clause 31(3) is perhaps drawn too tightly in the sense that the administrator, or the administrative receiver, must certify that no dividend is likely to be paid. That may have been put a little too tightly but, equally, I suspect that my hon. Friend relaxes a little too much. He says that the administrator, or the administrative receiver, must say that a full dividend cannot be paid. Something in between the two is., perhaps, the more usual run of the mill. Therefore, I should like to look again at that issue.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has immediately identified, too, some of the practical considerations that have weighed with me. If we make it too easy, and relief for bad debts is given in too wide a number of cases where, in a future course of events it turns out that the debt is not totally bad, again Customs will have to look to that registered supplier to recover the relief that he has been given. That will raise certain practical problems. I do not think that I need labour them because my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) has divined them and we touched on them in our debate on his amendment.<br><br>
We are moving into slightly different waters, not only because we have introduced a considerable measure of relaxation for cases of bad debts in the clause, but also because—depending on how the House views it the new Insolvency Bill will, one hopes, become law before too long.<br><br>
We would like to see how the administration of the provisions, as we have put them to the House and the Committee, proceed, particularly when the Insolvency Bill is enacted. If we find that we have not given an adequate measure of justice to the registered supplier, we will be ready to come back and look at the measure again.<br><br>
On the basis that I am not trying to shut out further debate—indeed, how could I?—I suggest to the Committee that we should see how the provisions work out against the altered circumstances of the Insolvency Bill. I cannot give a particular undertaking because I cannot foresee what will happen. However, I can say that the Government will be ready to come back with an open mind to the problem when we have a better understanding of what is happening.<br><br>
On that basis, since my hon. Friend has registered his point powerfully—I am sure that it will not be forgotten—I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right honourable and learned Friend for his reply. In view of the assurance he has given that he is prepared to re-examine the position in the light of the way in which the Insolvency Bill works after enactment, I shall withdraw the amendment. However, I should like to place on record that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
I am doubtful whether the administration would be appropriate, in any event, if there were no expectation of ordinary trade creditors receiving any payment. In view of the comments made by my right honourable and learned Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 31, line 21, leave out "to the person to whom they were supplied" and insert "from the supplier".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 66, in page 31, line 21, leave out "to the person to whom they were supplied" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"from the person by whom they were supplied".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 61 and 66 are essentially the same except that my amendment No. 61 is briefer than amendment No. 66, tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), which is what we would expect.<br><br>
Section 22(4) of the principal Act states the circumstances in which someone is entitled to a refund and that the entitlement cannot occur unless, in the case of the supply of goods, the property and the goods pass to the person to whom they were supplied. In other words, the trigger that allows an entitlement to a refund is that property and goods pass to the customer.<br><br>
The problem is that the passing of property is a notoriously difficult legal concept. The Law Society and others felt that it would be much clearer if the trigger was the passing of property from the supplier, so that the determinant was the supplier yielding up the property of the goods, rather than the property passing to the customer. That is because a supplier could relinquish his property of the goods without the customer receiving them.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to explain why the amendment cannot be accepted. Although it is small, it would give additional protection to traders.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister could deal with another matter which I think arises whether the clause remains as it is or the amendments are accepted. It relates to what is known as the Romalpa clause and the retention of title in a sale of goods between parties. Under the clause, a trader sells goods and is allowed to retain his title to them until the full purchase price is paid. What is the position of VAT in those circumstances? Is the trader liable for VAT even though the purchase price has not been paid, or do the retention of title clauses allow him to escape the consequences which we debated earlier and render him not liable to pay VAT until the purchase price has been paid? That is a genuine question, as I do not know what difference the retention of title clauses, which are now very common, might make.</span></p>
<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trouble with the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) is that he has not yet recovered from losing his deposit in the Beaconsfield by-election three years ago next Thursday. Having said that, may I say that I consider his amendment superior to my own, and I support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply, although I do not want to intervene in this rather specialised debate between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0650">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), which can be resolved in other ways, no doubt. I shall respond first to the speech of the hon. Member for Sedgefield. I understand and appreciate the tentative way in which he moved his amendment; he obviously wants to explore some of the more arcane recesses of property law.<br><br>
As I understand it—I shall not cover every conceivable legal permutation—VAT is charged on the supply of goods or services, which does not necessarily involve the transfer of property, and I understand that the hon. Gentleman wishes relief to be available when property has left the supplier but has not necessarily reached the person to whom it is sent and who cannot meet the payment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield has referred to transactions covered by a decision in 1976, which I believe is known in the legal profession as the Romalpa decision. If a relief could be specifically tailored for such transactions, I would be influenced by the hon. Gentleman's arguments. But his amendment, as it is drawn, would cover practically every case in which property has moved from the supplier but has not necessarily come to rest in the hands of the person who proves to be insolvent or nearly insolvent.<br><br>
We think that hire purchase transactions might be covered by the hon. Gentleman's case, and these perhaps should not be regarded by the Committee as quite so meritorious. In hire purchase transactions, the supplier usually has recourse to the assets and is therefore protected. We have puzzled over the matter and asked the draftsmen whether they could narrow relief to cover genuine cases which the hon. Gentleman and I have in mind, but that has eluded our efforts so far.<br><br>
We shall try to produce something before Report, but I cannot give an undertaking. However, if the hon. Gentleman can produce something that will not open the doors too widely, we shall consider it with open mind on Report. He will recognise that the amendment, as presently drawn, goes rather wider than the narrow class of case that he has in mind. It would let in hire-purchase cases and, as I said, we believe that the supplier is adequately protected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary has asked my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) to table amendments on Report to deal with the problem. The Minister has thousands of civil servants at his disposal and I am sure that many sympathise with the spirit of the amendments which have been moved. Does he not have a duty to instruct his own civil servants to find a way round these problems and to present the amendments on Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can have heard what I said. I said that we would continue to try to devise a solution. I should like to correct him on one point. I certainly do not have thousands of civil servants whom I can ask to cover such an arcane point. Customs and Excise, brilliant though it is, and well staffed though it is, does not have even 100 people who could devote their talents to such matters.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a solution already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted, but I do not think that he has because I have had long and anxious discussions with the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) as soon as I saw that he had tabled an amendment. We shall certainly try to devise something to narrow the relief. I merely said to the hon. Member for Sedgefield that if he were able to devise something, we should consider it with an open mind. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis of what the Minister said. I shall certainly try to formulate a piece of drafting that can meet the point. I hope that the Minister and his officials will do likewise. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF CHAPTER II</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we discussed an earlier amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), I said that while I understood the spirit of the amendment, I thought that it could be better dealt with in another way.<br><br>
I understand the difficulties of exempting a trader from liability to VAT, even though a customer is still solvent, when a trader has good reason to believe that he will not get his money. The Minister argued that the commercial risk should fall, if anywhere, on the trader and that there would be a tremendous administrative difficulty in chasing up invoices and VAT payments if the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton had been accepted. A problem arising from that suggestion seemed to be that VAT payment might be received some time later after a refund had already been agreed. I agree that there are difficulties in that respect. However, we are all agreed that a legitimate problem arose when invoices were issued, on which the VAT became payable, when the trader might not be paid for a long time.<br><br>
The Bar is unique in its arrangement. I am pleased that my trade union is looking after me in that respect. The liability to VAT for barristers does not arise until fees are received. I hope that my understanding is right. Otherwise, I have been operating on a difficult basis over the last few years.<br><br>
If we accept that there are circumstances in which it would be extremely unfair for traders to be liable for VAT on unpaid invoices—I realise that it might be wrong for such traders to be entitled to a refund—it seems that their failure to recover money should at least be taken into account in the severity of penalty or surcharge that might be made for failure to pay VAT. A trader might be in tremendous financial embarrassment because he could not pay his VAT although his reason might be the failure of a customer to pay VAT on outstanding debts. Therefore, when the trader who is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0651">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
in default goes to the commissioners or the VAT tribunal, a penalty, surcharge or interest could be levied upon him although his genuine financial difficulty had been caused by a customer's failure to pay him.<br><br>
I understand why he should not be excused from paying VAT or should not receive a refund when he has a cash-flow problem caused by a customer's failure to pay, but I believe that sympathy should be shown by taking that into account when a trader wishes to use that fact as a reasonable excuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might have misheard my hon. Friend, but there were expressions of surprise when he said that the liability of barristers to pay VAT arose only when they were paid their fees. Will my hon. Friend explain the mechanism whereby that is possible? There might be a way forward by using such an arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for asking for an explanation. As I understand it, there is no liability to VAT for members of the Bar until payment is made. I am unaware of the historical reasons for it. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) will be worried that it is another nail in the coffin of the legal profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not exactly that. It is another privilege for the legal profession. Surely, the explanation is that the legal profession accounts on a cash basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to agree that it is a privilege. I understand Conservative Members to argue that the privilege that is extended to the Bar should be extended to cover all traders. I put the argument to show that it is not impossible to envisage circumstances in which such relief from VAT could be arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend for asking for explanations that should be given by the Government. I smelt a rat when my hon. Friend mentioned the power of the Bar. Is the privilege extended also to solicitors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair is having difficulty in relating the trend of the debate to the Question whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. There is a reasonable case for flexibility, but let us not stretch it too far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not stretch if too far, but may I answer my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby, Mr. Mitchell? I have to tell my hon. Friend that I do not know.<br><br>
I am arguing that when examining what is a reasonable excuse for being in default, it is right to take into account the fact that a trader might have cash-flow problems arising directly from the non-payment of VAT, which should be taken into account somewhere.<br><br>
I tried to draft an amendment to the clause but despite considerable thought it was difficult to be precise. Therefore, it seemed right to raise the issue on the clause stand part debate. Can the Minister assure me that the fact that some traders and firms have genuine problems because of outstanding VAT liability and resultant cash-flow problems will at least be taken into account when penalties, surcharges and interest are being levied upon them? When examining the harshness
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
of the penalty that may be visited upon them that is an important consideration. I do not know whether it is possible to frame a change in the rules to take account of that, but it is worth the Minister's investigation.<br><br>

Problems on VAT have been greatly increased for traders and for everybody by the rise in the tax from 8 per cent to 15 per cent. Those of us who remember election promises may recall that a promise was given not to increase VAT, but it was doubled very soon after the 1979 election. So when we talk about cash flow problems we should bear in mind the exacerbation caused by raising the VAT base.<br><br>
The Minister should attempt to meet the legitimate problems of VAT traders who cannot take into account cash flow problems resulting directly from a failure to pay VAT when deciding on the type of penalty to be visited upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate covering a wide range of subjects. I shall not add my perception of the problems or advantages of the Bar to those of the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), except to say that unlike most, though not all, professions or vocations it is unable to sue for its fees except in a very limited range of cases. I suspect that that is the historic basis. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who has a deep knowledge of commercial life, may reflect on the impact that would have in other areas.<br><br>
I do not think that the matter is strictly within the rules of order, Mr. Leadbitter. It was only because it was raised in the debate that I have commented upon it.<br><br>
Once again, I am happy to make common cause with the hon. Member for Sedgefield, who may suffer from the same disabilities as I do, and who may suffer again in that regard.<br><br>
The Keith committee did not generally recommend that there should be a defence of reasonable excuse, but because we are softening the administration of VAT a little in some regards in the interest of the taxpayer by making the collection of VAT a little more crisper while recognising that there are areas where we must take account of the taxpayers' position, that defence is now available in relation to clauses 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sedgefield has fastened on the same point that was made by my hon. Friends the Members for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples) in earlier debates this afternoon. That is the important but narrow area that would be covered by this defence. If would cover a situation where a registered trader had been paid the VAT, had enjoyed it for a month or two and had used it as working capital, dissipated it—either by misfortune or for more or less creditable reasons—and then found that he was unable to pay. I am sure that that is not the type of case that the hon. Gentleman would wish to cover. Capable advocate that he is, the hon. Member for Sedgefield has fastened on a much narrower and more sympathetic class of cases. However, the deletion of the subsection would cover all such cases.<br><br>
Against the background of our earlier debates this afternoon I shall look sympathetically at the matter,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
although I shall not give an undertaking to come up with anything on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blair</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister understand that there is a distinction between the amendment moved earlier that would obliterate the liability to VAT altogether so that there would be an entitlement to a refund or no liability and circumstances in which the obligation to pay is simply delayed, corresponding to the refusal to pay?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand. As in that debate, this is a question of striking a fair balance between the Customs and Excise and the registered trader. We must reflect on the needs of the Customs and Excise, and also consider how meritorious would be the cases put forward if we were to make any amendment. We must also reflect on the fact that in many cases the trader has the benefit of VAT for two and a half months. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to make comments on rates of VAT—we have been debating those since 1979 and do not want to re-open that debate now—and will know that the rate has not been doubled. We must be precise. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, with his fine legal training, would not wish to tell a court that the rate has been doubled. Increases in rates, in a sense, add to the trader's cash flow, leaving a larger sum in his hands for a period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Chief Secretary answer a simple question? He said that he understood that barristers have this rather privileged position because they cannot sue. That is only half an answer; the Minister must give us the other half and tell us on what legal basis barristers are not required to comply with VAT legislation as set out here. How can they get round paying, irrespective of whether they have the right to sue or not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very tempted to reply to the hon. Gentleman, and will be happy to do so on some other occasion, but I think that I would be outside the rules of order if I were to do so now. I am speaking without having reflected on the subject, as the question does not, strictly, arise in this case. The hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend, in his good nature, responded to an intervention, and you, Mr. Leadbitter, allowed the point to be developed. However, I do not think, strictly speaking, that it arises. If need be, I could look up the answer and write to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the intervention of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. CampbellSavours)—unless the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is trying to assist me—in writing, setting out the answer succinctly. The matter was much canvassed back in 1972, and, I expect, on other occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I indicated that some degree of flexibility is reasonable, but that the Committee must not stretch the matter too far. The subject matter being discussed now is not really contained within the limits of clause 32. Having said that, I agree that the Chair will be reasonable, provided that speeches are reasonably brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Leadbitter. This is a point of importance to the Opposition, because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
the nature of the Minister's answer will decide whether we divide on clause stand part. If current rumours are correct, it may well be a question of some importance to the Minister, who may be resuming his practice at the Bar.<br><br>
Does the privilege apply to any other profession? What is the mechanism by which barristers are exempted from the provision that applies to everyone else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Leadbitter, that you would correct me if I were to attempt to go wide. The question does not arise on clause 32. We could have an interesting debate on what is not necessarily a privilege. I am not certain that the treatment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must allow me at least to respond. The treatment involves the moment at which VAT becomes chargeable. In my view—and I think that the Chair has so ruled—the question does not arise on clause 32, so I would be wrong to respond to the hon. Gentleman. I shall write to him. I cannot be fairer than that. The arrangement goes back many years, since the introduction of VAT, and it has continued unchanged under Labour Administrations. I shall delve into the historic basis and I shall write to the hon. Member for Workington, sending a copy to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby, to say whether any comparable provisions apply to other professions, vocations or trades.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended not to pursue the privileged position of the Bar, but to consider the term "reasonable excuse". The essence of the clause is that having insufficient money is not regarded as a reasonable excuse not to pay one's dues. I shall not broaden the point to the general state of the economy and its effect on small businesses. We all know about that. However, the problems of small businesses are particularly bad because of the depressed state of the economy.<br><br>
At the weekend I visited a shoe factory in my constituency. It was interesting to see that although the factory was efficient and well equipped, it was having great difficulty getting money out of large suppliers. There is a trend towards fewer and larger suppliers, so small businesses cannot obtain the margin that they would like, and the large suppliers—we all know who they are—are able to determine when payment is made.<br><br>
That is why we need to scrutinise the term "reasonable excuse". I realise that if we made the unavailability of money a reasonable excuse for not paying all the penalties, surcharges and taxes, it would be open to abuse and difficulties would ensue. However, Customs and Excise should not embark on complex and time-consuming procedures, thus incurring high costs. Although it can be said that having insufficient funds is not a reasonable excuse, the trend towards bigger and fewer suppliers creates particular problems for small businesses. The Labour party is the party of small businesses, and we are anxious to do all that we can to protect them.<br><br>
I can understand the difficulties and the reasons why the Keith report suggested that insufficiency of funds was not a reasonable excuse for not paying debts. But in the day-to-day commercial world it is a matter of great concern. This may not be the time to scrutinise the matter closely, but it must increasingly be taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0653">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
into account. The view of the Committee next year might be quite different as the trend to which I referred continues and as the difficulties for traders result in insolvencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I go along completely with my hon. Friend's argument. I realise that there are difficulties but what does my hon. Friend say about the fact that VAT should not be used as working capital but handed to the tax authorities? I agree that there are difficulties but surely the principle must be that which I enunciated.</span></p>
<p>6 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. What he says is true, but the Chief Secretary pointed out the dilemma of ensuring a balance between the trader and the Exchequer. The Exchequer wants to maximise its funds and bring them in as quickly as possible. Yet our legislative structure does not create the right incentive for traders to pay their taxes when they should or for customers to pay their invoices. Although everyone should pay his tax and expeditiously, because of other legislation too complicated to discuss in detail traders encounter immense difficulties because their customers fail to pay on time. It is a difficult balancing act that will be accentuated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to raise a point of order but to ask you, Mr. Leadbitter, about your rulings on the clause. I am not in a position to challenge the Chair and I would never wish to do so.<br><br>
I put it to you, Mr. Leadbitter, that the issue raised in relation to barristers was directly in order. I shall establish why so that we can proceed down that route.<br><br>
Although the Minister has undertaken in a friendly and helpful way to provide me with all the information that I seek on the privilege for barristers, I do not agree that that is what I need at this stage. I shall accept that correspondence but we are on the clause stand part debate. My understanding of the clause stand part debate is such that I require some information but it is not available during today's sitting.<br><br>
The insufficiency of funds identified in clause 32(2) relates directly to a lawyer's right not to sue. In gaining the original concession from the Government, the lawyers' fraternity must have argued that there was a problem of insufficiency of funds. The question of whether it is reasonable that a barrister but not a trader has that right should be the subject of debate today.<br><br>
The Chief Secretary should be able to tell us why a barrister has that concession which a trader in my constituency does not. Why should a barrister be treated in this particular way? What does he have that a trader in my constituency does not? What transaction does a barrister enter into that a trader in my constituency does not? A barrister offers a service and invoices for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair is seeking to be helpful in the light of the undertakings that have been given. The Chair is anxious that the hon. Gentleman should be as free as possible to make his point. However, I must ask him whether he is making a speech or raising a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear, Mr. Lead-bitter, that I was not raising a point of order, and that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
I was entering the debate, although I would address myself to your rulings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty, and we have time to get round it. If the hon. Gentleman is making a speech, he is out of order with the ruling of the Chair. When I gave it, I offered some flexibility, although I said that it should not be stretched too far. Later I suggested that it would be helpful if hon. Members were more concise. However, the hon. Gentleman should consider and use his ingenuity—which he has ample experience to explore—and see how best to introduce a point of order to which I shall be willing to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell<span class='memberconstituency'> (Corby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Futher to the point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I am a practising barrister, and if you are prepared to rule me as in order, I might be able to provide the Committee with an explanation that is not entirely consistent with that given by my right honourable and learned Friend. Obviously this point is worrying the Committee, and I can give assistance if you will rule me in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The special concession negotiated by the Bar when VAT was introduced in 1972 or 1973 arose because a portion—about 40 per cent—of practising barristers relied almost entirely on legal aid fees for their income. Unlike other fees which other members of the Bar may receive, legal aid fees are not negotiated in advance. They are all determined by taxing officers of the courts in arrears. Therefore, when the work is done, the fee is unknown and may be unknown for a long time.<br><br>
However, a difficulty arose in that in order to secure taxation of a legal aid fee, barristers' clerks had to submit an invoice to taxing officers of the courts which would essentially be a negotiating ploy. In my experience, not once has a fee which my clerk has asked for been accepted by the taxing officers of the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Eggar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Enfield, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that he is not surprised.<br><br>
That means that the invoice did not necessarily relate to the fee that was subsequently paid. Of course, if the invocie issued became the basis for VAT, it would be paid not on the basis of the fee subsequently taxed and paid, but on the fee on the invoice that that was essentially a negotiating point. I believe that it was to get round this difficutly that the commissioners of Customs and Excise made a special concession to the Bar. I think that this is a unique concession—certainly it does not apply to solicitors—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making the mistake that so many people at the Bar make. They talk too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I sought to bring the hon. Gentleman's interesting contribution to a close, as it was out of order. However, I saw that it was of considerable interest to the Committee. The tolerance of the Chairman is being tried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can do what you suggested most wisely approximately five minutes ago,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0654">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
Mr. Leadbitter. Originally I suggested that this matter was in order. I tried to draw to your attention the connection between the argument about barristers and clause 32. Would you reconsider your ruling and allow us latitude to discuss this matter during the debate? That would facilitate me in giving way to the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell), who could then elucidate further on the point that he wishes to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair is bound to remain where it was at the beginning, and that is to say that the matter is out of order. May I say to the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell)—who sought to explain the position of the Bar arising out of' a legal aid agreement—that what he said was interesting. Indeed, the right to sue or not to sue is also interesting, but it does not affect the wording of clause 32.<br><br>
Clause 32 is specific, and makes the matter abundantly clear, saying that
<br><blockquote><p>"an insufficiency of funds to pay any tax due is not a reasonable excuse"</p></blockquote>
How that position is arrived at outside the Revenue is a matter for the parties concerned. What concerns the Committee is the entitlement of the Revenue to tax, and the existence of a shortfall, not on cash flow but on insufficiency of funds.<br><br>
I suggest that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) raised a point which appeared to be hypothetical, in any case. It would be in the best interests of the Committee if we sought how best to close the matter in a reasonably short time. There is still some elastic left, but not much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I am sorry to labour the matter, but it is an important point of principle, and barristers argued that an insufficiency of funds was a reasonable excuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) talked about 40 per cent of the business. What about the other 60 per cent? Further elucidation would help you, Mr. Leadbitter, to decide whether the matter is in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the hon. Gentleman stated that the barristers made the plea that an insufficiency of funds was an excuse, although the Bill says that that is not an excuse. That is the situation, and the Chair cannot see how to get round it. I suggest that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) accepts in good faith what the Minister said—that he will receive a letter explaining, in the manner the Minister described, the issues on which the hon. Gentleman sought an explanation. If he is not satisfied then, he can deploy any arguments arising from the letter on Report. We should now get on with the business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, may I state my opinion on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister can tell me why subsection (2)—
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of any provision of this Chapter which refers to a reasonable excuse for any conduct, an insufficiency of funds to pay any tax due is not a reasonable excuse"— </p></blockquote>
is in the Bill. Is it because people who are owed bad debts and who are being assessed for VAT on those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
debts have been pleading—perhaps there has been a court case—that they cannot pay the VAT because they do not have the money, and therefore have "an insufficiency of funds" to pay the VAT charge that is levied in them? This is a somewhat late stage for the Minister to explain the existence of this provision, when VAT has been in existence for so long.<br><br>
We come back to the old argument about whether VAT should be charged on bad debts. I speak as one who is long in the tooth as a member of Finance Bill Committees—in other respects, too and I remember Conservative Members in Opposition waxing eloquent—the eloquence was positively devastating in 1977 and 1978—about the plight of small business men owed money by people and charged VAT on that money. In the early hours of the morning, the tears rolled down their cheeks—including the cheeks of the Minister—and many an eloquent phrase was turned about the plight of those people. The Conservative party waxed lyrical on this subject in Opposition but has done little about it since it has been in power. It is important to know what legal judgment or practical problem has made it necessary to include the provision.<br><br>
6.20 p.m.<br><br>
The question of barristers comes into this. If the provision has been included because debts have been placed as a reason for unavailability of funds and therefore inability to pay VAT, the question arises whether we should vote against the clause. The argument for voting against would be strengthened if there were an unreasonable exemption of one section of society on grounds that, as explained by the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell), appear to me to be totally inadequate. We are talking about 40 per cent of the fees only in legal aid. It may be shocking to relate in this professional context, but many of the debts owed to barristers are in fact owed by solicitors. Were it still there, the ability to sue for debts that barristers once had I think in the 1950s—and have subsequently lost or given up, would be exercised mainly against solicitors, causing an internecine war within the legal profession that it would give many of us pleasure to watch.<br><br>
Indeed, I should add that my own Legal Profession Reform Bill—which I shall be asking leave to introduce on 11 June—will give barristers the power to sue for their fees. It is essential that they should have that power, not only if we are to see a vigorous civil war within the legal profession, but if we are to strengthen the position of barristers.<br><br>
Why has the provision been included? If it is part of the argument over bad debts that no section of society and no particular profession should be given the special privilege that we have discovered this afternoon—I certainly did not know of it before—is accorded to barristers, it is important to know. If it is a special provision in that sense, it strengthens the argument for voting against clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has just strengthened the support for his Bill on 11 June.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CHARGE OF INCOME TAX FOR 1985–86</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 33 reimposes the basic rate of income tax for 1985–86 at 30 per cent, leaving the higher rates of tax unchanged, but the higher rate threshold and income bands have been increased in line with the statutory income provisions.<br><br>
This year, the Government have merely indexed the higher rate threshold and income bands. That might appear unexceptionable, but the clause continues to benefit those who are better off, partly because it follows a series of changes to the higher rates and income bands that the Government have introduced since 1979. It is worth recalling briefly some of the changes so that we can understand their effects.<br><br>
In 1979, the top rate of personal income tax was reduced from 83 per cent to 60 per cent and the widths of remaining higher rate bands extended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ninety-eight per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) likes to parade his knowledge of taxation in <i>Accountancy Age,</i> but to suggest that it was 98 per cent is wrong as regards earned income. That would apply only if we took into account investment income surcharge on unearned income.<br><br>
In 1980, the rate bands of over 40 per cent were widened by £500 each. In 1981, the Government took a year off, making only special changes to benefit the better-off. In 1982, the higher rate bands were widened yet again. The full-year cost of that change was £160 million. That sum might seem small compared with the total amount of tax expenditures, for example, or even smaller when set against the total amount of public spending. Nevertheless, it is around the figure that the Opposition often ask for in increased public expenditure on schools, hospitals and the like, or for assistance with benefits—sometimes supplementary benefits—but it is never forthcoming for those purposes although it can easily be found to alter the higher rate tax band.<br><br>
In 1983 and 1984, the higher rate bands were again widened. In this year's Budget, the Government took another year off, making special provisions beyond indexation for the better-off. Presumably in the 1986 and 1987 Budgets the last before the general election—the Government will make further concessions to the better-off.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
That leaves us with the highest rate of income tax-60 per cent applying to those whose taxable income is more than E40,000 which is a substantial sum. That amount should be set in the context of current average male earnings. The latest available figure gives current average male earnings at £9,900 a year. When that figure is set against the taxable income of £40,200, which must be reached before one begins to pay tax at 60 per cent, one can see just how few people are affected and what they must earn before their income is seriously affected by the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. Will she tell the Committee at what multiple of average earnings she thinks that the 60 per cent rate of income tax should start?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will not expect me to anticipate the first Budget of my right honourable friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) in 1987.<br><br>
I was fascinated to see in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday, as, no doubt, were many of my hon. Friends, a list of the top 100 big league bosses and how much money they earned. [<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I do not think that my right honourable Friend earns £772,000 a year, as does the chairman of BOC. I thought that it would be interesting to take a selection from that group and, by way of illustration, look at how they have benefited from the successive changes in the higher rates of taxation since 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way? My hon. Friend referred to the £772,000 salary paid to Mr. Dick Jordani, the chairman of BOC. On 6 June, when the Public Accounts Committee publishes its report on the British Oxygen contract with the National Health Service for the supply of oxygen and equipment, hon. Members may find out why British Oxygen can afford to pay such a ludicrous and disgustingly high salary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I am sure that he has whetted everyone's appetites for the coming report. We shall study it with great interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady becomes involved in an attack on individuals and reduces the debate to that level, will she tell the Committee how the level at which higher tax is paid compares with other western industrialised countries? She has told us that the top rate of income tax starts at roughly four times average industrial earnings. What is the relevant figure in the rest of the EEC and the United States, for example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that point because I would rather concentrate on the differences that this Government's measures have made to the income of the top 100 in this country. It is much more important to focus on that matter, especially in view of the lack of contributions of some of those people to our economy. That is not a personal attack. It merely looks at the income which they earn and at the difference that has been made in their tax burden by the successive changes in the tax structure, or earned income, by this Government since 1979.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Eggar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Enfield, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may give way to the hon. Gentleman later, but I wish to give a few illustrations. To do so, I must make slightly arbitrary assumptions. One must assume that these people are claiming only the married man's allowance and, in one instance, this is even odder because the person is not married. However, I am sure that the Committee will forgive a somewhat arbitrary assumption of that kind.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
Obviously, other personal allowances would be claimed by people in this group, but, as we have no knowledge of their individual tax affairs, we cannot possibly cite them. If we consider the chairman of BOC and assume that the 1979 tax provisions applied, plus indexation, we find that the tax saving for him for 1985-86 amounts to £172,000. For Tiny Rowland, the tax saving is £68,000; for Mr. Harvey-Jones it is £60,590; for Lord Rayner it is 01,000, and Mr. Peter Levene saved £22,410 by the changes in the tax regime. Those are enormous savings in taxation, brought about by the successive alterations to the higher rate bands and thresholds which the Government have introduced since 1979.<br><br>
For example, the saving of the chairman of BOC equates to the average earnings of, say, 17 men a year. In Peter Levene's case, it drops to the average earnings of about two men a year. Enormous savings in taxation are going to people who really do not need them and that is in contrast to the sort of changes in taxation that have been made by the Government for those who are least well off.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary was good enough to provide a detailed table of those changes in a Parliamentary answer dated 5 March 1985 and it is based on a multiple of average earnings. It does not relate to male earnings, but to mulitples of average earnings. In each case for single people, married couples and married couples with two children both under the age of 11, on half average earnings, two thirds of average earnings and on average earnings, the tax burden, consisting of both income tax and national insurance contributions, has increased since 1978–79. The table is set out in full in the Financial Secretary's reply.<br><br>
However, the picture becomes quite different if one considers those receiving five or ten times average earnings and it shows that there are substantial reductions in the tax burden consisting of tax and national insurance contributions. For example, for a single person on five times average earnings in 1978–79, it dropped from 52 to 45. For married couples on five times average earnings, it fell from 50 to 43. For married couples with two children, it fell from 48 to 42. A similar picture emerges for those on ten times average earnings.<br><br>
The Government will say that real income tax cuts have been made since 1978–79. Our complaint we have raised the issue once again on clause 33 and it cannot be raised too often—is that much of the money that the Government have given away in tax cuts since 1979 has gone to the richest taxpayers. Tax cuts amounting to £4.5 billion have been made since then, almost half of which has been enjoyed by the richest 5
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
per cent of taxpayers. Again, almost a third of the sum was for a tiny minority—the richest 1.3 per cent of taxpayers.<br><br>
I have mentioned some of those earning more than £50,000 who appeared in the list given by <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday and who received almost one-fifth of the he amount in question. There can be no justification for such a totally unfair distribution of the money which the Government are prepared to dissipate in tax cuts.<br><br>
Sometimes Conservative Members pretend that such a policy is adopted to encourage the innovators and investors in our society; that argument is occasionally paraded on the Tory Benches. But we should have seen the fruits of that in the past six years. Instead, the total number of people employed dropped from 25 million in June 1979 to 24 million in December 1984, and of course there are many other indicators in that respect. If the original principle behind the Government's embarking on that course of reducing the tax burden of those with above-average earnings—and especially that of people whose incomes are well above average and who form only a tiny minority of taxpayers—we should examine the empirical evidence for their action. Again, if it is clear that such an incentive policy has not worked, in that investment has not increased, employment has been reduced and manufacturing industry has declined, and so on, it should be thrown into reverse. The Government should be prepared to increase taxation on the better off and to decrease considerably the burden on those who are worse off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady advancing the proposition that tax increases are a way of solving the unemployment problem? Will she go further, and say that in the unlikely event of there being a future Labour Government they will restore tax rates to the levels that existed before the 1979 Budget? If not, why is she so coy about advancing her party's policies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened a little more closely, he would have realised that I was asking how the Government could justify decreasing the tax burden on the better off while increasing it on the worse off. The reply might be that it would create jobs by encouraging innovation and investment. But plainly that has not worked, as the current state of our economy shows. I believe that what we should look for primarily in taxation is a fair distribution of the burden.<br><br>
I have already answered the second question of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst): I cannot predict what will be in my right honourable Friend's Budget two years hence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Gentleman asks his right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary and his hon. Friend the Financial Secretary whether they can anticipate what will be in the 1986 Budget; I know what sort of response he will receive. The hon. Gentleman should not ask me such silly questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady say whether, in proposing a fairer system of taxation—which seems to imply a considerable increase in the tax burden of the better off—she shares the definition given

by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) in an interview with Tribune two weeks ago? He said that the people whom he called the rich were those
<br><blockquote><p>"who earn £20,000 a year … they are bloody rich."</p></blockquote>
Does she recommend that anyone who earns £20,000 a year or more should pay a lot more income tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been nice if the hon. Gentleman had continued the quotation, which contains a comparison between those who earn £20,000 a year or more and his constituents who live in an inner city area of Birmingham suffering from urban decay.<br><br>
Let us continue the comparison. I am quite happy to do that as I should like to consider it more objectively. In a written answer in <i>Hansard</i> of 29 November 1984, columns 585–8, there is a survey of personal incomes for the years 1982–3. Unfortunately, it is the most up-to-date survey of personal incomes available from the Inland Revenue, but it shows the context in which we are discussing the distribution of taxation. Of course, the figures will have increased somewhat since 1983, but, out of 22 million incomes, there were 638,000 incomes of £20,000 and above—that is, total income before tax—which is a very small proportion.<br><br>
Conservative Members would do well to read an article in the well-known socialist newspaper, the Sunday <i>Telegraph,</i> dated 19 May 1985, which has some extremely interesting comments on the subject. When I quoted the figure of £9,900 earlier, I had a rough update of the average male earnings. This article does not use a similar update. I shall read a paragraph or two from it. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Statistics support Mr. Hattersley. The average gross weekly earnings, according to the Department of Employment, are £170.80 per week, which is just under £9,000 a year. The figures do not include the self-employed. Ninety-eight per cent of male manual workers earn less than £300 a week (or £15,600 a year) and for male non-manual workers the percentage is 86.8."</p></blockquote>
The writer of the article, who is perhaps more honest than Conservative Members said that he had woken up in the morning to find himself.
<br><blockquote><p>"among Mr. Hattersley's opulent 15 per cent."</p></blockquote>
If one is realistic about how little other people earn, one can see that, when we talk of individually earned incomes of £20,000 a year and above, we are talking about the minority of the better off. Assuming that many Committee members earn a little more than their salaries as Members of Parliament, I suppose that most of us in the Room are in that group.<br><br>
It might be rather a shock to realise—as the writer of the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> article honestly admitted he was—that one is amongst the minority of the better off. If Conservative Members, especially those who represent seats which they will probably lose in the next general election, knew about the incomes and standards of living of many of their constituents, they could know that they were much better off than many people.<br><br>
However, I shall not rely simply on the sort of subjective comparison which I have quoted. To talk about incomes of £20,000 a year and above is to talk about a minority of people who are better off and whose incomes are much higher than average. It is time that Conservative Members faced that fact and thought about what the Government have done to distribute the burden of taxation over the past six years.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Jackson<span class='memberconstituency'> (Wantage)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is to be commended on her honesty, as is the right honourable Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley). But there was a slight element of confusion in what she said. She talked about individual earned incomes of £20,000, but I understood that the right honourable Member for Sparkbrook made it clear that he was referring to household incomes. Could she spell that out to us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not rely on such an unreliable male chauvinistic source as <i>The Times</i> leader, which referred to joint incomes. That was not the view expressed by my right honourable Friend the Member for Sparkbrook. The Labour party is committed to disaggregating the earned incomes of married couples. We know that the Government have similar plans for the income of married couples being taxed jointly, in the way in which the hon. Gentleman's question implied, but the Government have only got as far as issuing a Green Paper. I played a part in the production of the Green Paper issued by the Labour Government in 1978 and I know what a difficult problem it is to disentangle the incomes of married couples in a way that is fair to everyone.<br><br>
However, it is sufficient for me to make the point that we are not talking about joint earned incomes and that The Times leader was wrong, yet again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eggar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady's party in favour of transferable allowances, as explained in the Budget speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question directly, because my party is in the process of examining the fairest way in which to disentangle and phase out the married man's allowance. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that that is difficult. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a straighter answer than that at the moment, although it is an important point to clarify.<br><br>
By way of contrast—and I know that many of my hon. Friends are anxious to deal with this topic I have drawn the Committee's attention to the distribution of the real income tax cuts to the better off. The poorest one fifth of taxpayers have between them received only 3 per cent of the cumulative tax cuts. Their income tax cuts average only 38p a week, compared with £225 a week for the richest taxpayers.<br><br>
Such glaring inequalities cannot be tolerated by the Opposition. The Government should, in all honesty and decency, consider the way in which they have distributed the tax burden over the six years of their period of office. The Government should not continue to give such enormous handouts to those on incomes well above average earnings, including my earlier examples of Tiny Rowland, Harvey-Jones, Lord Rayner and the chairman of BOC. Those people do not need the thousands of pounds that the Government have dished out to them individually.<br><br>
Such people receive incomes beyond most people's wildest dreams as it is, and there is no justification for that handout. I know that next year's Budget cannot be anticipated, but we should like to know that the better off will not receive such concessions in future. They do not need it. They have not used it to the benefit of our country, the unemployed or our industry. There is no justification for it, and it is high time that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0658">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
Government abandoned such grossly unfair, indecent and in just financing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify one point to which the hon. Lady referred earlier. She said that the reference to incomes over £20,000 related to individual incomes. In today's <i>Daily Express,</i> the office of her right honourable Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) is quoted as confirming that the £20,000 did not relate to individual incomes, but to household incomes. Will the hon. Lady advise the Committee which of the two statements is the policy of her party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. He has obviously been asleep for the last 10 minutes when I spelt out our views. The hon. Gentleman was wrong and I explained why. He should pay auention to the rest of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Yeo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the whole Committee is grateful to the hon. Lady because what she said was a repudiation of the official Labour party spokesman. His office is quoted in the <i>Daily Express</i> as saying that the right honourable Member was talking about £20,000 household income. Rather in the manner that we saw a few weeks ago on the question of mortgage interest relief, a statement has been repudiated on the same day that it was published in the <i>Daily Express</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to dwell on the points which my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) made so succinctly. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I realise that Conservative Members have little to say, but it is an unfortunate way to behave in Committee if they do not allow free speech. We have seen many examples of that with the fringe elements of the Conservative party trying to deny free speech to many people. Recent publications from organisations such as the Federation of Conservative Students, who, I understand, have friends in Committee, show that they do not attach a strong priority to free speech. I was disappointed at the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock has been treated in Committee. I always think that those who do not have an argument always resort to bully-boy tactics. We have seen the equivalent of Millwall football supporters on the Conservative Benches.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock put forward a strong argument for both social and economic priorities. She said that the Government's policies must be judged in moral, social and economic terms. I should like to comment on the moral implications of the Government's policies. The tax cuts have benefited the rich and the very rich.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I will make a few points and then I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to intervene. The tax cuts for the rich and the very rich are on record. My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock omitted to say—perhaps because of the. of her argument—that many people have been condemned to not paying tax as a result of the Government's policies. That means that the comparisons which are used are false, as they exclude the 3.5 million people who are unemployed and who, virtually by definition, will not be taxpayers.<br><br>
The Government have shifted the burden of taxation away from the very rich—their usual policy—but they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
have also shifted the burden of wealth by creating mass unemployment, thus creating greater inequality now than in 1979. We condemn the Government because that is morally wrong. Moreover, society believes in frivolous expenditure—an attitude probably encouraged by many Conservative Members—rather than believing in expenditure on housing, social security, the National Health Service and so on.<br><br>
An article in <i>The Standard</i> on Tuesday evening seems relevant to the debate. It referred to a 21st birthday party held by Viscount Althorp which cost £100,000. Compared with the incomes of many in my constituency, the money received by 30 families of social security benefit claimants.<br><br>
The article mentions that the party attracted many people from show business, the arts and politics. Moreover, the right honourable Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) was there, and he is quoted in The Standard—a much better researched newspaper than the <i>Daily Express</i>—as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"I love a good party and I have had a dance. But I'm not saying who with although there wasn't much competition from the House of Commons."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that meant that the right honourable Gentleman sought dancing partners in the House of Commons. The right honourable Gentleman is then reported as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was a delightful party because there were very few grown-ups."</p></blockquote>
That comment reminds one of the economic policies of the Conservative party.<br><br>
The next quotation in the article was from actress Cleo Rocos, who will be known to many Conservative Members, and who
<br><blockquote><p>"appears in the Kenny Everett show."</p></blockquote>
She must be a keen supporter of the Conservative party. The lady said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has been a fab … party and we walked barefoot in the rose bushes."</p></blockquote>
Surely, that shows how many intellectuals were there. No wonder the right honourable Member for Chelmsford enjoys such parties.<br><br>
The article in <i>The Standard</i> attracted my attention when I first read the newspaper. I am making a serious point. I hope that you were not invited to the party, Mr. Leadbitter, because, if so, perhaps we should withdraw some of our remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a little difficulty in relating my hon. Friend's remarks to the debate on the clause, which is about earned income. How can anyone earn £100,000 by the time he is 21? Would my hon. Friend care to speculate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to go too far into that issue, as we are discussing earned income. I use the article only to show the gross inequalities in society. I assume that the party was paid for out of income earned from much hard work. I make no judgment. I merely highlight the disparities between some of the problems confronting my constituents and a "fab party" offering the opportunity of walking barefoot in the rose bushes. Many of my constitutents may have to walk barefoot, but not necessarily in the rose bushes.</span></p>
