	<div class='title'>RELIEF FOR DISPOSALS BY INDIVIDUALS ON RETIREMENT FROM FAMILY BUSINESS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 214, in page 61, line 37, after " of " insert " at least ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 206 to 210, 215 and 211 to 213.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 214 seeks to achieve consistency in the clause. In two instances the words "at least one year" are used, and in another instance the words " one year " appear, the "at least" having been left out. There should be consistency throughout the clause, an damendment No. 214 achieves that end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next group of amendments—Nos. 206 to 210, and Nos. 211 to 213 relating to schedule 17— deal with two issues on which the Bill as published did not quite achieve what Ministers intended. Under the terms of the existing relief, which was introduced in 1965, an individual can get relief on such a sale of shares only if he is a full-time working director of the company whose shares are being sold, but for many years the Inland Revenue, by a published extra-statutory concession, has allowed relief if the company in which the shares are sold is a member of a group or commercial association of companies and the individual is a full-time working director of any one of those companies, or of the companies taken together. The amendments ensure that the new statutory relief will reflect that concessionary practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments also relate to directors of family companies who retire " partially ", in the sense that they cease to work full-time. They get relief for sales of shares when they filially retire altogether, so long as they were over 60 when they ceased to work
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
full-time and the part-time working involves at least 10 hours a week. Those are important conditions. Under such circumstances the amendments seek to ensure that such an individual will get the full relief at an appropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that although the amendments have a relieving provision compared with the clause as it stands, they do not add to the total relief that an individual can claim of the £100,000. That is inviolate and cannot be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Oonagh McDonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to ask the Minister about the full-time working director and the part-time director working for a minimum of 10 hours a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, the Opposition welcome this relief I know that the Minister is aware of that. On the other hand, we do not want the complex provisions of the relief to be used for tax avoidance purposes. Can the Minister say what evidence or proof will be required, particularly in the case of the part-time director? A minimum of 10 hours a week has been set, but that is not a large slice out of a week. It may also be difficult to establish that 10 hours work has been done by a part-time director. We want to know what proof the Inland Revenue is looking for, especially in the case of the part-time director.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come back to that. As far as I am aware, the requirements will be along the same lines as the requirements that revenue departments generally have for this sort of provision. An Inland Revenue civil servant will not follow the chap around wearing a false beard and a dark hat pulled down over his eyes, but I think that the individual concerned will have to make a statutory declaration that he is fulfilling the conditions, which is what happens when we fill up our income tax returns. We have to make that statutory declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were doubt in the minds of those in the Inland Revenue, or if information came to them that in some way the provisions were not being properly followed, they would look into the matter in the normal course of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to deal with the group of amendments and I come now to amendment No. 215, which is a consequential amendment on the replacement of the existing capital gains tax retirement relief provided by section 124 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 by the new provisions in the Bill. As far as I am aware, it is consequential and I hope that the Committee will accept it in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about amendments Nos. 211 to 213, which are linked with amendment No. 214. They provide that for retirement relief purposes, a taxpayer may elect to disapply provisions elsewhere in the capital gains tax code which provide that a reorganisation of shares or securities is not to be treated as a disposal for CGT purposes. The effect of giving this right of election to the individual will be that the reorganisation can count as a disposal and, as a result, retirement relief will be available on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>445</span>
This is a technical point to ensure that the sort of reliefs suggested by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will be properly carried through. I think that I have covered all the amendments in the group, but I shall try to answer any questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Kingston upon Hull, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) about tax relief for directors of family concerns who partially retire. On the terms of the existing relief, we seem to have got it wrong. Through extra-statutory concessions, the Inland Revenue has had to amend the working of the legislation. I am worried by this loose bit of legislation which has had to undergo this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although this matter is probably covered in other bits of legislation, I should like to discuss it, as I am perturbed by how the arrangement works. Statutes require the directors of such family concerns to make a statement just as we do with our normal tax returns. They have to bear the consequences if they are found not to be adhering to the rules laid down for the definition of partial retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the fact that we are referring to directors of family concerns raises some questions. Although a director will have to make this declaration and sign the bottom of the form saying that it is a true and honest report of the facts that he is a director of a family concern and working more than 10 hours a week at a certain age; it is difficult to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be easy to prove age, by providing birth certificates, but I cannot believe that there is any way in which the Inland Revenue can prove that a person is working more than 10 hours a week. We are contrasting a family concern with a large company—perhaps a publicly quoted company. The Inland Revenue could write to such a company and reasonably rely on getting an accurate report of the number of hours a person has worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, these family concerns could be very small businesses, and I am worried that the provision is open to abuse. I should appreciate it if the Minister would respond to the point about abuse in respect of a family concern and the 10-hour-per-week rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no opportunity for abuse, as far as I am aware. One of the other conditions is that the individual concerned has to be over 60 before he goes on to the part-time regime. Therefore, if he retires at 60 he is entitled to relief. It is all tied up in the magic of the wording. The relief is not available to a person who has worked part-time all his life. It is available only to a person who attains the age of 60 and decides to continue on a part-time basis. The provision protects that entitlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. However, does not the Minister agree that there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
could still be abuse? If a person is working part-time and has to make this statement, his family could agree on the 10 hours a week, or substantiate answers to questions that the Inland Revenue asks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly look at that problem and discuss it with the officials concerned to see whether there is any possibility of abuse. If so, I shall take steps to ensure that it is eliminated so far as is humanly possible. I gladly give the undertaking to make those inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions about amendments Nos. 206 and 207. I can understand why they have been tabled. Obviously there was an omission from the clause. I simply wonder how the Government managed to leave out the qualification in the amendment, because many companies must be members of a group or association of companies. This issue could arise in the case of illness of those involved in the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is already a complex provision. The fact that the Government have to amend it at this stage causes us to worry whether they have now got it right so that it applies only where they intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are responding to the theme of our Finance Bill Committee debates both last year and this year, that we should reduce the number of extra-statutory concessions as much as possible and, where appropriate, include them in the legislation. We appreciated rather belatedly that this matter could and should be provided for. Therefore, this published extra-statutory concession, which has operated for many years and has been the subject of criticism—certainly from the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher)—has been incorporated into the legislation. It is rather complicated legislation, but it is better that the measure be included in the law of the land than that it remain an extra-statutory provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(10) For the purposes of this section agricultural land (as defined in subsection (2) of section 115 of the Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984) which is owned by an individual shall be deemed to have been in use for the purposes of a business carried on by the owner for any period during which the land was occupied for the purposes of agriculture by the owner or by another and the letting of such

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>447</span>
agricultural land shall be deemed to be a trade carried on by the owner and paragraph 10 of Schedule 17 to this Act shall not apply to a, disposal of such agricultural land.".</p></q>
The purpose behind my amendment will, I am sure, excite the approbation of all members of the Committee, although we may differ on the means of bringing about this desirable end. The amendment seeks to encourage the more widespread letting of farms by private individuals. At present it is accepted that there is a disincentive to the letting of land and the Government have done a great deal over the past few years to encourage in various ways, landowners to let land. For example, they have extended capital transfer tax relief to agricultural landlords; they have abolished the investment income surcharge, and last year they brought forward the Agricultural Holdings Act. All those measures were extremely welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It now appears that capital gains tax is the major fiscal discouragement to the letting of land because the agricultural landlord is denied rollover reliefs and retirement reliefs if he lets the land rather than takes it in hand and farms it himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, if accepted, would be a step towards fiscal neutrality between the owner who lets his land and the owner who farms it himself. Without such a balance in the tax system, opportunities for new tenants will be lost, because, inevitably, owners will continue to be advised—as they have been for some time—that they should take farms in hand when tenancies become vacant. I believe that to be having a markedly deleterious effect upon the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One particular type of landlord suffers considerably from the present capital gains tax regime: the farmer who, on his retirement, does not sell his farm, but lets it to a tenant. On a subsequent sale, he is denied the retirement relief which he had previously earned from farming the land himself, on the ground that at the date of the disposal he is no longer carrying on the business. Clause 65(3) provides that the business must be
	<br><q><p>"owned by the individual making the disposal".</p></q>
At that point the farmer does not own the business, only the land, and, ultimately, and consequently, does not qualify for the relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the vast rise in land values in recent years—principally due to the common agricultural policy, of which I am not known to be an enthusiastic supporter—the difficulties that face individuals coming into farming are almost insurmountable, and for that reason, we must enable people to take up tenancies where they cannot afford to buy land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the farmer, the exemption is likely to be most important in relation to the value of the land itself, as that is the major asset of the business and is, therefore, the asset on which the capital gain to be taxed will be made. It cannot be right that an exemption which had been earned and which could have been used if the farmer had chosen to retire and sell his land, should not be available if he does something that we all regard as desir-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
able. If he lets his farm to a tenant, he loses the relief completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that they wish to encourage the letting of land, and this is one way in which they could achieve their objective. At present it is very unusual for a farmer to let his land on retirement. Professional advisers would inevitably say that, desirable as it might be on business grounds, the tax consequences for the value of the estate would be disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I encourage my hon. Friend to look favourably on the amendment and to allow retiring farmers to consider letting their land instead of selling up completely, or else struggling on when they are unequal to the task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist responding to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). I understand what he is saying about the loss of relief if a farmer lets rather than sells his land, but we must decide what our taxation priorities are. This is yet another example of the Government palming money towards the rich at the expense of the less well off. Last week saw the abolition of the land development grant, which means £50 million a year for land and property speculators; now we have an amendment advocating further tax relief for the farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that there is no such thing as a poor farmer. I was brought up on a farm during the war, as my mother's family were farming people. Now—although not for much longer—I live in a farming area in Worcestershire. We see a lot of crocodile tears in the farming industry, particularly among members of the NFU, which I consider to be one of the most powerful lobbying organisations in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what my hon. Friend said about the profits accruing to farmers from the EEC. Does he agree *that the NFU engages in a form of lobbying by direct debit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a beautiful way of putting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1985, we still have an industry which is subsidised. Let me make a comparison. I am sure that all hon. Members are tired of speaking and hearing about the coal industry, but pits have been closed because accounting analyses supposedly suggest that the industry would otherwise have to be subsidised. Almost no industry has been subsidised to the same extent as the farming industry. It does not stand alone; it does not have to respond to the market forces advocated by the hon. Member for Tatton, because it has a floor in the markets and can overproduce. But now the hon. Gentleman is asking for more relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will accept that I am at least consistent. I have always opposed the system of managed markets which exist within the CAP. It has not been good for British farmers, let alone for British consumers, in the long run, as the dairy farmers in my constituency have discovered to their cost.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>449</span>
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, all that is irrelevant to the purpose of my amendment which is not to give a further tax relief to farmers because, at present, that would not be its effect. There is a tax disincentive to letting land so it is not let; retirement relief is claimed anyway. I seek not to increase the cost to the Exchequer, but merely to make the system more flexible so that we can encourage greater letting of land. I do not believe that that would impose a cost on the Exchequer, but it would make it easier for people who otherwise could not afford to buy a farm, to take up farming. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that as a desirable objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot argue that there would be no cost to his amendment. We are talking about relief. Any form of tax relief involves money moving from the Exchequer to the business concerned. That argument does not stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately the Committee has to decide whether the money that is available in the Exchequer should be distributed in this way and whether priority should be given to this industry. There have been remarkable changes in the industry, in particular the growth of fewer but larger farms. I support the hon. Member for Tatton on one point: if the present arrangements encourage the trend towards fewer but larger farms there will be two serious consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the environmental issue. We are removing hedgerows, which has a serious effect upon wildlife, particularly on the east coast. We now have prairies in East Anglia and that is a worrying development. Secondly, there is the destruction of communities. The trend towards the larger farm has resulted in more mechanisation. We all appreciate that it is necessary to be productive these days to compete; that is not in dispute. However, communities and villages are dying. Village schools are closing as there are no children because the farm workers are moving out. We are now even hearing about village post offices closing. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has such communities in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that the amendment should be rejected. The farming industry does not deserve it. As we have seen from the CAP, millionaires are being created as a result of the grain policy alone. Too much money has been made by this highly over-subsidised and totally protected industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly concerned. The Labour party believes that some of our basic industries should be subsidised and protected. If one industry makes our case for us to some extent it is the agricultural industry. Before the war it was highly depressed and received no subsidy. People were flocking off the land. Since then it has been turned into a highly prosperous industry by Government subsidy, Government protection and Government planning—three things with which the Opposition agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. I shall not pursue this point in too much detail lest I go wide of the mark which I am anxious to avoid. I think that it was the 1947 agricultural legislation which created the environment for the investment which has given Britain a very competitive and efficient industry. Before the war we literally had a peasant farming industry such as there was in France and parts of Germany in the 1950s and early 1960s.

We do not disagree in principle or from an industrial point of view with the notion of subsidy and of helping the industry as suggested in amendment No. 101. However, we should give greater priority to manufacturing and other industries, which are so crucial to the generation of wealth for this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should reject the amendment as something else emanating from the farming lobby. They see us as an easy touch. I hope that the overwhelming majority that the Conservative party has on the Committee will not be abused to shove even more wealth from the less well off to the very rich, as we have seen during the past five years. We are all tired of it, and people are catching on. If the amendment were passed it would be the last straw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise the Committee to reject the amendment. Its cost is difficult to estimate, but I am advised that it is in the order of £5 million. Its effect would be wider than my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would extend capital gains tax retirement relief to, disposals of let agricultural land by landlords who had reached the age of 60, or who had retired for reasons of ill-health below that age. There would be no need for them to have farmed the land. The amendment would merely extend the relief to someone who owned the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing retirement relief, to which we are making modest changes, applies only to assets used in a trade, profession or vocation, office or employment. When the consultative document was issued early last year, it was suggested that relief should be extended to investments and, in particular, to investments consisting of residential or agricultural property. The Government did not feel it appropriate to implement those representations. My hon. Friend's amendment would go at least part way in that direction and extend relief to assets held as investments rather than to assets held as part of trade, profession or vocation, office or employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no justification for giving relief for gains realised on the sale of assets held purely as investments and not for business use. That would go way outside the relief that we are discussing. I have heard no compelling arguments so far in favour of treating let agricultural land differently on this issue from other assets held as investments. I advise the Committee to reject the amendment, although I hope that my hon. Friend will see fit to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

should be rejected on grounds of logic. If he applies that test to our entire tax system he will have to table vastly more amendments than I have. I do not mean this remark personally, but my hon. Friend should remember that
	<br><q><p>"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds".</p></q>
I am disappointed that my eloquence has not persuaded my hon. Friend, notwithstanding the fact that the amendment would cose a mere £5 million. Surely £5 million to get me to shut up would be cheap at the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend is so warmly supported by Opposition Members, I apprehend that if I press my amendment to a Division I shall not succeed so, as discretion is the better part of valour, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a number of queries to raise on clause 65. First, I am sure that the Minister has received many representations on clauses 65 and 66 and the accompanying schedule. Although I do not normally go along with the pleas of chartered accountants, the Law Society, and so on, nevertheless one small plea is worth a response from the Minister. Previous legislation covering retirement relief is scattered throughout several Acts and measures, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants writes:
	<br><q><p>" Bearing in mind the extensive range of concessions which were previously relied upon in this area, we suggest that it would be helpful to publish a statement of 'destinations and derivations' so that any changes which have made to past practice can be readily identified."</p></q>
That seems to be a useful suggestion. The Opposition go along with recommendations to simplify tax rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question arises from clause 65(2), which provides that a disposal of business assets includes, inter alia,
	<br><q><p>"a disposal of the whole or part of a business, or</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) a disposal of one or more assets which, at the time at which business ceased to be carried on, were in use for the purposes of that business ".</p></q>
When a business is carried on by a partnership, it is to be treated as owned by each individual who at the time of disposal is a member of the partnership. What would be the position if an individual retired from the partnership and the business continued? Will the Minister clarify that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) further refers to a disposal of business assets to include, among other things,
	<br><q><p>"a disposal of shares or securities of a company",</p></q>
and subsection (5) defines when a disposal of shares or securities is a " material" disposal. The share capital of a company will often be held partly by a holding company, which will qualify as an individual's family company, and partly by the individual himself. In such circumstances, while relief would be available on the disposal of shares in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
family holding company, no relief would be available in respect of the sale of the individual's shares in the subsidiary company, because the latter will frequently not qualify as a family company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain whether, in those circumstances, the individual would be able to obtain relief in respect of the disposal of shares both in the family holding company and in the subsidiary company? It would be useful to know whether those two subsections apply in such a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 65 also touches on the case of an individual who retires below the age of 60 on the grounds of ill health. I believe that the Minister has received petitions from various interested groups about the possibility of appealing against the board's decision. As the matter is now the subject of an amendment to schedule 17, I shall not now deal with the one or two minor points that I had intended to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 65(2) provides that the relief will apply to the disposal of qualifying assets, not only to disposals made by way of sale or gift. Will it apply to, say, gains arising from insurance or compensation sums revealed? I repeat that the Opposition do not oppose this retirement relief. We merely want to be sure about what it covers, so it is important that the Minister tells us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause embodies some aspects of existing practice, it would be useful if the Minister told us what costs will arise from extending the retirement relief to cover ill-health. I realise that that is difficult to quantify, because no one knows how many people are likely to become ill. But he must have some idea, and it would be useful to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome clause 65 and the new relief that it provides—both the full relief which is to be available at age 60 and the relief that will be given to those compelled to retire at any age through ill-health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that I am the parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald), which the institute also made, about complexity of the provision, and the precedents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury's notes on the clause point out that the new provisions take account of the extra-statutory concessions and statement of practice associated with existing relief. If a statement of destinations and derivations could be given to the Committee, it would be most helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue intends to publish an explanatory leaflet putting this into language which most of us will understand. I accept fully the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) about the desirability of making the language that we use for tax provision as easily understood as possible by as many of our fellow citizens as possible. When it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>453</span>
is not possible to do that in statute, it is important that the Inland Revenue does its best, in leaflets and explanatory documents, to make its intentions clear. I am glad that both revenue departments have won awards from the Campaign for Plain English for the clarity with which they produced leaflets and documents. I only wish that such clarity shone through the whole of the parliamentary draftstmen's regime and into the Bill, but we can always hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the detailed points made by the hon. Lady, the provisions of clauses 65 and 66 and the associated schedule will extend the relief, and lower the age at which it is to apply from 65 to 60. At present, there is a tapering arrangement between ages 60 and 65. That is to be eliminated and the provisions will apply to a person who retires at age 60 or over. They will also apply to someone who is forced to retire through ill-health. I noted what the hon. Lady said about requests for some sort of appeal mechanism. We will, as the hon. Lady said, debate that when we come to the next clause and schedule 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
he hon. Lady asked about the cost of the ill health provision. I am afraid that this is an occasion on which the experts have shrugged their shoulders and felt that they could not put a figure on the measure. We may be in a better position after the measure has been in force for a while to give an answer to a parliamentary question if the hon. Lady cares to pursue the matter in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock also asked about subsection (2). I understand that relief that is available if the partnership carries on will be available for someone leaving the partnership. In the case of a holding company, mentioned in subsection (5), I am advised that the relief is probably not available. However, the words used by the hon. Lady will be studied carefully and I or my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will write to her on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked what would happen when insurance was involved. I understand that those circumstances will be covered. Bearing in mind those explanations, I hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendment seeks to alter the Bill, it does not seek to alter the existing practice. I seek to ensure that retirement relief is available in relation to assets which are held outside the business when there is a partial retirement from that business. At the moment, that is an extra-statutory concession given by the Revenue and that is valuable. I should like to see that concession incorporated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Treasury will know, there is a distinction, for capital gains tax purposes, between assets of the business and those which are used for the purposes of the business, but do not form part of it; for example, the partnership assets. It is common for land to be farmed by a partnership, but only one of the partners may own the land and it may not be held as a partnership asset. If, with increasing age, for example, that land-owning partner decides to withdraw from the business, he may dispose, or seek to dispose, of only part of that interest in the partnership. He will be eligible under existing law, and under the Bill's proposals, for relief on that proportion of the partnership's assets which is attributable to him. For those assets which, although used for the purpose of the partnership do not actually form part of the assets of the legal partnership, he will not qualify for retirement relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why the relief should be restricted by what is allowable at the moment. The question whether particular assets should be held as part of the partnership or retained outside it is a matter for the partners themselves. In certain circumstances, it may make economic sense for the assets to be held by the partnership and in other circumstances it might be the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong that tax consequences should have to be borne in mind when the legal form rather than the substance of a business organisation is under discussion. There can be no fundamental policy objection to relief being available on a partial retirement, because that is permitted, in any event, on a partial disposal of the business. I see no fundamental policy objection to relief being extended in some cases to assets which are held outside the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State why the rules for the disposal of assets held outside the business should not be the same as for those in it, as at present. It is fair to point out that the exclusion of relief for assets held outside the business, in cases of partial retirement, goes beyond the codification in which I thought we were engaged and amounts to a tightening up of the rules. If my hon. Friend will refer to the current Revenue booklet CGT 8, he will find the existing rules delineated and there seems to be a simple system which has not been subjected to widespread abuse. It would be deleterious to the interests of many businesses if we were to tighten up in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister of State minded to continue the existing practice and incorporate that into law rather
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>455</span>
than to make what I believe, is a rather unnecessary change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I issue a word of warning about the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton)? I should love to know what interest the hon. Gentleman has. Perhaps he is looking for sponsorship from the NFU. Today we have had mention of farming and at our last sitting there was discussion on dressing for dinner. I do not know what next week's whim will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the hon. Gentleman was right to say that it is quite common for farms to be run on a sort of common ownership basis. As I said earlier, the trend towards bigger and fewer farms and exploiting the economies of scale has accentuated the trend which has existed since the war. It has accelerated rapidly since the introduction of the CAP when we moved away from a cheap food policy to a more expensive food policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the notion that we should treat the disposal of those assets, and the relief that would accompany it, within a company and outside it in much the same way, would be open to abuse. It seems to me that we would need to define an asset held outside a company and I am not sure where that would be listed. If it were a substantial company, would it be listed in the annual report? I should not have thought that it would, because there would be no statutory obligation to do so. Certainly, it would not be normal accountancy practice to include within an annual report of a company assets held outside it; I repeat that I am not sure where such assets would be listed and I believe that this proposition would be open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for Tatton will tell the Committee what motivation is behind the amendment. He seems to be angling, yet again, for tax relief and continuance of that trend, and to be serving the interests of the farming community in a powerful way. Although he has lost some of his amendments today, I am most suspicious of all the amendments and the filibustering by the hon. Member for Tatton. Indeed, I am surprised that the Government Whips have not taken him to one side and roughed him up, so to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems as though we shall need to have our time for debate extended; the hon. Gentleman appears to be causing much trouble and disruption and his amendments to be serving certain interests, although I cannot quite see whose. However, if previous experience is anything to go by, they are the interests of the landowners and the powerful, at the expense of others. Why does not the hon. Member for Hatton try to ensure that the money involved goes to the nurses instead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that amendment No. 102 is unnecessary, as the word " withdrawal " is capable of meaning both complete and partial withdrawal. The underlying point about the extra-statutory concession that has been available in the past is fair, but it is subsumed by Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
amendment No. 216. The matter at issue relates to the relief for disposal of business assets associated with the disposal of interests in partnerships or of shares in a family company. For example, a man might sell out his interest in a farming partnership and at the same time sell the land that he owns personally and which the partnership is farming. Clearly, it would be reasonable to give retirement relief in those circumstances. But the ceiling on that relief is the £100,000; none of the provisions alters that. We are ensuring that the entitlement to that relief is exercised reasonably and fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 216, which I hope the Committee will accept, would be to make clear that the associated disposal relief will be available when someone disposes of his business or shares in stages and when the withdrawal with which the disposal of the asset is associated is a partial withdrawal. Subject to the limit of £100,000 still applying—that is absolutely basic to the changes being made—I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) will feel that he can ask leave to withdraw his amendment, which is unnecessary, and that the Committee will accept amendment No. 216.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of points for clarification about clause 66. First, subsections (3) and (4) relate to trustees. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that the relief will also apply to disposals by trustees of settled property, which under subsection (3) consists of
	<br><q><p>
	<ol>
	<li>"shares or securities of a company, or</li>
	<li>(ii) an asset used or previously used for the purposes of a business",</li>
</ol></p></q>
provided that there is a beneficiary of the settlement who has an interest in possession other than an interest for a fixed term in the assets disposed of and himself satisfies the normal conditions for relief, as already discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In determining whether a company is an individual family company for this purpose, any voting rights exercisable by the trustees will be deemed to be exercisable by the individual family and will thus count towards the existing 51 per cent. test. This is on the condition that the individual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
and members of his family are sole beneficiaries of the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If both the trustees and the qualifying beneficiary make qualifying disposal on the same day, relief is to be given to the beneficiary in priority to the trustees. I shall be grateful if the Minister will confirm that that is the way in which the relationship between the trustees and the qualifying beneficiary will work out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other question concerns subsection (7)(a) and the meaning of
	<br><q><p>" withdrawal of the individual concerned from participation in the business".</p></q>
It might happen that the partner retiring from full-time activity continues to have an involvement on a part-time or a consultancy basis for some years to ensure that the business. is handed over smoothly to the continuing partners or to dispose of part of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous statement of practice did not contain that requirement and I want to know what in this context is meant by the
	<br><q><p>" withdrawal of the individual concerned from participation in the business".</p></q>
Is that total withdrawal, and does it exclude the activities I have described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Lady's second point will surely be partly subsumed in what we said about people working part-time previously. At least in one of the examples the hon. Lady gave, of someone who ceased to work full-time but continued to work in a part-time consultancy capacity, that would be so and I am advised that in subsection (7)(a) partial withdrawal is not excluded by these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only one query about the question of appeal over retirement from work on grounds of ill-health. Suppose someone suffers a stroke or serious heart attack, takes retirement and finds to his surprise and perhaps that of the medical profession that he recovers, and when he wants to get involved again in the family business. If he had taken retirement relief in the belief that he would remain permanently incapable of taking part in the business, what would be his position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I advise the Committee to accept it along with the associated amendment in the name of my right hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendments a taxpayer would have a right of appeal to the special commissioners on the question of whether he was entitled to retirement relief because he retired on grounds of ill-health. The original formulation of the clauses excited a fair amount of comment that there should be a right of appeal. Although an advisory committee of doctors within the DHSS would be involved in professional judgments of this sort, where there was a conflict of professional judgment, it should be determined by a semi or wholly judicial body. The right of appeal to the special commissioners will provide that. I hope that the Committee will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) mentioned the person who suffers from a severe illness and then recovers. I am advised that a person gets the relief when he retires. If he then recovers and returns to business, I am delighted to say that the Inland Revenue will not try to snatch the relief back. As to whether that person would be entitled to come again, the answer must be no, because the rigid limit of £100,000 will apply. If the person had claimed only £50,000 on the first retirement, could he claim the outstanding balance at a later stage? I must confess that I do not know, but I shall certainly find out and write to the hon. Lady. I will circulate my response to all Committee members if they so wish.

The purpose of the amendment is to backdate the relief for those who are compelled to retire from business below the age of 60 because of ill health. The Inland Revenue consultative document, published in March 1984, identified the problems of a person compelled to retire early on the grounds of ill-health. In foreshadowing capital gains tax relief in these circumstances, I seek to persuade the Committee that there are precedents for backdating a new relief—for example, furnished holiday lettings —for those who have to retire early on the grounds of ill-health. It should be backdated to 6 April 1984, or at least not after the publication of the Inland Revenue consultative document on retirement relief.

I cannot estimate the number of cases that would fall to receive relief were the amendment accepted. I do not imagine that there would be many.

Friend said, the purpose of the amendment is to extend relief to individuals who, for reasons of ill-health, are compelled to retire under the age of 60, and to take back the effective date for that from 6 April 1985 —as in the Bill—to 6 April 1984. All the other proposed changes in the Bill would apply from 6 April 1985. That would be slightly strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand my hon. Friend's argument that people who retire because of ill-health during those 12 months will feel aggrieved at not qualifying for this relief. He will understand, I am sure, that if we were to agree to the date of 6 April 1984 the person who retired because of ill health on 1 April 1984 or 31 March 1984 would feel equally aggrieved. Wherever the line is drawn, the people just on the wrong side of it feel aggrieved. It is inevitable, whatever starting date is chosen, that some taxpayers will just fail to qualify. They will think how unfair life is, and in particular how unfair the law is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded that this case is so exceptional that some retrospection should be made. In those circumstances, I advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment. I hope, in any event, that my hon. Friend will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 217, in page 154, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>" (4) Where a claim for relief in accordance with this Schedule is dependent upon an individual having retired on ill-health grounds below the age of 60, the claim shall be made to the Board.".—[	<i>Mr. Hayhoe.</i>]</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 156, line 29, leave out paragraph 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10 of schedule 17 excludes or limits retirement relief in the case of assets outside a partnership where previously there was a non-business use, or where a rent has been charged. There seems to be no logical reason for excluding farmland owned by a member of a partnership, but which is farmed by the partnership itself, and in respect of which a rent is charged and received by the partner who owns the land. However, paragraph 10(1)(c) effectively prevents retirement relief being claimed when that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, the land is still very much at risk from the owner's unlimited liability. Just as partners in a business share the profits, so partners bear the losses. So the rental received is no more than a part of the global profit and loss sharing mechanism in any partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other mechanisms that are more favourable in regard to tax treatment can be, and doubtless are, adopted from time to time, but in such circumstances there seems to be a risk that what would normally be regarded as a commercially sensible arrangement is not entered into simply because of the tax consequences that would flow from it, and that is a bad principle to introduce into business affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rightly set their face against giving capital allowances in general simply because the forms of investment that were undertaken were often done for tax reasons rather than for commercial business reasons. The tenor of my amendment falls fairly and squarely within the desirable objective that the Government have set themselves in other parts of the Bill and in the Finance Act 1984.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good business reasons for accepting the amendment. If a commercially sensible arrangement is not entered into and is disguised for tax reasons, there is a risk that will tm he financial information reaching the partners wibe distorted, which will in turn affect their business decisions, probably for the worse. The exclusion from relief of assets in respect of which a rent is paid seems to owe more to that happily vanished period when a Labour Government were in charge of the nation's affairs.. There seems to be no political or fair reason why this Government should adopt the same approach or why there should be an inconsistency in capital gains tax, when the Government have sought to remove it in relation to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>461</span>
The second circumstance in which paragraph 10 applies is where assets have been used for non-business purposes during part of the taxpayer's ownership although at the date of the disposal they are in the ownership of the partner concerned. There is a lack of symmetry here, too, which unfortunately is to the Revenue's benefit, as there is no provision for an apportioned relief where the asset was at some earlier time in business use but which ceased substantially before the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important point which I hope Opposition Members will attend to, because there is a possibility of considerable injustice being done. Paragraph 10(1)(a) and (b) are too widely drawn because they require account to be taken of business /non-business use of the asset for the whole of the taxpayer's ownership. That can include periods before 1965, when capital gains tax was first introduced. In fact, even war service between 1939 and 1945, which prevented a taxpayer from qualifying under the rules laid down in schedule 17, could prevent a taxpayer from claiming the relief. That would be a considerable injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the board has a discretion in view of the problem that arose on pre-1965 gains in relation to section 148 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 which deals with maintenance funds. That was corrected by section 68 of the Finance Act 1984. Can my hon. Friend say how pre-1965 events will affect the board's view of what is, just and reasonable in these circumstances? If he cannot do that now, perhaps he will write to me in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) is at it again. I did not want to speak much more this evening, but I feel obliged to respond briefly on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is looking for tax relief for farmers, or even owners of land, because he is worried that the renter of an asset would not get the relief that he would like. His arguments do not stand up to detailed investigation. The hon. Member said that he wants symmetry. What a vague way of putting an argument in favour of giving tax relief to landowners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the injustice of the existing arrangements. Earlier I mentioned the case of the nurses. We should talk about injustice in cases where people are deprived to the extent that they cannot afford to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's arguments do not stand up to detailed scrutiny. He suggested that commercial and business arrangements could not be entered into because the owners of the land assets could not get the return that they would like, so that there was no 'incentive to let the land. It is remarkable if the hon. Gentleman is saying that a commercial arrangement can be strictly commercial only according to the criteria that he chooses, providing that there is a subsidy from the Exchequer. One can make any business deal work if one has a subsidy from the Exchequer. The hon. Gentleman talked about sub-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
sidies earlier tonight and last week, and I suspect that he is asking for subsidies again in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has made a good point. The hon. Member for Tatton claims to be a free market man, a member of the Institute of Directors and a Thatcherite. Yet when it comes to particular interest groups, he ducks and weaves. I thought that such a person would believe that one should pursue the ideal blindly, with one's head down, whatever happened and irrespective of the consequences. We see now that he is a pinko—that is the only way in which to describe him. Private Eye has already written something about him, but if it got hold of this story, it would describe him as an ultrapink. He is trying once more to get subsidies for the farming industry, and we do not accept that. He has got to get his priorities right. Under the next Labour Government, which I am sure is not far off now, we shall not allow such nonsense to come before the Committee, or we shall vote it out with no equivocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the past two years we have had the benefit—as some might call it—of the presence of the hon. Member for Ta:tton (Mr. Hamilton) during our proceedings. Last year and this year he has been moving the same kind of amendments, all of which would cost the Exchequer money. As I recall, there was a period during last year's Finance Bill Committee when we costed one of his amendments at £120 million or £135 million. Clearly he is not Right-wing when it comes to preserving Treasury resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Minister to adopt what I hope will be the attitude of Treasury Ministers when the next Labour Government is elected. I hope that they will deal with any of the hon. Gentleman's amendments of this nature with two words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all this talk of Labour Governments, I must confess that I am unable to peer so far into the distant future as to contemplate such a tragedy occurring. I merely confine myself to what is likely to happen within the next decade or two. I am afraid that I must tell my hon. Friend that over the next decade or two what his amendment proposes would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of the clauses is the retirement relief, which is intended to recognise those individuals who have invested all their capital in their business over a long period, and are now coming up to retirement, and we think it appropriate that a relief be accorded to them. The clauses do not seek to give relief to someone who has used his money as an investment rather than as an asset employed in the course of his business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) seeks in this amendment is similar in context to what he sought on clause 65. The amendment, in seeking to remove the restrictions on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>463</span>
the relief for the disposal of assets used in a company or business partnership, but owned separately by the partner or director concerned, would open the way to giving relief for assets which were held as investments. That is not what retirement relief is intended for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a provision would demonstrate the absence of rules and make it possible for the arrangements to be manipulated and tax to be avoided. My hon. Friend has had in this amendment another try at getting something which he has already given up. I can understand his persistence, but I hope that he will follow his own example and withdraw amendment No. 103 also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ned Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) is picking on me as he is. As the underdog on the Committee, I thought that I would have excited the compassion and support of the Labour party. I am surprised and disappointed to see the heartless attitude adopted towards me by the hon. Gentleman and by his hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). I know that the hon. Member for Workington is a mild-mannered individual as a rule, and kindly disposed towards furry animals and others picked upon by those bigger than themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious purpose behind my group of .amendments, although I have no interest to declare. I farm in Cheshire a third of an acre of meadow which, if cut, would be called a lawn, but I have a large number of tenant farmers among my constituents. As a result I have had to grapple with many of the difficulties facing the farming fraternity. The vast majority of farmers are not the barley barons and companies farming 10,000 acres of Lincolnshire. The average farm in my constituency is relatively small—80 to 100 acres. The farmers are people whom I would expect to excite the compassion and support of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of the accusation of filibustering which has been levelled at me, but I want to make clear that this is a serious attempt to help small businesses, and, in particular, family businesses, out of the problems that the tax system creates for them, and to prevent the unreal regime introduced by a tax of this kind from biting adversely upon them. I am seeking to persuade the Committee that we must look through the legal form of the Bill in its real content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what my hon. Friend said in response to my amendment, and agree that amendment No. 103 goes wide in removing paragraph 10 from schedule 17. I hope, however, that it may be possible to construct a system whereby the assets outside the business but used for the purposes of the business are related to the business itself, that some sort of relief may be introduced without our opening the door to abuse. Appreciating as I do that it does not achieve that effect, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ASSETS DISPOSED OF IN A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is quite a complicated clause, although no doubt the Government will claim that it is designed simply to overcome deficiencies in section 151 of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979. The Act was defective in two respects. First, it did not apply if the fragmented assets were transferred to different persons, for example, a husband and wife. Secondly, it did not give a time at which the aggregate market value of the assets was to be taken, although the Revenue held that it should be the time of each transfer after the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 151 is now to be recast in relation to gifts or other transactions made after 19 March 1985. If by a series of two or more transactions made after that date, but falling within the same six-year period, a person disposes of assets to one or more persons connected with him, and the separate market value of any asset disposed is less than a pro, rata proportion of the aggregate market value of all the assets disposed of, the higher value is to be imputed to all such assets comprised in that series, and treated as the consideration for the disposal and corresponding acquisition. Clause 67 makes it necessary to calculate and recalculate the separate market values and aggregate market values of the assets disposed as each disposal in the series occurs, and additional assessments or adjustments will be made accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight, the clause seems to tidy up the previous legislation and overcome its deficiencies. The problem is in the background to the changes made in capital taxation. Here I must refer briefly to capital transfer tax, to changes already made in capital gains tax and to the clause in the Bill which abolishes, stamp duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one wants to avoid capital transfer tax, one must give away one's assets over a period of time. After a 10-year period the gifts, whatever they may be, fall out of accumulation and further gifts made after that period are not subject to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, the Government introduced holdover relief for capital gains tax. That reduced the tax that a person pays. A later clause in the Bill abolishes the stamp duty on gifts inter vivos previously levied at 1 per cent. of the value of the assets given. That abolition reduces the cost of avoiding capital transfer tax, as most CTT avoidance arrangements depend on making gifts during life, either direct or via a trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>465</span>
If we take all these things together, as we must to understand what is going on or can go on under clause 67, we see that the following situation could arise: a father could give away gifts which consist of shares totalling 80 per cent. of the family company. He has two sons and he gives away 40 per cent. of the shares to the elder son who already owns 20 per cent. of the shares and 40 per cent. of the shares to his second son. Let us suppose that the 80 per cent. holding was worth £80,000, but that the 40 per cent. holding was worth only £20,000. Each gift by the father would now have a deemed sale price of £40,000. Let us suppose that he takes advantage of the provisions that we have just discussed so that he gets retirement relief and pays no tax on the gifts to his sons. Each son will now have a deemed cost of £40,000 for an asset worth £20,000. One is building in a saving in capital gains tax when the second son eventually sells because of the level of cost ascribed to his asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one way in which the clause might be used to avoid paying capital gains tax. It also depends on how the gifts are given. If they are given in a series of transactions, outside the six-year period, with a seven year gap in between, for CGT purposes each of those gifts will be looked at separately and that will reduce their value. By introducing the six-year period and by taking account of the other tax changes that have been made, the change, for from tidying up the previous legislation, could open up further possibilities for tax avoidance. Rather than being a tax-saving measure by the Government, it could cost tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My suggestion may be wrong, of course. If it is, those points would need to be clarified to that we can see whether this is a measure by which the Government will further reduce the impact of capital taxation. Furthermore, one of my reasons for looking at the clause with a suspicious eye is a feeling that the Government do not like capital taxation and would rather get rid of it. This has not been done by abolishing it in one fell swoop which would obviously be quite unacceptable. The Government could not get away with that, although they are trying to get away with all sorts of extraordinary measures at present. However, they would find it difficult to explain to those who owned capital in the form of shares—those who are plainly among the better off—that they were doing away with the tax regime in terms of taxation on the assets that people own or give away or that accrue during their lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of doing that, the Government have made all kinds of changes, both in capital transfer tax and in capital gains tax. Were the Chief Secretary here, I suspect that, if my interpretation of the clause is acceptable, he would not be at all unhappy about it. The Chief Secretary does not like capital taxation and has said that he would like to get rid of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the changes are being made in such a way that they will destroy the effectiveness of capi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>466</span>
tal taxation. If that is not the purpose of the clause, the measure is rather carelessly drawn and does not achieve the Government's objective, which is to overcome deficiencies in existing legislation. If the clause does not achieve that objective, it opens up the possibility of more tax avoidance. The Minister should explain exactly what he intends to -achieve by the clause, whether my interpretation is correct and why the Government are including the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than follow the paranoia of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) may I raise a query on one small part of the clause—lines 17 to 18 on page 68? I have heard two, interpretations of the words in brackets, neither of which is wholly satisfactory. If my hon. Friend the Minister cannot reply immediately I shall be happy for him to write to me later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words in brackets may be meaningless or they may inadvertently raise additional taxation by including in a series of transactions a transaction between husband and wife which would otherwise have been exempt. Unless I have misunderstood the words in brackets, their effect may be to treat such a transaction as taxable if it occurs as part of a series.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) identified two important questions on the clause—first, why is it in the Bill and secondly, does it achieve its objective? I was interested in her observations because the Institute of Chartered Accountants has reached a different conclusion on what the clause achieves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know the object of the exercise and I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend's explanation. The institute said:
	<br><q><p>"We are most concerned as to why it should have been considered necessary to introduce this legislation. We would have thought that the existing provisions in section 151 CGTA 1979 largely cater for any avoidance, and the case for further legislation has not been made out."</p></q>
The institute's conclusion is that the object of the exercise is anti-avoidance. The hon. Member for Thurrock asked whether, if that was so, the clause achieved its objective. This is a complex provision that is difficult for a non-lawyer to comprehend fully. I cannot offer the Committee an opinion on either question. It would be unrealistic to ask for a simple explanation, but it would be helpful if my hon. Friend could give the Committee some explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to agree with much of what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said. We are dealing with a complicated problem because assets have been fragmented and distributed to prevent people from having to pay CTT and CGT. We know that new mechanisms are always being introduced to help people who want to give their assets to others, usually within the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman because I do not know whether this complicated legislation, which seeks to deal with that problem, will work. The rules seem to cover two or more material transactions that are linked. We have to decide the date
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>467</span>
from which material transactions could take place, the number of people involved, and the period within which such transactions become liable to tax. The six-year period was referred to earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, we have to decide when transactions have taken place—this relates to the 19 March 1985 date. When one transaction has taken place before that date and another after, one transaction will be deemed to be part of a chain and the other will not. It is very complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we create something complicated, trouble is inevitable. I like simple solutions. I do not fully understand what is being done and I feel intuitively that we are creating a provision that is susceptible to abuse. It will be administratively complicated to implement. Yet perhaps such legislation is needed because of the techniques used by accountants who are invoking new methods of fragmentation within families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am doubtful about the provision and I suspect that next year we might be shoving through Government amendments to ensure that those who should pay tax are paying it. We should not create a monster of a system which could intensify the opportunities for abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with every hon. Member who has referred to the complexity of these matters. I share their feelings. It is a complicated matter, but perhaps those who have lived with it for a long time know the ins and outs of it. However, we are all agreed on its complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) referred to the words in brackets at the end of subsection (8)(b). He had been wise enough to table an amendment to delete the words, but subsequently, he withdrew that amendment from the amendment paper. I had intended to tell my hon. Friend that I entirely agreed with him. If he had made his argument, we should have got rid of those words from the Bill. I shall drop a hint. If my hon. Friend tables the amendment on Report, there will be a high chance that opinions will not have changed by then. There is some confusion. It would be better for the words to be removed from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wider question, I shall try to explain the intention behind the changes in the clause. The way in which the present law has been acting has generated some criticism. In a parliamentary answer last December, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary implied that he was unhappy about the present state of the law and was examining various ways in which it could be improved. He had in mind the possibilities of avoidance under existing legislation and also the curiously arbitrary nature of the way in which it could work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present law applies where a person receives assets from two or more close relatives and the market value of the assets taken together is greater than the value of the assets when they are considered separately. One example is the transfers of individual minority shareholdings in a company which, together, would form a majority shareholding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>468</span>
In such a case in existing law, an additional charge may arise on the transferors when the shares come together in the hands of one person. That might take place over a long period. The transfers might come from many different sources. Therefore, there is a certain arbitrariness about it. Someone receiving a gift suddenly discovers that a new tax charge has been generated by that gift. Rather harsh results can be produced for an innocent party by some transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no time limits in the existing provision. Therefore, in theory at least, the law can apply to transactions that are separated by long periods. The law is ambiguous about the date on which the aggregate market value of the assets is to be taken, which can be extremely serious as major changes could take place in the value of an asset. The provision is not comprehensive. Moreover, I am advised that the tax could be avoided fairly easily by those who can obtain good professional advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of those criticisms, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary thought it right to discover whether the tax could be made more effective, less avoidable and more certain in the way that the provision would work. The proposal would re- structure the provision rather than try to patch up the defects in the existing section 151, which in itself is complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provision will apply when assets are fragmented rather than, as now, when they are brought together. As I have said, under present law, small gifts to one person can suddenly exceed the total which gives that person a majority shareholding in a company and thus make the overall value of them greater than if they were considered as separate items. Therefore, there could be an extra tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal before the Committee is that the tax will be charged on the basis of the assets being passed away. Even if an asset is passed away in chunks, and a 60 per cent. shareholding, for example, is split into three 20 per cent. shareholdings and given to individuals, the tax on the total 60 per cent. shareholding would be higher than the tax charge on the individual 20 per cent. amounts. That illustrates more closely the provision's intention, which is to prevent avoidance by the piecemeal transfer of assets to close relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is useful because it brings the capital gains provisions into line with the comparable capital transfer tax provisions. It also introduces time limits, so that the provisions apply only to transactions that take place within six years of each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that anyone would suggest that what I have described is a cast-iron, easily understood and simple solution to a complicated problem. But it has been very carefully thought through as better than the existing arrangement and less subject to the capricious falling of taxes on individuals merely because they get gifts from different sources. It makes it clear that if someone disposes of an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>469</span>
asset by splitting it up, the full tax charge will therefore be paid, which should render some of the avoidance techniques null and void.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with those thoughts in mind that I recommend the clause to the Committee. I have come to this subject fairly late and I appreciate the complexity of the matters involved perhaps better than anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that the clause is an attempt to tighten up the provisions for capital gains tax. Nevertheless, the real problem lies in the introduction of the six-year limitation. It is obvious that just as people plan the transfer of assets to avoid capital transfer tax, one could transfer assets over seven-year intervals, not six-year intervals, and thus avoid the sort of aggregation about which the Minister has spoken. That is the real difficulty and the reason why the Opposition think that the Government should reconsider the clause and bring forward amendments on Report to prevent that new means of tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a tax regime that is as sensible and clear as possible, but which does not inadvertently introduce a new method of tax avoidance. We shall therefore vote against the clause to show the Government that we wish them to reconsider it and see what can be done about the six-year limitation. The clause makes it too easy to plan the disposal of assets—it probably applies much more to the disposal of shares than to the disposal of other assets—to, avoid capital gains tax which might otherwise be due. We are extremely concerned about the new provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>470</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I gave a brief outline of the background to the clause, as no amendments to it have been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 68 essentially seeks to change the tax treatment of profits from certain future and traded option contracts and to treat the profits as capital gains rather than as income. It applies to profits arising from transactions in commodity or financial futures which are not trading—I stress, not trading —transactions. Under present law, these profits would normally be taxed as income under Case VI of schedule D.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will ensure that in future such profits or losses—will be treated as capital and taxed under capital gains tax under the CGT rules. Gains and losses from traded options, including options in futures, will also be subject to CGT unless the transactions amount to trading. With one exception, the new treatment will apply only to profits on futures contracts which are closed out before delivery by equal and opposite matching transactions. The exception is contracts such as the FT-SE 100 index contract which provide on expiry for cash settlement. The new treatment will apply to those also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change is being made mainly in response to representations by the exchanges and their association that the existing tax treatment of futures has been acting as a brake on the development of the United Kingdom futures markets. Case VI is especially disadvantageous, as it may involve a liability at rates up to 60 per cent., and it restricts the scope for set-off of losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed less onerous treatment should help in two ways. First, it will attract more investors to the markets, which will improve their liquidity and efficiency. Secondly, it wifacilitate the hedging of financial risks by ensuring that the tax treatment of the hedging transactions is the same as that of the underlying security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change will encourage generally a greater use of the markets. It has been widely welcomed by the markets and by will those who use them—quite under- standably. It help the markets develop and meet the needs of users at home and abroad of this important and growing area of the City's services. The Government regard it as especially important that United Kingdom exchanges should not be at a disadvtage in this highly competitive area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may wish to ask about the cost. It is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of the change. It is likely to be very small, but it is possible that the CGT yield from increases in investment activity which should flow from the change will exceed the current yield under case VI. Perhaps that will help the Committee as a brief introduction and give the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) a chance to catch her breath legitimately. I will, of course, respond to any other points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was my intention to refer to the admirable notes on clauses which set out extremely well the changes resulting from clause 68. I can understand why the commodity and financial

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>471</span>
futures markets have welcomed the clause. The Minister seems to think that the fact that they welcome it, and the fact that an extension is to be made, especially in the financial futures market, is a good thing. I am not quite so sure, especially as regards the financial futures market, which benefits from exchange rate instability, because people take a bet on future exchange rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from that, I want the Committee to consider the reception given to the change in this tax regime. After that, in the light of one of the circulars that I have received perhaps the Financial Secretary will explain why he thinkg that the cost is expected to be very small and why he claimed that the capital tax yield might exceed the yield under case VI, because that is not how speculation in commodities is being presented by those who engage in facilitating such speculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from the circular from LHW Futures Ltd. It mentions a businessman named Mr. Moulton who received an LHW business information pack and used it carefully. He invested £2,600—described as a sum which he could afford to lose, which in itself makes him luckier than most—in coffee. He did very well, and increased his capital by £7,742 in a little more than three months. That was the advertising claim, but who knows whether it is true? I imagine that it is a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular continues:
	<br><q><p>"What's more the last Budget"—</p></q>
that is the 1985 Budget—
	<br><q><p>"has made the tax situation with regard to profits highly favourable. The first £5,900 of profit can be completely tax free, and thereafter you pay only 30 per cent … which if you're on a higher rate of income tax that is highly beneficial. Best of all you can offset any losses made on other investments, such as shares, against your profits from commodities!"</p></q>
The advertising literature covers investment in all kinds of commodities and alleges marvellous profits made by people who have co-operated with LHW. Who can tell whether or not the advertising claims are true? However, the principle is clear: it is possible to make large profits in that way. It must be remembered that the first £5,900, which is roughly half average male earnings, is tax free in any one year. That is a substantial tax-free amount and certainly more than would be allowed on earned income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that changing the tax regime would make investment of that kind more attractive. His view was not entirely consistent because he claimed that it would make such investment more attractive and ensure that our markets were competitive in an international sense. At the same time he suggested that it might lead to an increase in taxation. Presumably he would argue that an increase in taxation from such speculation would make the market less, not more attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come off it! Those two views are not consistent. Presumably, more people would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>472</span>
Battracted into the market if the tax regime were lighter, and that would make the market more competititive. That would ensure that it was competitive with similar markets in other parts of the world. That is the Financial Secretary's point. He cannot say that and at the same time suggest that the tax regime, through being changed, might in practice lead to an increase in the yield. I am pointing out the conflicts in the Financial Secretary's remarks that puzzle me and I hope that he will clarify the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the measure attracts investment into such speculative ventures—the investments are entirely speculative—there may be less investment available for purposes which would lead to employment and to the expansion of our industry. That is the cost of the attraction of such investment to one source rather than to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CGT yield might thus be increased if the market expands by attracting money away from other investment. That might lead to an increase in the CGT yield because of the general expansion in the market. However, I assume that the reasons for the changes are to make the tax burden lighter on the individuals who participate. I cannot see any other reason for introducing a regime of this kind and altering the existing regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the statement by LHW Futures, where the change is welcomed as improving the tax situation with regard to profit and offering, on the basis of the last Budget, a bonanza for speculators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clause, for two reasons. First, it is important that there should be equivalent treatment within the financial markets in the city. That principle is one of those set out in the White Paper on the regulation of financial services, but I believe that it applies equally to taxation. It would make those markets more competitive not only within the City of London but internationally, and that, too, is most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not support the change because the markets wanted it, because, of course, they always want a more favourable tax regime. I support it for the reason that I gave and because I believe that it will result in an increase in revenue. Apparently, the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) cannot understand that concept, but if a tax regime at 60 per cent. is substituted by one at 30 per cent. and the level of activity rises by more than double as a result, the yield will increase. The matter is as simple as that. There is a very good chance of that happening, because I believe that investors were deterred or inhibited from investing previously, but the prospect will now be attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought the hon. Lady was right, but confusing two different issues, to warn about the dangers of investment in this area. That is most important, but that is not for the debate on this clause. It was mentioned the other day on the Floor of the House in the debate on the White Paper on financial services when I referred to LHW Futures Ltd., which is undergoing investigation by the fraud squad. Therefore, there is no difference between us on that point. Any investor—certainly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>473</span>
any uninformed investor—needs to be very cautious, but many sophisticated investors are able to take the risk of investing in this market. I believe that they will take this opportunity, so there is a very good chance that the yield will rise. Therefore, I strongly welcome the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister's speech with great interest. The proposed change away from income tax towards capital gains tax to give relief to those who deal in futures to ensure that transactions carried out in the London futures exchanges are competitive internationally is one that I understand the market welcomes. Such transactions are a fact of life, and one must accept that, but the markets deal in speculation in the sense that their transactions are gambles embarked upon by institutions, dealers and persons with money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who invests a sum of money does so in the hope of receiving a good return in future. I would prefer that our tax regime encouraged more investment in British industry rather than in futures and commodities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speculators operate in any market. There are people who invest for the sake of investment in any market. But if the hon. Gentleman is concerned about British industry, he should understand that those markets also service British industry. For example, it is most helpful for exporters to be able to hedge against currency movements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that and, of course, we know that large companies use their money in that way. That is why I said that such markets were a fact of life. But we are discussing giving tax relief to those who embark on those kinds of speculative deals, and the Minister made it quite clear that he did not know how much the scheme would cost. He said that it would be a fairly small sum, but he does not know what will happen to the yield under a capital gains tax regime rather than an income tax regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give us specific figures. He said that the United Kingdom rate could be as high as 60 per cent. Will he tell us how the futures exchange in Tokyo compares? What rate would one pay over there? How do the exchanges in France and Germany compare? It would be useful for the Committee to know the comparable figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case made out so far seems to be rather fragile and on shaky ground. Those who take part in the kind of casino transactions that we are discussing will naturally want to ensure that they pay as little tax as possible; that is understandable. But I am sceptical about the CGT yield. We do not know what it will be or what the transaction rate will be; it is as long as piece of strong. To expect that the yield would be higher under the new arrangement is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>474</span>
quite irresponsible; we do not know what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said that there should be fair treatment in this respect, which I understand, and that the measure would result in an increase in transactions. But he cannot put his hand on his heart and say that; matters are much more complicated. Essentially, we are debating the priorities of how tax relief is granted to various organisations, companies and individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept that we live in an international community and that we have to be competitive internationally, this is not a matter to which I give much priority. I appreciate that the futures and other commodity exchanges are over the moon about the clause, as it is a very attractive arrangement for them But I cannot get worked up about it and I would prefer that we gave tax incentives in other ways, to increase the country's wealth on a manufacturing basis rather than through the casino exchanges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should start by trying to bring the debate back to the realities of the world in which we live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was absolutely right to try to distinguish between the risks involved in certain aspects of investment—such as commodities or financial futures —the advice that should be given to people about taking them, and tax treatment. We should be considering whether that tax treatment is the right treatment for investment gains. I should point out the advantages to the country in terms of employment, foreign exchange, and so on, in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, three categories of people use the commodity exchanges. First, there is the dealing community; I shall give later the figures illustrating the large number of people employed in such work. Then there is the trade aspect, which the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) mentioned when he spoke about British industry. The word "trade" covers the many people who try to hedge their trade risks, which they could not do without the facility and ability of highly-sophisticated and skilled commodity markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third category—the only one that the clause seeks to address—is the investor. Competitive exchanges in other parts of the world have seen their trade expand massively in consequence of different tax treatments. We seek to put our investors on an equal base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should ask himself whether it is appropriate to see speculative gains charged on a capital gains or income basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
