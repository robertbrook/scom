	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to welcome you as Chairman, Mr. Leadbitter, for the duration of the spring incarceration of the Finance Bill. The Opposition were probing the basic rationale of the Government's priorities for imposing duties on the different beverages, such as beer, spirits, table wines and so on. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) that we are dealing with the Government's old fashioned game of "We need the money" syndrome. That phrase was coined so graphically by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1982. It is noticeable that he has been less graphic with his phrases since then because it was such a telling indication of what the Government were about. They need the money. They will get it from anywhere. They will get it by flogging off public property, spreading the burden of taxation in all sorts of insane and unnecessary directions, and from the annual notch up on the taxation on the pleasures of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, which promised, mendaciously, that they would reduce taxation, are now increasing taxes in all possible ways. In their effort to show that they have reduced direct taxes, they have shifted the burden onto indirect taxes and sold public property to make ends meet. It is a gambler's progress. It is a Government of fiddle, fudge and flog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply cast a strange light on the way in which such matters are decided in Government. The Government have a chance to adjust and influence social consumption patterns. The Government have the chance to plan a strategy towards industry, leisure and towards people's pleasures, but they have only compromised—a little bit on here and a little off there. The Minister said that the Government have to negotiate cleverly round Europe. Fortunately, the Euro-fun party is not present to hear him say that. Its policy towards Europe is to lie down on its back and have its tummy tickled. The Minister intimated the need to adopt a devious approach towards Europe and the need to adjust taxes without incurring displeasure. The Government have given a bit of pleasure to the Scotch whisky industry. There is an adjustment here and a trim there. That is all that there is to it. There is no rational decision about priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
It is time to ask about the Government's priorities towards alcoholic beverages. Perhaps it is pertinent to ask which alcoholic beverages that the Conservatives prefer. There is a deep social gulf between the Opposition, representing mainly beer drinkers, and the Conservatives, representing the gin and tonic brigade. [Hon. Members: "Nonsense".]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One pattern of consumption seems to prevail. When I was staying at the house of a spirit dealer in the southern States last year, I was told that the future lies with "white"—white wine and white liquor rather than with "dark", such as red wine, whisky and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the coming trend, and consumption patterns seem to prove it, there is a case for adjusting the taxation pattern to take that into account. But all the Government seem to do is adjust taxation on the basis of their own personal preferences as a party. Therefore, it would be desirable to hear tonight what those preferences are. The Trappist monk brigade on the Conservative Benches sit with their mouths permanently closed and their heads down, apart, of course, from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs Currie) who is bursting to give flow to her eloquence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) were a little cruel--certainly they betrayed touches of male chauvinism—towards the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South because I have to admit that when the hon. Lady came into the Committee Room I had an irresistible desire to stand up and bow to her in a formal courtly fashion because she looks so lovely tonight. I mean that absolutely seriously and since I know that our previous Chairman, Miss Fookes, reads the proceedings of the Committee avidly, I should add that she also looked lovely, Indeed, Mr. Leadbitter, you also look lovely!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not crawl the kerbs for you, Mr'Leadbitter, in the same way in which I might be tempted in other directions, but the cruel comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington produced a note which I did not like to pass on—passing notes to each other reminds me of the sixth form at school—but I think that I should read the note from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South to her friend on the Opposition Benches because it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only thing that could be said about The Guardian is that no one reads it in my constituency."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we have an admission that the accusation in The Guardian that the hon. Lady harangued the station manager at Radio Leeds was indeed true and her only hope is that 	<i>The Guardian</i> does not reach anyone in Derbyshire, South. The note continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am much too wily to be tempted"</p></blockquote>
—[Laughter.]—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to respond to anything you say."</p></blockquote>
It adds,
	<br><blockquote><p>"But keep trying, it is fun."</p></blockquote>
I cannot vouch for that. However, I can ask, what are the alcoholic preferences of Conservative Members, particularly those of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South? What does one have with curry? I prefer lager, but I want to know the preferences of Conservative Members to find out whether they influence their attitude towards the taxation of drink which, from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
Minister's reply, seemed to be curiously unscientific and unthought out. My guess is that we have the gin and tonic brigade on the Conservative Benches against the Opposition's serried ranks of beer drinkers, who are obviously much more loquacious as a result of that varied experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever happens to the brewing industry, the brewers will continue to pour their money into the coffers of the Conservative party—the trade will provide. But the consequences of the Government's actions are felt in society and I shall briefly mention some which are affected by the clause and the distribution of taxation between different drinks. The first, as mentioned by some of my hon. Friends, is the effect on the social lives of people in the areas which we represent. Taxation on beer affects the social lives of people who go to working men's clubs which are their social focus and, indeed, community centres which provide various forms of social service and bring the community together on the profits of the beer they sell. Those profits will be influenced by this taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) and I were in China together recently where we saw a marvellous institution called the Workers' Cultural Palace which fulfilled much the same role as the working man's club, but without the alcohol. The profits from those clubs are threatened. The functions that they fulfil in communities are threatened by such taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a chance, in the taxation of alcohol, to influence the power structure, the company organisation and the framework of the brewing trade and the whole drinks distribution system. It is a chance that the Government have not taken. There is in that industry a wholesale process of concentration. Opposition Members believe that small is beautiful, especially in social centres such as the public house, off-licence or working man's club. But the whole pattern of the industry has been in concentration. There is a chance in the taxation of alcohol, through a differential system, to offset that process, which has produced a concentration of brewing and a bland nondescript product which does not serve the interests of communities or of the class that we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give as an example the threat posed by Scottish and Newcastle to the Matthew Brown brewery in Blackburn—it was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington which in turn took over the Yorkshire brewery of Theakstons. That is a threat to smaller units which have a tradition of local service, local routes and a local impact which none of the big brewers can have. That threat could be offset by a differential system of taxation. The Government have failed to take such an opportunity. Similarly, the concentration of off-licences in chains controlled by the breweries gives the breweries an unjustified power, indeed, a monopoly, in the retail distribution of wines, spirits and beer. That could be offset by taxation to achieve what the Government professes is in their heart: to help the small man who is running a small off-licence or free house who has been unduly discriminated against by the returns to scale in the brewing trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable that the Government have not taken the opportunity provided for within the framework of taxation to offset the tendency to concentration which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
gives the big brewer a stranglehold on the trade and is inimical to the real interests of the people whom we represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first Finance Bill Committee and I thought that in the interests of informed debate, especially on such a subject, that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury or his representatives would take us all out for a drink during the dinner break. I have been sadly disillusioned in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to Miss Fookes, who was in the Chair in our earlier sitting, for my intervention which nearly led astray my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall). I spoke about the fact that there are no rebates on water rates. I have just had a bill for over £80 water rates. That might seem to be a drop in the ocean to Conservative Members, but I assure the Committee that it is substantial to me. The water rate seems very high, too, to my constituents who cannot obtain a rebate, but who wish to drink water rather than alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our discussion on alcohol is very topical because it is relevant to my constituency Labour party. I think that it will become a hot issue in my general management committee. I attended a branch meeting last night at which a resolution was passed to try to stop the sale and drinking of alcohol during the general committee meetings, which are held at the local Labour club. I must confess I would not normally do so in front of Conservative Members—that it might create a split in my local party and it is likely that the committee will spend more time on that resolution than on the reselection process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alcoholism is a serious problem in many parts of the world. I was reading an article recently about the Soviet Union. It said that Mr. Gorbachev has stopped the serving of vodka at functions in the Kremlin. Reading more closely, I realised that he had stopped the official purchase of vodka and other alcohol for official receptions. That policy is more likely to undermine the Soviet state than anything that the CIA is likely to do. Soviet Ministers and officials have to buy their own drinks for receptions if they wish to imbibe in Government circles. There is a word for that, which is appropriate to another policy of this Government: privatisation. Perhaps it should be applied to British Government functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) have asked questions about such spending. The Prime Minister herself, in a recent answer, admitted spending more than £3 million on her own office expenses. I venture to assume that some of that goes on alcohol, and if it is added to other Ministers' expenditure, and they adopt the approach of having to buy their own, the Government will be able to make substantial savings, which is what they claim is their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alcoholism is a problem in this country. American soap operas such as Dynasty and Dallas have a bad influence on us. In Dynasty, the leading character is called Blake Carrington, but perhaps Blake Charring-ton would be more appropriate. As for his wife, Krystle, her name should be Crystal Decanter, because she is always drinking. The glugging in such programmes is not oil, but alcohol. I watched one of those programmes and counted the scenes in which the characters had a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
glass in their hands or booze was involved in some way. More than 50 per cent of the scenes in Dallas—this is perhaps an understatement had booze in them. This is a serious matter, because such scenes create undue influences on the public. They equate sophistication and great wealth with having a drink in one's hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee in which part of clause 1 Dallas is mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might have done better than that if the Financial Secretary had bought him a drink during dinner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are unduly influenced into thinking that sophistication and great wealth equal having a drink in one's hand, which leads to the spread of alcoholism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are at least three more ways in which the Government could combat that. The first is by influencing the buying policy of the BBC and ITV, so that they buy programmes which do not have that dangerous social implication. They could also put money into health education to stop alcoholism in a big way. The third way could be through their tax policy, which is what the clause is about, because it has an influence on alcoholism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. After dinner, there is always a degree of flexibility in the Committee which is quite right. I hope, however, that the hon. Gentleman will try to come back to clause stand part and perhaps still delight the Committee with similar anecdotal points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Leadbitter. I was about to mention the Government's tax policy and how it affects the pricing of spirits and all kinds of alcohol because it is important in combating alcoholism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making some good points. Perhaps he would care to emphasise to the Committee the dangers implicit in implementing the Budget proposals. If, because of the pressure due to the tax on beer, we are likely to see the Rovers Return in Coronation Street close, it would be one of the tragedies of the brewery industry in the north-west.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows much more about that aspect and I shall not follow him down that road or I shall be in trouble with you, Mr. Leadbitter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the Government have got the balance wrong in their tax policy on booze in general. In my view, the price of spirits should be increased, and beer and cider prices should be kept down. I believe that there should be special incentives for the production of real beer and real cider so that customers do not have to suffer from gassy drinks. Beer and cider are the drinks of the working man and after the terrible way in which he has been exploited by the Government and employers, he should at least have the little perk of a decent pint of beer or cider at a reasonable price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For women, the problem is a little more tricky and for them, wine is probably the best equivalent rather than spirits. I also recommend that its price be kept down. The advantage of that approach to beer and wine, as opposed to spirits, is that the volume that a person can drink comes into the argument. There is far less alcoholic intake when people consume big drinks, so that approach would be advantageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
I am also aware that spirits are the rich man's and rich woman's tipple in the main and, in the interests of greater equality and the redistribution of wealth, it would be better to increase the price of spirits. The consumption of spirits creates a problem because people's ability to pay should not be the sole criterion. I have a suggestion to put to the Committee although I have not worked it out in great detail. I believe that spirits should be shared out far more equally and I do not mean by rationing and queuing up because they create many problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would be quite reasonable for each taxpayer to recieve, say, 12 bottles of spirits of their choice a year, distributed by the Treasury. That would be the fairest way in which to distribute spirits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I have not worked out all the details but I can see advantages in that suggestion. First, taxpaying would not become a begrudged activity. Secondly, if taxpayers receive a bottle a month the Government will be setting a standard which is linked to moderation and that would be an important element. Thirdly, it would provide stability with its guarantee of output and jobs in the distilling industry. I throw out that idea as a suggestion for the Committee to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the real dilemma was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher). There is a dilemma in the taxation policy towards alcohol because of its effect on health. Something should be done for reasons of benefiting health as opposed to restrictions being imposed on people's pleasures. The Treasury seems to have combined laziness with cynicism. It is lazy because it is simplest merley to increase the tax and cynical in that it its main policy has been to maximise its revenue without concern for the social implications of that policy, and the Committee is due an explanation of which camp it is in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Treasury to improve health by attempting to reduce alcoholism or is it interfering with people's pleasures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, there must be a balance, but the emphasis should be on improving health, as many early deaths and examples of bad health are alcohol related. The numbers involved are huge, and the Treasury should fulfil its responsibility in maintaining public health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) referred to the overall increase imposed by the clause, which amounts to about E175 million this year and f180 million in a full year. Incidentally, the RPI effect of the increase is only about one-tenth of 1 per cent. The hon. Gentleman asked why there were differences between the increase of duty on different beverages in the Budget. To some extent, the percentage increases depend on what has happened in the past. As I explained, in the example of a pint of cider with roughly the same alcohol content as a pint of beer, the cider will go up by 1 p, or 10.6 per cent, while beer will rise by perhaps 1.5p, or 7.5 per cent. Of course, those buying drinks in pubs and clubs will be interested not in the percentage increase but in the actual increase and in the overall price that they pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hodge Hill pointed out, fairly, that production costs of cider are much higher than those of beer. These matters must be considered in the round; The Chancellor of the Exchequer must come to a judgment—taking into account the enormous number
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
of representations received from brewers, licensed victuallers, The Scotch Whisky Association and people in the wine trade and the port and vermouth trade, and from consumers and those concerned about the effect on health—while also bearing in the mind the European Community dimension about changes in the relative burden of taxation on different types of drink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has to examine the import and export implications of those changes and consider industrial and employment, as well as health and social, factors. No Chancellor would claim that his decision is the only reasonable one in the circumstances; it is a balance of judgment. That applies to all taxation measures. I am sure that our proceedings will be followed with great care by those who want to see what we as Members of Parliament have to say about the great industries in which they are involved. Indeed, what is said in our debates will be pored over, and certain conclusions will be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) asked about the average increase implied by the £175 million increase in take through these taxes. When it is weighted to take account of the different levels of duty, it is about 5.75 per cent. Then there is the yield increase, for which we must also bear in mind changes in consumption which may arise from the Budget, but which may occur in any event. Several hon. Gentlemen have pointed out that there is a changing pattern of consumption, of social behaviour and of the types of drink favoured. There is a trend in the trade towards an increase in lager drinking, and in consumption in the home instead of on the premises. All those factors give us a yield increase in the order of 4.25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members asked about exports, about the effect of the lower increase on spirits, and whether that would attract into the country large amounts of spirits from abroad. In 1983 a little over three-quarters of the spirits drunk in this country were home produced, with whisky being the lion's share. The imports were about 22 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about the balance of the spirits trade. I do not have a precise figure on that, but there is no doubt that as a nation we have a favourable balance of trade on the export and import of spirits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand the figures, so perhaps the Minister will explain. The increase in yield was £180 million. I thought that the yield increase would be £180 million over this year's total revenue, times 100 per cent. That was the figure that I was after. I thought that that would be slightly greater than inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If we take the figures together, the yield increase is an increase, as the hon. Gentleman says, of £180 million in a full year, against a total forecast of duty of something like £4.25 billion. If hon. Members will restrain themselves, I shall give them the explanations they require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the duty on spirits is way below the inflation level. I said that it was a 1.9 per cent increase. However, the increase on beer is 7.5 per cent. The total take shows that the biggest amount—nearly £2 billion

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we assume from the Minister's figures that the proposition that there should be a cut in beer consumption was built into the calculation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An assessment of the effect on consumption was built into the figures. Figures on record show that, over a quarter of a century, through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, we saw a steady increase in beer consumption. In 1980 it seemed to reach a plateau. Since then there has been a decline in beer consumption of just over 7 per cent. Time will tell whether that trend will continue, as there are different patterns of drink consumption. However, as the increase in beer duty is above mere valorisation, it will almost certainly have an effect on future consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be two reasons. Reduction in consumption could result from a change in taste or it could be tax-induced. Was the tax-induced reduction—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the question. The hon. Gentleman is normally much fairer than this and usually follows debate with much closer attention. I refer him to what I have said. The expert advisers have a good record in making estimations, especially in relation to alcohol and cigarettes. Account is taken of the elasticities that go with it—that is a curious phrase to apply to drinks. They make the best assessments they can, but we all know that at the end of the day other factors also influence the quantity and type of drinks consumed.

The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) read out his brief from the Scotch whisky industry with care. It was a pity that he wanted to add some political points by making an unfounded attack upon my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst). The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire appeared to be saying that, because the relative duty on spirits was so high, we should, over a period of time, be aligning everything with it. Presumably that would mean substantial increases in the charges and duties on beer, cider and other drinks that at present weigh down the level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting proposition is being put forward. I can see why it should be put forward in a whisky-producing area. However, a beer and cider-consuming area would expect a more balanced presentation and we have heard that more balanced view about the need for a reasonable equation between the various drinks in most speeches. The only hon. Member who seemed to plead specifically and partially for one section of the industry was the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained, beer produces the greatest amount of revenue and its duty has been increased by roughly one-and-a-half times the rise in the cost of living. That increase is in tune with nearly all the other increases where such duties are levied. It is only petrol,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
dery and spirits—the major excise duties—that have not been increased broadly one-and-a-half-times more than valorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to beer and employment prospects. Duty rises have contributed to the higher price of beer in real terms, which has affected sales adversely. However, it has also been mentioned that brewers have been increasing their prices. The price paid by the customer has often been significantly more than the rise resulting from the increased tax. I suspect that many customers think that the increase is just because of the tax and the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) made that point effectively from his experience in his part of the country. Changing consumer preferences are leading to significant alterations in the pattern of consumption across the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) referred to small breweries. During the past 12 months some small breweries have been in difficulties, particularly in the areas hit by the recession. The hon. Member for Workington mentioned that such breweries have often been vulnerable to takeovers. I do not know whether it is true in the example that the hon. Member for Workington gave, but often such breweries have not invested prudently and have been ill-equipped to cope with the continuing shift for consumer preference from ales and the draft beers of the past to lagers, which now seem to attract much greater attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brewery in my constituency produces lager, which is an expanding market. It was the subject of a multi-million-pound investment programme. The overall drop in demand for all beers throughout the British market led to the proposed rationalisation takeovers, and one reason for rationalisation is the increasing emphasis by the Government on raising duties, thereby endangering the distribution and expansion of the beer market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not sought to deny that the increase in duties will have had an effect on consumption. That is a matter for the record. In my part of the country rationalisation is taking place among the major breweries, and it often leads to the shutting down of small breweries. A small brewery producing goods of high quality attracts a clientele and a loyalty, and in recent years it is noticeable that some small breweries, particularly those with ready access to retail outlets, are thriving and extending their markets. Overall, however, there has been a decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to duty deferment. Although this issue has not figured largely in our debate, it affects people outside considerably. The spirits and wine trades have pressed for an extension of duty deferment from an average of four weeks to an average of six weeks, to help their financial position and to offset the effect of the withdrawal of the postponed accounting for VAT on imports and deliveries from warehouses. But their case is not all that good, particularly as they enjoy bonded facilities—an advantage that they have over many other people who bring goods into the country. It is estimated that extending duty deferment for all wines and spirits to an average of six weeks would cost the Exchequer about £75 million. That would be more than a third of the additional tax burden that consumers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
will pay as a result of the overall increases on alcohol in this Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of his speech, the hon. Member for Hodge Hill referred to health considerations. The matter was mentioned by many other hon. Members. The Government recognise the importance of health considerations and take it into account when considering changes in duty on alcohol. However, a systematic use of tax rates should not be seen as a method of regulating consumption. Successive Governments have taken that view. The Budget changes in drinks duties should not result in an overall increase in alcohol consumption, in spite of this increase a little beyond the inflation level. As I said earlier, it will almost certainly lead to an overall decline in consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if the Government took account of the health hazards of alcoholism in this Budget, they would not have left whisky and spirits at a lower level of increase than other drinks. Most medical people agree that spirits are much more harmful than beer or wines, and if there had been a serious consideration of health matters, the increase in duty on spirits would have been larger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will table a question on the matter I shall be happy to supply him with information to show the relative movements in the pattern of alcohol consumption over a significant number of years. I tell him from memory that there has been a decline in the consumption of beer and spirits. The sharp increase has been in wine consumption. The Chancellor reached his conclusion as the result of a balanced judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Max-ton) is quite right. If the Chancellor had been concerned only with health. no doubt he would have arrived at a different conclusion. If he had been concerned only with the export potential of the Scotch whisky industry, the pattern might have been different again. What he sought to do, however, was to achieve a reasonable balance between the many considerations involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stretford spoke of Irish whiskey as though it were an import. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I think the best Irish whiskey is made in the United Kingdom, especially in one particular part of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very interesting debate, possibly the longest that we have had on this clause. One of its most interesting aspects is that it will almost certainly be the starting point for next year's debate, because clause 1 is always about the tax on alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for giving such a full reply. I shall try to cover all the points that he made. I am afraid that I was not convinced by his explanation of how the Chancellor decided on the rate of increase on any particular drink. The Minister spoke of percentages, explaining, quite fairly, that 1 p on a pint of cider means one percentage and 2p or 3p on a pint of beer means another, whether it is calculated as a percentage of the existing taxes or as a percentage of the existing prices. That did not carry conviction. Those taxes are based not on pennies per pint, but on pennies per
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
hectolitre of alcohol or per litre with reference to degrees of gravity. I suspect that in any case the figures are rounded, and that the true figure is not exactly 1p per pint on cider and 2p per pint on beer, or any other specific number of pence on a bottle of wine or a bottle of whisky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it was a matter of balance, but I must remind him that this year according to the figures that we have been given, the Government are increasing the tax on wine by 8.3 per cent and the tax on beer by 7.5 per cent. If it were a question of balance, I would expect the percentages to be the same. Last year the Government reduced the tax on wine and increased the tax on beer as a result of threats and directives and rulings and warnings from the EEC. After last year's bias in favour of wine, it seems strange that this year's increase in the tax on wine is greater than the increase in the tax on beer. I cannot understand the logic. If it were a matter of balance, we would expect the Government to say either, "Last year we increased the tax by these different percentages to achieve a balance so that the ratio now stays the same", or "We did not do enough of it last year, and we want to take another bite this year." Either way, I would expect a higher increase on beer than on wine. The Government's present position seems inconsistent. I suspect that it was an ad hoc decision made off the top of their heads, I was not convinced by the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We got into difficulties with the Commission because the ratio between the two was wrong. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that these adjustments allow us to maintain the ratio of about three-to-one which he will remember from last year as a crucial figure. We shall not be accused again of infringing those judgments by imposing a higher rate of duty on wine than on beer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For reasons that I shall explain on a later clause, I am suspicious of this Government's arithmetic. The Minister says that the ratio is "about" 3:1. That means that it is anything from 2.5:1 to 3.5:1. But I shall not spend any more time on the point. If the Minister is sure that he is on firm ground, will he write to me at his leisure—I do not mean tomorrow—and give me the figures? Then my hon. Friends who serve on the Finance Bill Committee next year will be able to pursue the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to get the percentage total yield figure sorted out. I should have thought that the right way in which to proceed was to divide this year's yield increase of £180 million by last year's figure. That is surely how one arrives at this year's increase on last year's figure. The Minister's explanation of that certainly confused me, and I am still anxious to know the percentage increase on last year's yield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair to the Minister, he gave a number of statistics that may become clear to all of us when we look at Hansard. It is difficult to be absolutely clear when one listens to figures, and we can always return to the matter on Report or next year, depending on what we conclude when we have examined the Minister's words in black and white.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me refer to import-export considerations—a matter that the Minister said had been taken into account
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
by the Chancellor. Some of my hon. Friends said that one could not separate whisky from the other spirits. Although I have much sympathy with the whisky industry—I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood)—our problem is that we are now members of the European Economic Community, which will not let us discriminate in favour of whisky as against other spirits, which may be imported. Twenty-two per cent of spirits are imported and we are not allowed to discriminate against them or against wine because of EEC rulings. We all know where the Liberal party stands on that—but I shall not pursue the point further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall press the Minister on the matter. He says that only 22 per cent of spirits are imported— and therefore that 78 per cent are produced in Britain. There may still be import considerations. I understand that one of our growth drinks is a rum-based drink. Apparently many people have been switching to drinks such as Malibu or Pina Colada. I am not sure whether the rum used is imported, or produced in this country. If it is produced in this country, it is produced from imported materials because as we all know, it is based on molasses. Even if a drink is produced here, there may still be import considerations. For example, British sherry does not come from British vineyards; it is based on materials imported from other countries. It is called British sherry because it is a made wine; alcohol is put into it to produce a so-called sherry. I shall leave that point, but there are import considerations that the Minister did not seem to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Minister was equally unconvincing on the health argument. He suggested that he had recognised the importance of the health aspect but then said that taxation was not an appropriate way in which to deal with health considerations. When we come to clause 2 which covers tobacco, we shall hear a different story. I shall have some sympathy with the Minister on that, but we ought to be consistent. More important, I shuddered when I heard the Minister suggest—my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Max-ton) put his finger right on this point—that spirits were healthier than wine. That does not accord with my belief or, I suspect, with that of many doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the increase on all the products—with the exceptions of spirits at one end of the scale and cider at the other— was equivalent to about one and a half times the rate of inflation. Why? Because this Government's policy is to transfer the burden from direct to indirect taxation. The Minister then said that of course the Government took account of the changing pattern of consumption—of consumers' changing preferences and of the relative elasticities—as if people sit down and decide what drink to buy according to the amount of tax on it. I can tell him why beer consumption is falling and wine consumption is rising: it is the beer drinkers who are unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make what is little more than an intervention? The schedule deals with the specific details of the duties, as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wine or made-wine of a strength of less than 15 per cent and not being sparkling"</p></blockquote>
goes up by 8.29 per cent; the same figure applies to sparkling wine. For
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wine or made-wine of a strength of not less than 15 per but not exceeding 18 per cent"</p></blockquote>
the increase is 7.3 per cent, and of more than 18 per cent, the increase is even less, 6.3 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures contain what the Minister calls a "judgment". Will the Minister say, for the benefit not only of the Committee but of the country at large, how such judgments are made and whether a consistent thread runs from one year to the next? The Minister said that the Common Market had told us that we taxed wine too highly, and I understand that the main complaint from the French, at least, was over still table wine, for which the tax increase is 8.29 per cent—a greater increase than that for vermouths and ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the increase 8.29 per cent for still table wines, and as little as 6.3 per cent for vermouths and ports? What was the basis for that judgment? I understood the Minister to say that was partly on health grounds, so that any increase should not increase consumption. The take, or income, to be brought in by the three percentage increases must have also been considered. Was there any other deciding factor? If there was not, what weight did he give to the first two considerations? Was it 66 per cent to the health consideration and only 33 per cent to the take, or did the Minister wake up one morning and say, "I know what I will do; I will do it this way"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am mystified. It is also important for the country, and for importers, exporters and manufacturers to know what goes on in the Minister's—or the Treasury's—mind when the decisions are being made. Will he enlighten the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I am entirely with the Minister on clause 2. I agree with increasing the duty on cigarettes over and above the rate of inflation. I may have been neutral on clause 1, but I want to support clause 2 and see it stand part of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friends will share my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a smoker, and I hope that there are not too many smokers among Opposition members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not be in favour of a swingeing increase on the price of cigarettes in any one year. That would have an adverse effect on tobacco manufacturers and retailers. I am sure that all members of the Committee have received representations on that, some of which are valid and others not. No Government should make swingeing changes in duties or impositions on any one section of society without warning, but that is what happens when the Budget statement is made. That is not the right way to govern the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past two years, the Chancellor has said that he proposed to increase the tax on tobacco by more than inflation. This time the tax is not much more than inflation—the increase is about 6p on a packet of 20 cigarettes, or 7.9 per cent. Inflation is now about 6 per cent, and I think that an increase of about 9 per cent or 10 per cent would be more apposite. However, I am grateful for small mercies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike alcohol, which we dealt with in clause 1, there is no dispute about smoking cigarettes being harmful to health. It causes the National Health Service great expense. If the Government are considering making the Health Service more efficient and spending less money on it, one way is to get people to smoke less. The increase in the tax on tobacco should have been more than 7.9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sceptical about the Chancellor's reasons. If the Chancellor genuinely wants to deter people from smoking cigarettes, he should not put only 6p on a packet of 20 cigarettes and do nothing else. That smacks of insincerity. I do not accuse him of being insincere, but his action could be interpreted as such. If he genuinely wanted people not to smoke, he could do something about advertising cigarettes and associated products on hoardings, in football stadia and in cinemas. I hope that the Minister will take that point on board and give us his views. Such advertising could be stopped; there is no need for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor should also stop the advertising of cigars and associated paraphernalia on television. Cigarettes are not advertised on television, but cigarette companies have clever ways of getting across on television what they sell. It is interesting to note that, although the Chancellor says that he wants to deter people from smoking, he goes only as far as raising the tax on cigarettes. One or two Ministers have been courageous in their attacks on smoking, but they have not had the support of other Ministers. Any attempts that have been made have foundered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Chancellor says next year—as I hope he will—that yet again he will increase the tax on cigarettes by more than inflation, I hope that it will be done in conjunction with other measures so that people have a real incentive to stop smoking. That would help the medical profession, which wants preventative medicine.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
It does not want tens of thousands of people to die in hospitals of lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes. No one wants that. It is an established fact that people who smoke cigarettes increase their chances of dying of lung cancer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a different problem from alcohol, which we dealt with in clause 1. Alcoholism brings problems, but drinking in moderation is all right. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) apparently does not agree. Perhaps we can take up that argument another day. As I understand it, a small amount of alcohol does no harm to anyone and does not cause ill health. There are temptations. Drinking a lot of alcohol causes problems. I clearly distinguish between the products in clause 1 and those in clause 2. I have no doubt that cigarettes, cigars, tobacco and so on are detrimental to health. Sooner or later, a Government must go all the way to deter people from smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look at the example set by London Transport. I am glad that the unelected quango that took over from that elected body still bans smoking on underground trains and is widening that example by trying to ban smoking on stations. It is time that the Government urged British Rail to have non-smoking in every rail carriage and not merely in three quarters of them. The Government could do that. It would earn them credit and would do more than anything else to put the Chancellor of the Exchequer's measures in the clause into their true perspective, as I see it, of stopping people smoking cigarettes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another side to the coin. Many people are employed in the tobacco industry. They could become unemployed. What do we do about that? A clear statement of policy would be needed by the Government, which I think would meet with all-party support, whereby there could be consensus between the present Government and any future Government that it was Government policy to deter people from smoking, that the cost of cigarettes would increase over and above the rate of inflation, and that this and succeeding Governments would do their best to curtail smoking by banning advertising and by ensuring that people did not smoke in public places. If the Government made such a statement, I think that there would be a welcome for it from the Opposition. Moreover, it would show the tobacco companies that they must diversify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister said—I agree with her, although I do not often do so that it was incumbent on companies not to rely upon only one product but to diversify. Conservative Members often remind us that we live in a changing world and that markets must be respected. The companies which at present make tobacco products would know that they had to speed up their diversification so that, as markets changed, there would be no hiatus with many people suddenly becoming unemployed because of a large decrease in tobacco smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the argument is that the process must be carried out slowly and that the Government directive must be clear for more than the lifetime of one Government. The Government have it in their power to act. I hope that they grasp the nettle so that I may look forward in five or ten years to smoking being limited to private rooms because most people are ashamed to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in the city of Glasgow a target was set for having a smoke-free city by the year 2000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware of that. I am glad to hear of it. I offer my support, meagre though it may be, to my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is a big one. However, the Government and the Opposition could join forces to give leadership to the nation on the habit of smoking, which causes death, unnecessary expense to the Health Service and which as Members of Parliament we should do something about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to answering the detailed points raised by my hon. Friends, will the Minister make it clear what the Government's purpose is on tobacco taxation? He will recall that in last year's Budget statement, the Chancellor made deliberate reference to the representations of those involved in the NHS, without specifying that that had influenced his raising the tax by 10p on a packet of cigarettes. He gave the House to understand that he was influenced and pressured by those health representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that, when pressed in Committee last year, he would not say whether it was deliberate Government policy to deter people from smoking by raising taxation. He would not distinguish between the Government's tax policy of raising revenue and their social policy of deterring smoking. This year, will he make a clear statement? Is it part of the Government's policy to deter smoking by raising tax and to have a social arm to that policy? Will he give us the figures of the impact of smoking? Last year, figures were thrown around the Committee about the number of premature deaths from lung-related diseases. The DHSS figure was 50,000; Dr. Wald, of Oxford university, suggested that it was nearer 95,000. The Minister did not give us an answer then, but I hope that he will tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that he will give the Committee the figures about which he was asked and on which organisations such as ASH have constantly pressed the Government. What is the cost to the country of lung-related diseases? What is the cost to the NHS of providing important and valuable health care facilities such as hospital beds, trained doctors and nurses and research? What is the cost to industry of lost hours at work because of ill-health caused by lung-related diseases? The Committee requires to know those figures. The House and, indeed, the country will benefit from a clear statement by the Government of the economic costs of smoking and how those relate to taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Government clarify the matter, there will always be a shadow of doubt in people's minds that they are not prepared to pursue the health grounds against smoking because they are keen and anxious not to lose the tax benefits which now run at more than £4 billion a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister try to address himself to those problems and face the undoubtedly difficult balance that he must draw between the desire to raise revenue and the desire to pursue a socially conscious health policy which I believe crosses party lines and is a matter that all hon. Members must support and endorse? The

Committee will be much in the Minister's debt if he would clarify the position tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that we have had such a short debate on the clause, because it is important. I beleive that all Members of Parliament have received a letter from a campaign called "Play Fair on Tobacco Taxation". It represents people who sell tobacco, such as retail tobacconists, newsagents and so on and wrote to every Member of Parliament to express its views before the Budget statement. It placed an advertisement in 	<i>The House Magazine</i> to thank some Members of Parliament for having listened to its case for fair taxation on tobacco. I am surprised that we have not heard from some Conservative Members, as they are mentioned in the advertisement and thanked for listening to the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped to hear from the hon. Members for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern), for Corby (Mr. Powell) and for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark). The hon. Member for Croydon, South is the chairman of the Conservative Back Bench committee, but he has not been asked to serve on this Committee for some reason. In my list, I had meant to mention the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. We know why he is unable to contribute to the debate. I had also hoped to hear from the hon. Members for Luton, South (Mr. Bright), for St. Albans (Mr. Lilley), and for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). They were all thanked publicly for listening to the case put forward by the campaign. That does not mean that they accepted its argument. Nonetheless, I should have thought that, like my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), they not only listened to the argument but came to different conclusions from that desired by the campaign. I only wish that we had been able to hear the views of Conservative Members, but no doubt the pressures of time are such that they will reserve their comments for a later date. However, I assure the Minister that I do not intend to advise my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the comments made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). The Chancellor's proposals on tobacco taxation were welcomed in the House. He carried on the process, though not at such a sharp rate, which he had adopted last year by increasing more than valorisation the duty on cigarettes and tobacco used for rolling. As he did last year, the Chancellor also took into account the representations made on health grounds. I am not tempted to discuss matters way beyond my own or the Treasury's responsibility, such as the DHSS's concern over advertising. The Treasury is not responsible for that, except for changing the VAT charged on advertisements in magazines and newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am much more concerned about clause 2, which will increase taxation by £170 million in 1985-86 and by £180 million in a full year. That is roughly the same amount as that raised under clause 1. Yet the RPI effect of the changes brought about by clause 2 will be roughly doubled. Such is the magic of statistics and figures about which we commented before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor also took into account representations made about employment on behalf of those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
areas of the country in which pipe tobacco and cigars were made. He also considered that it was older people with lower incomes who tended to use pipe tobacco. The Chancellor also considered the pattern of the consumption of cigars. It is wrongly believed that the majority of cigar smokers belong to the social groups A or B. I am advised that whiffs and smaller cigars account for 85 per cent of the total expenditure on cigars and that 56 per cent of cigar smokers are in the C, D and E social groups. That is unexpected. I always thought that cigar smoking was a habit of the bloated rich. Statistics show that that is not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps people have switched from cigarettes to cigars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, but possibly on spurious grounds of health or taste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not on this occasion. The Government are not animated solely by one particular consideration, which, perhaps, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) would like. My impression is that some of his hon. Friends would like that. The Government are trying to maintain a balance in the many considerations that apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it may be on spurious grounds that people have switched from cigarettes to cigars. He used the word "spurious". But the Budget encouraged the cigarette smoker to switch to small cigars because the price of one has gone up more than the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are trying to have it all ways. They argue the employment case when it suits them—[Interruption.]—Oh, yes. With great respect, delegations came to me at the Treasury, led by Oppostion Members—not necessarily those in the Committee—and backed by all-party group, to argue the employment case. The Government have reached a balanced judgment on the issue which is broadly acceptable in the country. I believe that some of the comments from Opposition Members do not reflect what their colleagues said when they were, quite properly, arguing a specific employment case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot judge the issue on one consideration or another; they have to reach a balance of judgement. On the issue of tobacco taxation, the Government have got it right this year. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am really surprised by what the Minister said. The civil servants have obviously given him a rotten brief, because it does not bear upon what took place. There were only a couple of speakers in the debate, and we made the point about employment and that tobacco companies should diversify. I cannot understand why the Minister should attack us or try to reply to the debate by saying that we did not understand that point. Of course we understood the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point about cigars being smoked by C and Ds rather than A and Bs was also spurious, because I do not believe that Opposition Members have mentioned that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, the Minister should reply to the debate because—[Interruption.]—When the Minister replied to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
the debate, it was not meaningful. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) made a valid point which received no reply. I also made the valid point that if one increased the price of cigarettes above inflation, it should be because of a comprehensive scheme, and that did not receive a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on future clauses, if not on this one, we get meaningful replies to our statements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendement No. 2 in, page 2, line 37, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 39, leave out "35"' and insert —20"'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This subsection deals with six-months licences. it is possible for someone to get a licence for a car for six months instead of paying a full year's tax at one go. At present, there is a compulsion on the Government to provide six-month licences if the cost of an annual licence exceeds £18. This subsection will increase that threshold form £18 to 05. That is a very big increase in one step, and Opposition Members would like the Minister to explain the thinking behind that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the subsection or some similar provision does not take effect, the Government will be put into the position of having to introduce six-month licences for a group of vehicles for which six-month licences are not now available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to increase the tax on the largest capacity motor cycles from £18 to £20. According to the present law, a six-month licence must be made available if the annual tax exceeds £18. It follows that there are no six-month licences at present for motorcycles. If the tax on large motor-cycles is to be increased, the Government must raise that threshold, otherwise they will have to make available for the first time six-month licences for the largest motor cycle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave the matter there, because I hope to get an explanation from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport which convinces me either to withdraw both of my amendments or to press one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Michael Spicer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first thank the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) for his earlier, welcoming remarks on my small guest appearance. I am, as he said, here merely to assist the Committee on the minor technical clauses which are concerned with transport and to which the two amendments relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Burnley (Mr. Pike), I have just spent 34 sittings on the Committee considering the Transport Bill and therefore, like them I am presumably something of an addict for Committees, particularly the Finance Committee. I have spent no less than four sittings of the Finance Committee discussing at great length, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
merits of Perrier against cider or beer and I came to much the same conclusions that hon. Members have reached tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection of clause 4, to which the amendments relate, merely increases—in line with the rate of inflation it was last increased in 1977—the threshold above which the Secretary of State has to make, six monthly licences available in addition to the annual ones. This threshold has in the past been increased in line with inflation. In fact that is all that the clause is doing on this occasion although the threshold has not been raised since 1977, which, I suspect, partly explains the big jump.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were we not to make this adjustment and to make it a much smaller jump, medium-sized motorcycles would be eligible for the six-monthly licences. We have had no representations from the trade to indicate that that concession would be important to it and I have to say, therefore, that we certainly think it right that that category of motorcycle should not be included within the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis, therefore, that we wish to continue to keep out that category and on the basis that all that we are doing is raising the threshold in line with the rate of inflation—it would be a waste of this Committee's time to do so each year—we think that this is the right level and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's very gentle correction. I was wrong in saying that no motorcycles qualify for a six-month licence. The largest motorcycles—those over 250cc—have six-month licences and will continue to have them if the amendment is agreed. It is the medium-sized motorcycles which are on the verge or going over the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not bothered to check the details of the calculation, but I accept what the Minister says, namely that the increase is in line with the rate of inflation since 1977. I am still a little puzzled about why it does not happen more frequently than every eight years. I suspect that what has sparked it off this year has been the fact that the increase in duty on the medium range of motorcycles takes us off the threshold. Why, then, put it up to £35? That seems to leave a great deal of leeway for the Government. They do not discuss the issue of six months licences if they increase the tax on motorcycles by more than the rate of inflation in future years. After all, this year the Government are increasing the tax on motorcycles by more than the rate of inflation, as I shall explain in the debates on subsequent amendments. I am not persuaded that we should simply allow the Government a big increase from £18 to £35 and unless the Minister, or one of his hon. Friends, can persuade me we shall want to press the issue to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 1, leave out subsections (5) and (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (4) and (6) deal with trade licence arrangements made by dealers to cover vehicles they are selling. The subsections increase the charge from £44 to £46 for trade licences for cars—an increase of 5 per cent. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why we are being asked to increase the charge, how the Government decide the amount of increase, and why they have increased trade licences for cars but not for motor-bikes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be as persuasive with the hon. Gentleman on this amendment as on the previous amendment. The main point in answer to his reasonable queries is that the Government see no reason why this favourable concession, and this modest increase, which has been given to motor traders whereby they will pay the new amount of £46 for trade licences a concession which they welcome and for which we have had only favourable comments for obvious reasons should not be granted. Other people have come forward asking for similar concessions, but I will not pursue that now, although there is a case for similar concessions and concession it certainly is—for other people. In terms of equity alone, a case is made. I am getting an answer via motor-bike, which I am relieved has arrived at an appropriate moment. The figure of £9 for motor-bikes is too low. The principle of revaluation remains. Motor-bikes have been rounded down to the same figure as before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The increase on cars is 5 per cent. An increase of 5 per cent on £9 would be 45p. We would expect that to be rounded up to £9.50. But there was an increase of 50p last year. Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has one on me there. However, 45p is less than 50p and we are talking of very small sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reflection, the Committee will no doubt accept that we are making a concession which the trade welcomes and that the increases are in line with, and indeed below many other, VED increases, and we see no reason why the beneficiaries should get further benefits by falling behind because of the overall rise in VED rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The general increase in indirect taxation in this clause is one-and-a-half times the rate of inflation, and we heard that from the Minister of State, in an earlier debate. One-and-a-half times the rate of inflation would be about 7.5 per cent, which was the increase imposed on a wide range of drinks and, I believe, on tobacco. I wish to know why this is an increase of 5 per cent rather than 7.5 per cent, rounded though it may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a different point and I think that the hon. Gentleman is being very fly. As I understood him, he was arguing for a lower rate of increase. Now that I have said that this is a rather modest increase, he is coming back to me, certainly ingenuously and perhaps even reasonably, and asking why we had not made it more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asking not why the Government had not made it more but why the increase was 5 per cent. Perhaps I should explain my question in more detail. We are probing the Minister on this issue and trying to get him to tell us why he chose 5 per cent as the rate of increase on this charge, whereas the rates are different on other charges and, indeed, on other vehicle excise duties. It seems to be totally anomalous. The Minister said that it was not imposed on motorbikes because that would involve a small amount of money, but the same Government increased the charge for traders' licences for motor-cycles by that much last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It all seems to be a mishmash impossible to understand. There seems to be no logic in the Government's policy, and that is why I am pressing the Minister to tell us what the logic is behind saying that the increase in traders' licences for cars will be £2, so that it rises from £44 to £46, that there will be no increase on motorcycles, and how that compares with the Government's policy, which, after all, should be consistent with last year's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To achieve that consistency, one must compare this VED increase with other VED increases. That is the logical comparison. When we come to discuss some of the other VED increases, we see that they all have their reasons and I or my hon. Friend will be pleased to disucss the rationale behind them. They have to do with track costs. There is a theme running through the VED increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of trade licences we have said that it would be logical to increase the charge according to the rate of inflation, and that is what we have done. In the case of other VED increases we are much more concerned with track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was perfectly fair for the hon. Gentleman to press me to establish a logic. This increase is within and linked to the rate of inflation, and when we come to other VED issues we shall not necessarily be discussing fitting them into any particular fiscal strategy. What we are concerned about in this instance and in other VED matters is some relationship to the wear and tear that such vehicles impose on the roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have come to the conclusion that there is no logic behind the increase. However, I shall defer further comment until we come to later amendments, when no doubt we shall be told why the increase should be higher for other vehicle licences than for trade vehicle licences.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments relates to the rate of vehicle excise duty on motorcycles and cars. There are three rates of VED for motorcycles, depending on cubic capacity. At present, the figure is £9 for a machine under 150cc, £18 between 150cc and 250cc and 06 for a motor cycle over 250cc. A motor car or light van carries VED of £90. The Government will increase all those duties by 11 per cent. I am anxious to establish the rationale behind that figure. I note that the Minister of State is replacing—or perhaps coming to the rescue of —his hon Friend the Parly Under-Secretary of State for Transport. No doubt he will explain why the increase is 11 per cent for motorcycles, cars and light vans while that for other vehicles tends to be less. Of course, the increase will be higher on very heavy goods vehicles; perhaps we shall come to that in the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase of 11 per cent is twice the rate of inflation. We see it as a tax that penalises motorists who drive short distances typically, those who use their cars to go to work, and perhaps have a trip out with the family at weekends. Again, some people have to use a car to take their children to school, which in rural areas may be several miles away. In such circumstances it is essential to use a car, often as there is no alternative transport. We strongly oppose this increase in tax on owners of motorbikes or cars, especially as it represents twice the rate of inflation. We are talking about a massive increase in VED; I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why it is felt necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask a simple question. What will happend in the longer term about the Sinclair electric vehicle? As I understand it, the manufacturer claims that it is capable of all sorts of vehicular antics but that has been challenged by trading standards officers. I note that the Minister is rushing through his brief, trying to find a section headed "Electrical vehicles manufactured by Sinclair". We are entitled for an explanation, in view of the court case in which someone was accused of being drunk in charge of such a vehicle in Whitehall—perhaps he was driving past Downing street at the time!—and the fact that the Sinclair electric car has tyres and an engine, which admittedly is not an internal combustion engine, and uses the roadway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 p.m</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we are dealing with a specific detailed amendment, perhaps it would be helpful if I made a more general comment about the clause and about the increases in vehicle excise duty. As the hon. Gentleman said they represent double inflation, broadly if one takes the average of all the vehicles concerned. I gather that the average on rates comes out to 10 per cent, but when that is combined with the growth in the number of vehicles, it will yield an increase in revenue in a full year of about 11.912 per cent. For most vehicles, the increase in VED was the figure given by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), 11.1 per cent. The key figure was the increase from £90 to £100 for the general VED which applies to cars and vans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
Earlier I referred to one-and-a-half times valorisation being the broad general pattern over a range of taxes. That is true here if we consider both the petrol and dery being increased strictly by price terms, which we discussed on clause 3 in Committee on the Floor of the House. If we average it out and say that the increase in petrol or dery is roughly valorisation, with roughly double valorisation for the vehicle duty, it gives a figure about one-and-a-half times for the average motorist. I shall not be precise about the figures, though I shall give the hon. Gentleman precise figures if he will specify the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that an increase in VED must bear more heavily on the motorist who is driving a few miles. In the past when the petrol duty was increased more than prices and more than the relative increase in the vehicle duty, it was a disincentive to the high mileage user. In this Budget the Chancellor thought that the increases in VED from £90 to £100 were justified bearing in mind that he would not make an increase in petrol duty beyond strict valorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman properly said, there is a range of increases in relation to vehicles, depending on the size of the vehicle. The range runs from low figure up to close to 30 per cent in specific cases which will be looked at in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 would limit the increase in the annual rate on VED on motor-cycles with an engine size up to 150cc to 50p instead of £1. That would be a 5.6 per cent increase instead of an 11.1 per cent increase. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would similarly limit the increases for the larger motor cycles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 would limit the increase for light vans, although not for cars. I imagine that that is a drafting matter. Cars are excluded and this group of amendments does not deal with them. I advise the Committee to resist the amendments, particularly as cars will remain at 11.1 per cent. It would be absurd to make such changes and take vehicles out of line with the pattern that has been established on the key vehicle—the car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a drafting error. My remarks showed clearly that we intended to put motorcycles, light vans and cars on the same basis with an increase of about 5 per cent rather than 11 per cent. I hope that the Minister will not use that error as a reason for opposing the amendments. We can pass them and then tidy up on Report the drafting on cars to give effect to the Committee's wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hahoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not making a great point. I would resist such a change on cars, which would involve more substantial sums with a considerable effect. I do not have the detailed figure for cars, only for the amendments as they legalistically arise. The sums involved in the amendments are relatively small, but the hon. Gentleman will realise that altering the change for vehicle excise duty would result in a much more substantial figure. The judgment of the Budget as a whole, taking account of the fact that in the House of Commons petrol and dery were left in the valorised state, was to see things in the round and seek a broad increase of one-and-a-half times valorisation, which this increase produces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has accepted that the purpose of our amendments is to deal with motorcycles, light vans and cars. He has admitted that the Government's measure will penalise the motorist who has a low yearly mileage or who drives a small car and uses proportionately less petrol. For him the fixed cost of vehicle excise duty is a more significant part of his motoring costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter seems to me to be one of redistribution. I should be more sympathetic if the Minister had turned the argument round 180 degrees. If we were being asked to approve increases in taxes so that the motorist driving the biggest car paid more tax and the person driving the smallest car paid proportionately less I should be more sympathetic. However, I am afraid that that is the difference between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe that we are elected to represent people who drive small cars and who cover less mileage. Those motorists are being taxed exceptionally by the Government. The argument is not that about wear and tear trailed by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary. His argument will apply later when we come to heavy goods vehicles. It is interesting that different Ministers put forward different arguments. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Transport says that the Government will increase the charge for trailers only by the rate of inflation. The Minister of State, Treasury, takes a more greedy attitude to taxes, although I do not intend that remark personally. He says that the figure must be 11 per cent—twice the amount for the private motorist.

I am sure that I have carried my hon. Friends with me and I hope that I have also persuaded the representative of the Liberal party, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). He was nodding as I spoke, so I look forward to his support. We shall press the amendment to a Division. We shall vote on only the first amendment but I wish it to be clearly understood that we are voting on the whole group—motorcycles of all types, light vans and motor cars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 90, line 5, leave out "50.00" and insert "47.50".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 9. in page 90, line 6, leave out "1.00" and insert "0.50".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments affect taxis, coaches and buses. The tax arrangements are somewhat complicated. There is a basic tax—at present, it is £45—which applies to taxis, coaches and buses, and the Government propose to increase that tax to £50—an increase of £5, representing an increase of 11.1 per cent for taxis, coaches and buses. However, there is an additional charge for coaches and buses, because at present if more than 20 passengers are carried there is an extra 90p for each extra person. The Government propose to increase that from 90p to £1—a further increase of 11.1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments seek to increase the basic tax—the only tax paid by taxis—by 5 per cent to £47.50. For buses and coaches the effect would be different, because we propose that the extra tax paid for every seat on a coach or bus should be 50p, instead of the present 90p or the Government's proposed £1. In other words, in this complicated formula we are proposing a lower rate of tax per seat on coaches and buses than exists at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coaches are usually defined as vehicles with 53 seats, which means that the supplement is charged 33 times—the supplement being on every seat over 20 seats. The amendment would reduce the tax on coaches from £74.70 to £64. The Government want to increase it to £83. The present tax on a bus is £83; the Government want to increase it to £102; we are proposing amendment which would reduce it to £73.50. That is deliberate—we want to reduce levels of taxation on public transport, by which I mean coaches and buses. We would increase the tax on taxis, but it would be a tax of 5 per cent, in line with what we propose for motorcycles, cars and light vans. We still consider that to be a reasonable increase. We do not oppose all increases on motorcycles, cars and light vans. We say that such increases should be in line with inflation. We are willing to support the Government if they ask for a 5 per cent increase. It may be unpopular, but we accept that other Governments would behave in the same way. We are not simply engaging in a populist exercise and opposing any increase in the taxation of those vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we do believe that there is a strong case for reducing the fixed cost of running a coach or bus by this small amount as a gesture towards the increasing costs of public transport, particularly in the climate being created by other Government Bills. But we shall not discuss them at this late hour and would not do so even if the rules or order allowed us to. I do not expect the Minister to accept our proposals. I do, however, expect him to explain why he wishes to increase the taxes on taxis, coaches and buses by 11 per cent rather than keeping the increase in line with inflation. I do not think that it is enough simply to say that it will be in line with the tax on motorbikes. Why did the Government choose 11 per cent for those vehicles, as opposed to the increase—some lower, others higher—for other vehicles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) was right, as ever, in thinking that I would advise the Committee to resist his amendments. I consider it appropriate for increases for both taxis and coaches to move up by the same percentage as those on the generality of other vehicles. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's reasoning, but it can also be fairly argued that coaches and buses alone among vehicles at present are not meeting the full costs that they impose on the roads. When their VED is combined with the cost of fuel, unlike all other classes of road user—particularly following the changes in the Budget—they would not be required to meet the full running costs. Under our proposals, however, they would be moving in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interesed in the Minister's definition of "the full cost". Will he explain what is meant by it, and how far it will include environmental factors and the ability to plan the inner city and housing development? Will such factors be covered in the Treasury calculation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a more limited calculation. It is the one which will be recognised, and has been used, by the Department of Transport, and studied by Select Committees. It is not some definition that I am producing out of the air. It is reasonably established, and if I may I will stick to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to get involved in a general environmental argument. I am dealing specifically with the point that coaches and buses alone among vehicles are not meeting their full road running costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that the tax is used to maintain roads. Surely no one still believes the myth that vehicle excise duty is a tax upon a vehicle in relation to its road usage and that the money is therefore spent on maintaining the roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is grossly distorting what I am saying. I am not retreating to the argument about hypothecated expenditure or saying that the tax on vehicles must be equated with their road costs. The hon. Gentleman is old enough and wise enough to know that he should not seek to misrepresent me on such an issue or think that he will get away with it if he does. The position is clear. The majority of drivers—certainly of the private vehicles on the roads—are paying way above their track costs in VED and vehicle charges. Indeed, that is why the motoring organisations are being critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, is is right and proper that heavier vehicles, which do more damage to the roads, should at least meet their road track costs. That is what is proposed. The hon. Gentleman says that he and his hon. Friends judge that buses and coaches ought to be excepted. That is not a disreputable argument. It is not an argument with which I agree but I can understand why the hon. Gentleman might wish to push the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxis, already meet their track costs. That is a separate argument. However, as the hon. Gentleman knows, they already get a preferential rate of duty. If, as a result of the amendment, taxis were given a slightly better differential rate of duty compared with the private car, people could license their vehicle as a taxi
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
without properly using it as such, and thus avoid their proper revenue payments. I gather that a fuel duty rebate can also apply in certain circumstances. As the hon. Member for Hodge Hill said at the outset, it is a complicated matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear difference between the two sides of the Committee on coaches and buses. We believe that the increase should take place so that such vehicles come closer to meeting their full track costs, whereas Opposition Members for social and perhaps economic reasons—believe that it should not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene because our amendment seemed sane, sensible, reasonable and moderate. We have been responsible in going for just under half the Government's proposed increase, thus alleviating the burden and making a bow in the direction of the importance of public transport while allowing the Government an increase in line with inflation. That seemed to me so sensible that I thought the Minister would realise the error of his ways and accept the amendment. However, all that he has done is to read out a prepared brief. He has made no concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no logic in the Minister's remarks. He said that coaches and buses were not paying their full costs. But the Bill would not make them pay the full costs; it would merely move them slightly in that direction, and the anomaly that he claims justifies the increase ahead of inflation would remain. Therefore, why do not the Government go for the lower increase that we propose, especially as the Minister seeks to justify the increase with an entirely different argument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not grappled with the esscnce of our argument which is that public transport—particularly buses, but it applies to coaches over longer distances—offers a social service and has social advantages. Buses and coaches alleviate traffic pressure on roads; they stop pollution generated by people driving private cars, and they cut the social costs that arise from massive increases in car ownership and car use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that buses and coaches are are not bearing their full costs, but we think that they deserve the form of subsidy that comes from the lower rate of increase. It is particularly important that we give them a lower rate of increase than the Minister proposes at this time, when another Government Department is creating heavy burdens, and posing problems, for public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "Minister for bright ideas and funny thoughts" is proposing a procedure for deregulating transport which will put public transport into a disastrous state of intense competition that will end cross-subsidy, allow private operators to skim off the cream on the more profitable routes and thus prevent operators with a number of routes to cross-subsidise in the way they now do and to provide a social service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public transport is a form of social service which, in any advanced community, is essential for those who cannot afford cars, for those families whose one car is being used by the husband and where the children must get to school, and for all those categories of person who cannot be expected to use private transport. When a Government Department is hitting public transport through deregulation, we might have expected that the Treasury would not pick the same time to impose an increase of this size—double the rate of inflation.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
The Opposition are speaking as the protectors, defenders and advocates of public transport. The Minister should have paid some attention to that argument in what was his contemptuous dismissal to the reasonable and sensible proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, did not intend to speak in the debate, but the Minister's response has provoked me. I shall be relatively brief, although the amendment is worthy of a lengthy debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) referred to the difficult year ahead for public transport in the light of the Transport Bill now going through the House. Has he considered that the Government may intend to make difficulties for public transport greater in the coming year, and then, next year, to make things a little easier just before reorganisation takes place in October 1986? My mind may be a little devious, but I have seen the Secretary of State for Transport, and his Ministers, at work, and I recognise the disaster that the Bill presents to public transport. The public sees that it will be a disaster, and no doubt the Treasury does too, and is trying to give its colleagues in the Department of Transport a helping hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's argument—though interesting—presupposes a greater degree of consultation between Departments than in fact exists under this Government. It is well known that the Treasury speaks to most Departments and therefore would be able to coordinate such a strategy, but, unfortunately, the Secretary of State for Transport speaks only to God.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend has made a relevant point. As I come from Battersea to the House of Commons every morning, I pass the Ridley evangelical hall and think that the Secretary of State should visit it and see the light and recognise the disaster of his ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment is reasonable and should be accepted. I do not accept that the tax should be increased because public transport vehicle, do not meet the cost of their share of the roads. He failed to give the cost or how it was arrived at, yet the cost to the nation of carrying 72 passengers on a 72-seater bus makes greater economic sense than providing roads and parking spaces for 72 cars carrying 72 single passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could put forward more arguments in support of the amendment, but I do not wish to prolong the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is still as fluent and inaccurate as he was in the 34 sittings of the Transport Bill Committee. He is skating over the ground here as much as he did in that Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has completely missed the point. The country spends £1 billion a year on the bus industry in one form or another. When he compares buses with other forms of private transportation he should take acount of the massive fuel duty rebate that is given to large chunks of the bus industry and, when the Transport Bill comes into force, to registered taxis. The hon. Gentleman distorts the picture in a way that is not worthy even of him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the £1 billion given to public transport revenue, or capital, or a mixture of both?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is largely revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary tries to mislead this Committee as much as he did the Transport Committee. He is an apostle of the Secretary of State. Ministers on the Transport Committee spoke repeatedly of the support given to various areas of public transport. If this burden is added to a loss-making service at the end of the day that burden will have to be met from public funds somewhere, so it is simply transferred from one heading to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should accept an amendment that will give public transport a fairer crack of the whip and enable it to run at some saving to the transport undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austen Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provocative points put by the Under-Secretary in his HMV role in the Committee merit a stronger reply. My hon. Friend is being modest in his argument. The Minister said that the subsidy was £1 billion a year. That may be stretching the figures a little, but what is wrong with a subsidy on that scale when it helps the old, the poor, the school children and those who have no mobility and keeps down the use of the private car? When social gains are associated with that subsidy the question is why is the subsidy not bigger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), makes. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and I attended more than 30 sittings of the Transport Bill Committee and we began to understand the philosophy of Conservative Members. I shall give an example of the sort of support that Conservative Members believe should be given to public transport. One hon. Gentleman said that the first duty of public transport should be to run a service for the healthy and those who are able to pay and, having done that, then look at the requirements of the elderly and the disabled. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham will no doubt confirm that such wording was used. I accept that we should be calling for greater subsidies for public transport. I have no shame when money is spent on providing an essential service, especially when it is for the young, the elderly and the disabled and also for those members of a family who do not have the use of the family car while the driver is using it for work and so on. People depend on the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money should be available for public transport. This modest amendment is a tiny move towards giving public transport a helping hand to maintain the essential services which are so vital to so many sectors of the public. I hope that the Minister will think again. Even if he is not prepared to accept that amendment now, he may have second thoughts before Report. I live in hope that the Government will realise their folly and table an even better amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish first slightly to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). His perception of the Government broadly corresponds with the public's perception of them, namely, that they are a Government of incompetent Ministers stumbling from one decision to another with reckless regard for the national interest. I doubt whether many of us would disagree with that analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I slightly disagree with my hon. Friend because I sometimes believe that among those who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
stumble out of direction there are those who have an ideological thread running through their stumbling. My hon. Friend referred to the Secretary of State for Transport, who, I believe, is an ideological stumbler. He might well run into so many barriers simply because of his ideological commitments. Therefore, this debate and the Minister of State's unsatisfactory response to it must be looked at in terms of the Government's general attack upon public transport. My hon. Friend was right to say that, in a whole range of their policies, the Government are penalising those in our society who can least afford to provide certain services for themselves. This additional imposition on public transport will be a further imposition upon those who fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must consider the Minister of State's response alongside the debates on the Transport Bill in which my hon. Friends the Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Burnley (Mr. Pike) played such a prominent part in the Standing Committee proceedings. It is a sad day when a Government fail to listen to such reasoned and moderate arguments as my hon. Friends put forward then. But again, unfortunately, dogma and ideology overcome common sense. The amendment is moderate and sensible, as one would expect from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), but it has been rebuffed by the Government in terms that did not do justice to the argument put forward in a statesmanlike manner by my hon. Friend in opening the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we need to look at the matter in the context of the Transport Bill, we also need to look at it in relation to the Local Government Bill. We shared the experience of that Bill in the darker days of the winter, as you will recall, Mr. Leadbitter. The Local Government Bill reduced the element of public subsidy, thereby privatising the cost of transport and reducing the public service, which is in line with the provisions of the schedule and which our amendment is trying to alleviate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I think my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby will have noted, it is not without great significance that in those areas in which people regularly vote for a high public subsidy for a low-cost public service—I refer to south Yorkshire and the changes that were made in west Yorkshire the authorities that have run the risk of acting contrary to Government policy and dogma are now being threatened with abolition. Those authorities may not necessarily be abolished, because of events in the other place. We must await developments. People have expressed a profound preference through the ballot box for subsidised public transport. The Government are taking away that right. Therefore the amendment should be debated in its wider context. There is an ideological coherence that pushes costs on to public transport so that it has to privatise and reduce services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that a consistent test had been used for many years to define what was meant by full road running costs. With respect, that definition is out of date. If we are to move towards a sensible transport policy and sensible use of space in our cities, we need a different set of criteria from those currently in the full road running costs definition that the Government use. Those of us who represent inner cities recognize
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
immediately the need for a new definition. Indeed, for some of my constituents to see a definition of full road running costs without account being taken of the environmental implications of motorways running through their back yards, is very strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leeds has been damaged over the years by the planners of a series of motorway routes. To use a definition that does not take account of the social, personal and environmental costs is wrong and we must try to persuade the Government to change the nature of the full road running costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised by the comments made by the Minister. He said that the objective of the increase in the tax on coaches and buses is to move towards the full road running costs. That was not the argument used by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he introduced his Budget. He used that argument for lorries and heavy goods vehicles, but not for coaches and buses. It may be wise for the Government to take the opportunity and say that the reason why fares will be increased is because they believe that it is right for coaches and buses to pay the full cost. They should have the courage to say that, but I suspect that that is not the criterion that the Government used in taking their decision. If that were the criterion used for determining the level of vehicle exise duty, surely the Minister's argument falls in another respect. He said that the costs for car owners would be much lower than the duty that they pay for their cars. If that is true, the Minister should say, "I'm increasing the costs for lorries and coaches."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least their running costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear the Minister's intervention as it makes my argument. In other words, the Minister is saying that the only criterion used by the Government for taking their decision is that of running costs. Their objective over a period is to increase the excise duty on coaches and buses to achieve that target. We shall examine next year's Budget with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the criterion that was used, the Minister should be advocating a reduction for car owners. According to his earlier arguments, he said that car owners paid more than the full road running costs. If so, there should be a reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that that argument has been produced by civil servants for the benefit of the Committee. The Minister needed a brief to respond to my hon. Friend's moderate and sensible amendments. Therefore, they produced one that referred to the full road running costs. The Government's changes are an attack on public transport and I suspect that the figures, like all the other figures that we have considered tonight, were pulled out of the air in a typically ad hoc manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to believe from the Minister's earlier response that we are dealing with a logical set of criteria. We are talking about Government by ad hocery rather than Government by models which can be examined and criticised. I hope that the Minister at least has the courage to say that the Government have no such criteria and that what they really want is the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that important point about the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
response when he said that the increase in VED was more than inflation. Yet it is understood that car owners more than contribute to track costs already. There was a non sequitur in the Minister's argument and I noticed that the Minister skated over it as though he realised that his argument was illogical. If the Minister believes that his argument is logical, I should like him to explain it clearly so that we can judge it after due consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with a straightforward matter. We should not use the argument that, as buses are a social service, VED on buses should be lower than it would be if buses were to cover their track costs. The reason is that not only is there bus transport, but rail transport which is an alternative form of public transport. Rail transport has to cover its track costs because there is no subsidy. If the Transport Bill is enacted, many problems will arise because many metropolitan areas provide section 20 grants which may not be paid in future. That means that the alternative form of transport will be at a great disadvantage as it will have to cover its own track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After deregulation, there will be much parallel running and I am not sure whether it is right in those circumstances to give a public or private operator a subsidy for parallel running when such a subsidy is not enjoyed by the railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said that we needed a different model and a different set of criteria, I hoped that my hon. Friend would consider the point that was implicit in my argument. I said that railways might have beneficial costs in environmental terms and in other respects as well. An efficient Government should take account of the many factors to which my hon. Friend has already referred. In that sense, there is no disagreement between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I did not disagree with my hon. Friend, even though I perhaps appeared to. We must have an integrated transport system, but the Government are seeking to dismantle it. The Transport Bill will allow the two forms of public transport to compete on equal terms and if a subsidy is to be given to bus and coach operators, it will be unfair on the rail system if it has to cover its track costs, environmental costs, policing costs and so on. I do not have to restate the arguments. Under a Socialist system of transport, none of those problems would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that under deregulation private operators will simply register for a service and be able to run the profitable routes in city centres. I shall not repeat the arguments, but suffice it to say that under the Government's ethos and principles of a deregulated bus system with everyone being able to compete without subsidy, it would be wrong to allow operators to operate on profitable city routes and allow them even more subsidy by running buses and coaches that do not pay their track costs. Therefore, I also have doubts about that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many gaps in our public transport system that are not being filled. We have a public transport system where, in almost every part of the country, it costs too much when it should cost less. If it costs less, people who desperately need to travel, such as old-age pensioners, mothers with children and the handicapped, could do so, but they are unable to travel because costs are too high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Leadbitter. I believe that I am speaking directly on the amendment about whether to reduce the vehicle excise duties for buses and coaches. I agree that I do not always speak on the amendment and there are times when I can be called to order, but I do not think that this is one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, there are many people who want and need to travel, but, because of our system of transport, they cannot. In spite of my difficulties of principle with the amendment, if it is pressed to a Division I shall support the Opposition—I am sorry to disappoint some hon. Members—because it is important that we should keep the cost of our coach and bus services as low as possible to allow people who need to travel to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendments have inevitably been grouped, we have really had two debates. We have been discussing taxis and also coaches and buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to the amendment as it will affect taxis, the Minister mentioned the possibility of tax evasion. He told us—it was news to me—that some people were taking advantage of the lower rate of excise duty on taxis to run their private cars—I believe that was what the Minister was hinting. It is true that before the Finance Bill the tax on a taxi was half the rate of tax on a private car. The Bill still proposes that it should be half the rate of tax on a private car. We have put forward amendments consistent with each other that will keep that relationship, so that was no argument to put against our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not valid for the Minister to say that if we carry the amendment to reduce a tax on taxis from £50 to £47.50 people will rush to change their cars to private taxis. I am unsure how one does that and the Minister was not too explicit, but he is obviously worried about thousands of people rushing to do that. I would have thought that the incentive arose from a difference between £90 and £45, or between £100 and £50. I do not believe that the difference between £50 and £47.50 will lead to many people trying to class their cars as taxis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the Committee that Opposition Members have learnt that there is an even bigger loophole. If someone is going about trying to evade vehicle excise duty by getting his car classed as a taxi, I have better, free advice, which I shall give him. We have learnt tonight that all the person has to do is to call himself a trader and then the amount will be £46. That is another concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point about concession. The Minister says that taxis already have a concession. I agree that that is so, but traders have a bigger concession. I find it difficult to distinguish between a man who makes his living through selling cars and someone
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
who makes his living by driving a taxi. I have rather more sympathy with the taxi driver but I do not see that there is any consistency or logic about the different rates of vehicle excise duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admitted that taxis are meeting more than their full running cost on the roads. He compared them with cars and said that by implication the cars are meeting more than the full cost. I must not return to our previous amendment, but the Minister gave the case away when he admitted that a colossal extra burden is placed on a private motorist, private motor cyclist and the driver of a light van. We shall bear that in mind in our debates next year. However, the Minister cannot hold that against us. We wished to reduce the tax on motorcycles cars and light vans to the same extent as that on taxis. We wish to preserve the relationship and the ratio that the Government have obtained. We are saying that the increases should not be 11 per cent on any of those vehicles and we are being consistent when we say that the increase should be only 5 per cent on taxis, and on motorcycles, cars and light vans. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central puts his finger on that point when he said that cars must be paying more than their share of the cost of the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, no Conservative Member has tried to twist the tail of the Opposition Members about advocating lower taxes on taxis. There are those who think that it is rather strange for a Labour spokesman to advocate a lower rate of tax on a vehicle which is used by the wealthier sections of the community. I do not agree with that point of view. Many people on low and middle incomes must use taxis from time to time. Many elderly and disabled people and those who are mentally or physically handicapped need to use taxis to go to hospitals, day centres, homes and so on. Many women, especially young women, need to use taxis at night for reasons of personal security, which I am sure we all appreciate. The clause would not benefit simply those who use taxis in the City of London. We are anxious about people in the country as a whole, especially those in rural and urban areas. We are arguing for a reduction in the fixed cost of running a taxi. We are saying that the vehicle excise duty on a taxi should increase in line with inflation, no more and no less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other aspect of the two amendments—the vehicle excise duty levy on coaches and buses. In his intervention, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State reminded us that the Government subsidises public transport by £1 billion. That, at least, is what is left of the subsidy on public transport after six years of this Government. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing for the Government to be proud of in their record of expenditure on public transport, and if he wishes to disagree with me I shall invite him to come to my constituency, where there is a bus manufacturer who has declared not tens, not dozens nor even hundreds but thousands of redundancies. That is not just at Metro-Cammell Weyman but also Metro-Cammell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of my hon. Friends come to the Palace of Westminster by public transport. They travel either on a bus, which was probably made in my constituency by Metro-Cammell Weyman, or by tube on rolling-stock which perhaps was made by Metro-Cammell in my constituency. Both parts of that business have declared thousands of redundancies. The number of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
people employed at those factories is negligible compared with the numbers employed when the Government took office. We see the end result because the users of public transport generate demand for my constituents' products-buses and trains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched upon an important point in the Government's philosophy. Is it not right that the expenditure of capital on buses generates production and activity in the private sector? Is it not also right that the Government do not recognise the link between the public and private sectors? My hon. Friend has spoken of redundancies in his constituency. We have experienced the same in Leeds because of the closure of the C H Roe bus factory—a direct result of cutbacks in public capital expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. What he has said applies to public transport expenditure and to housing expenditure. There have been even more redundancies there, with the result that a tremendous number of people are unemployed as a direct result of the reduction in public expenditure on housing. But we must not stray; we are talking about the effects of VED on coaches and buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) was slightly mistaken in linking the Government's resistance to the amendments to their attempts to privatise what is currently regarded as public transport in the sense that it is operated by public undertakings. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) was nearer the point in drawing attention to the fact that the amendments would benefit private bus operators also. They would make no distinction between the buses and coaches operated by public and private operators. That is not our purpose. We are concerned about the passengers who pay vehicle excise duty through their fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer the following thought to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. Given that the amendments would benefit the private bus operator, I am offering to help. Next year, there should be a party political broadcast before the local elections featuring those two elderly ladies in the Primrose coach or bus running from Leominster to Shobdon in my county of Hereford and Worcester, who will say how grateful they are to the Government for having reduced vehicle excise duty paid by that private bus operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will help the Government to write the script of the party political broadcast on the eve of next year's district elections. I do not think that they will accept, but I remind them that the amendments would benefit the bus business that is subsidised by the county council, and they would also benefit ratepayers. That privately operated bus service would not have to be subsidised by rates because we would reduce the fixed costs of the bus operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt my hon. Friend the Members for Leeds, Central and I disagree slightly about the impact of the clause and the Government's motives in resisting it. But where my hon. Friend and I are at one is that we recognise that there is no logic in the Government's approach to the issue of vehicle excise duty. Their decisions are ad hoc, as my hon. Friend said. They are based more on the Government's need to increase

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By way of a number of hand signals and facial expressions, I have been informed that my intervention on the Sinclair electric vehicle will be answered during the course of the Minister's reply to this debate. I could say a few other words, but I do not intend to detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses refer to the need for full road track running costs to be paid by heavy goods vehicles, and I wish to examine the tables shown on page 91 of the Bill and press the Government about the extent to which that is really the case. I do not understand what the difference is in terms of appearance and effect on the roads, because vehicles have tyres ranging from a farmer's goods vehicle to a rigid vehicle. If we consider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
a 12 to 13-tonne rigid goods vehicle, we find that a two-axle vehicle has a rate of £410, whereas the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we suspended for the Division in the House, I was commenting on an inconsistency in the Government's figures in pursuit of their declared policy of full road track running costs in relation to heavy goods vehicles. I find it hard to distinguish between general haulage, rigid goods vehicles and farmers' goods vehicles. On page 91 of the Bill, in schedule 2, there is a table showing that for vehicles of 12 to 13 tonnes with two axles, new rate of duty is £410; I am speaking now of general rates for rigids. However, the amount for an equivalent farmer's goods vehicle is £175. Are we to assume that either the rigid goods vehicle rate is higher than its full road track running costs and that the real figure is the £175 for farmers' goods vehicles, or that the £410 is the correct rate and the lesser duty a subsidised rate, so to speak?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it be that farmers do not spend as much time driving up and down the M1 as the other people do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may draw that conclusion, but there is no evidence for it. Again, the Minister must not make a "guestimate" of the mileage involved; he must give us the evidence on which the conclusions were drawn to substantiate the Government's position. The same ratio exists between the general rates for 15 to 17-tonne vehicles. For risids, the amount is £1,030, while for farmers' goods vehicles it is only £335, or one third. It must be remembered that to all intents and purposes we are discussing precisely the same vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may wish to call in aid the case put by his hon. Friend, but he might not find it very easy to substantiate another example. The rate shown for a rigid goods vehicle for haulage of 29 to 30.49 tonnes with four or more axles is £2,420 per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 midnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn to page 94 and compare that with the rate of duty for articulated vehicles, again with four axles. Let us take a four-axle vehicle of 29 to 31 tonnes, which has two axles on the tractor unit and two axles on the trailer, totalling four axles. That gives a figure of £2,450 for a four-axle vehicle. Therefore, we have three different figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the farmers' goods vehicles. The same articulated vehicle has two axles on the tractor, two axles on the trailer of approximately the same tonnage, which gives another figure of 055. That gives four different rates for what constitutes the same tonnage with the same number of axles. If the Government intend to secure full road track running costs, perhaps the Minister will be able to explain this differential between the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) has identified other anomalies in relation to these tonnages. The Minister should be able
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
to give us a full explanation of these differentials, and we intend to press him for it. The Government themselves have insisted on the use of the term full road tracking running costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. Friend. I am also somewhat perplexed about the schedule, especially when remembering what some Conservative Members and Ministers said on last year's Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 91 the rates in table A refer to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"rates of duty on rigid goods vehicles exceeding 12 tonnes plated gross weight".</p></blockquote>
The two-axle vehicle has had the rate of duty increase, certainly for vehicles exceeding 13 tonnes, but not exceeding 14 tonnes, for those exceeding 14 and not exceeding 15, and 15 not exceeding 17. Does the increase mean that that class of vehicle now covers its track costs? That has always been a vague area. Ministers have said that they have tried to get towards vehicles at least covering their track costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
General rates in Table A show the increases for vehicles with four or more axles. Rates for vehicles of 25 to 27 tonnes have increased to £1,000; for vehicles of 27 to 29 tonnes, to £1,470; and for those of 29 to 30.49 tonnes, £2,420. Does that mean that the rates have gone up so that they now cover their track costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) mentioned Table A(1) and the rates for farmers' goods vehicles. The Government have said that they want to bring those into line so that they cover their track costs, and presumably they will take into account the points raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). However, I wonder whether the rates for farmers' goods vehicles—certainly for rigid goods vehicles—are somewhere near their track costs. Table A(1) shows an increase from 060 to £725 a rise of more than 100 per cent. Clearly something was wrong last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be no change in Table C. Why is that? Should not those costs increase in line with inflation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that they should not. However, the increases cover at least track costs. As track costs increase so, presumably, should the rates in Table C. My understanding is that there is no change. The table deals with tractor units. For example, column four states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a tractor unit to be used only with semi-trailers with not less than two axles".</p></blockquote>
I expect that most damage is done around the 29 tonne to 32 tonne range. I was under the impression that such vehicles did not yet have to pay VED, which was truly representative of their track costs. My third question is whether that arrangement is still in use. If so, why has the Minister not increased Table C?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Table C(1) for farmers has increased in line with what the Government have stated to be their intention, but the increase is not so great as that in Table A(1). For example the figure in the bottom right-hand corner of Table C(1) used to be £1,020 and is now £1,300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally there is no change in Table D, which covers rates of duty on tractor units exceeding 12 tonnes having three or more axles. Such vehicles do not cause as much damage as those in Table C, but there appears
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
to be no change from last year. Why is that? Are those vehicles at least covering their track costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Workington I shall press the Minister for answers. We cannot compare them with what the Parliamentry Under-Secretary of State for Transport said last year because he did not serve on the Committee then, but at least we shall be able to compare them with what one of the Treasury Ministers of State said last year. If we have Ministers, answers this year on record we shall have a better idea of Government policy when we consider next year's Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentry Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Michael Spicer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first answer the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). The Sinclair C5 is classified as an electrically assisted pedal cycle and is not subject to VED because it is considered an energy-saving machine. There is no intention of imposing VED on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's detailed questions on schedule 2 can be broadly classified into questions on why there is discrimination in favour of agricultural vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that there has been a concessionary rate of as low as 16 per cent for agricultural vehicles. Indeed, it is part of the purpose of this schedule and clause 4, which triggers it, that VED paid on agricultural equipment should more closely approximate the usage that the equipment makes of the road. The answer was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), who said, "Because I do not trundle up and down the M1 as much as other vehicles."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surveys shows that road usage by agricultural vehicles is about 60 per cent of the average use by other vehicles. The intention is to link the ultimate concessionary rate to the proportional usage that agricultural vehicles make of roads, compared with other vehicles. That is the logic of the schedule. I hope that the hon. Member for Workington will accept that this is not a jump from a very low concessary rate to a much higher and less generous rate for agriculture. The rate has now been agreed, but it will end up with a much closer approximation to the amount of usage that agricultural equipment makes of the roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be saying that a farmer will buy a 36-tonne to 38-tonne tractor unit—a Mann, Mercedes, a Scania or a Volvo might cost anything from £25,000 to 05,000—and then park it for most of the year, having made that substantial investment in it. The Minister assumes in the calculation of one third of the full price that the unit is used for only one third of the time. I cannot believe that a farmer will use a tractor of that value on so few days in the year. [Interruption.] The Government Whip intervenes from a sedentary position. Perhaps he wishes to add weight to my argument. He refuses to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, I cannot believe that a farmer will keep this expensive equipment— it could be worth £45,000, with a trailer— idle for eight months of the year. I simply do not believe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

£45,000-worth units—big Volvos and Scanias—he is not living in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the other point that the Minister has not yet answered. I mentioned four different vehicles rigid vehicles which were either for general haulage or for farming, and articulated vehicles which were either for general haulage or for farming. They all had four axles—in the case of the rigids, one in front and three at the rear; in the case of the artics, two in the front and two at the rear. Yet the taxation for those vehicles is respectively £2,420, £725, £1,680 and £525.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman, we discard the farmers' vehicles, we are comparing E1,680 with £2,420. But we are talking about exactly the same vehicles, apart from the fact that there is a "dead man" between them—that is where the "artic pin" comes in. They both have four axles, they carry exactly the same materials and they both run general haulage. Perhaps the Minister can explain the substantial difference of some £800 in the tax paid on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the weight transmitted by the axle on the road. Perhaps the Minister ought to explain the complicated formula involved. I shall be interested to learn whether the difference is as great as my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Minister four questions—about tables A and A(1), and about tables C and D, in which there is no change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in full flood, and had allowed the hon. Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) to intervene.

I can best deal with the hon. Gentlemans' very proper questions by making one or two general points. The first concerns agriculture. We accept that the present position is full of anomalies. Indeed it is the purpose of this part of the Bill to put that right. There are anomalies both with respect to the differences between the concessions on agricultural equipment and those on other forms of equipment and leading us back to the other question—with respect to the differences between the rigid and articulated categories. We are trying to correct the anomalies so that the excess of revenue over costs bears a greater relationship than at present to vehicles' track cost and usage. Articulated vehicles pay very heavy fuel duty. I remind the Committee that fuel duty accounts for two thirds of the total revenue, with the VED element—if one is trying to balance the equation—as the residue. We accept that there are anomalies, the greatest of which is that the articulated vehicles pay substantially more than rigid vehicles. But that is a broad generalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
In order to consider the tables in any detail. one must take many other factors into account. For example, axle loading is a key factor in determining track costs, and explains why, within the categories, as the load is spread between axles, so the track costs, proportionately, come down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members wish to ask any specific questions, I am only too willing to answer them in writing and to circulate my replies to other members of the Committee. We are reaching the realms of, if not higher semantics, higher mathematics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that we are starting from a position with many anomalies. The schedule seeks to iron those out. I have tried to describe the anomalies, and what we are trying to do about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is refeshing to hear the Minister say that there are anomalies and that he accepts that the position is a mess, so I do not wish to press him further. I shall be satisfied with what the Minister has had to say, provided that he will ask his Department to look at the tables, so that at next year's Finance bill Committee we will find some rationale in the figures. If there is no rationale now, there is nothing we can do about it; let us move on as quickly as possible I know that I am speaking for myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), but I do not wish to be misinterpreted. The mess has been inherited from the past, and the Bill is trying to put it right gradually. I concede what the hon. Gentleman has said; we will get the mess put right increasingly as time goes on. One cannot change these things overnight. The schedule is a first attempt to move in the direction that he, I think, seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for the Minister's offer presumably, to go through the proceedings of the Committee, and to deal with any questions raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) and for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). He said that he will circulate the other members of the Committee at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful for the Minister's assurance. Will he at the same time give us some information about the difference between revenue yield and "full road track cost" I think it is called, for rigid and for articulated vehicles. I am not asking the Minister to answer such a detailed question this evening, but an answer would help us in preparing for next year's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we leave the stand part debate, will one of the Ministers tell us what is the increase in revenue yield from heavy goods vehicles anticipated in this year's provisions? Last year we were told what the total revenue yield would be from petrol tax and duty. What will the total be this year, or could we have a percentage figure? We would like whichever it is most convenient for the Minister to give us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The forecast revenue yield from VED in 1985–86 is about £2.5 billion, compared with an outturn figure of just under £2.25 billion for the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would a breakdown of those figures be useful, or would it be more helpful if I circulated one to the Committee? I could go through the various items for 1985–86.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Private and light goods vehicles will produce £1.97 billion; cycles and so on, £24 million; hackney carriages,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
£9 million; tractors and agricultural machines, £8 million; heavy goods vehicles, £448 million, and trade licences, £4 million. Those figures total £2,465 million. I would be happy to circulate a note with that breakdown if it has not already been made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In last year's debate we were given the full revenue yield, including the tax on derv. We do not wish to delay the Committee. The Minister has been kind and said that he will write to us and give figures comparable to last year's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the schedules, I am surprised to find that there have been no reductions, apart from the reduction applying to showmen's goods vehicles. If the rejigging of vehicle excise duty is supposed to reflect full road costs for each type of vehicle, I am surprised that there are no more reductions, because that is what one would expect. Some vehicles are overtaxed at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I respond to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), who has asked me to look at the record and write to him on specific points. I shall be happy to do that, and I shall make sure that the correspondence is circulated to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman said that there were no reductions except for the duty on showmen's vehicles. That is not true in real terms. By keeping rates stationery, one makes real cuts. Unusually, in any form of taxation, that is what happens, but in relative terms what the hon. Gentleman says is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the Economic Secretary told us last year that the total revenue yield on heavy goods vehicles exceeded their full road track costs by 17 per cent. There is no way in which inflation in the past 12 months means that there must be an increase this year. With a 17 per cent margin last year, I am still amazed that there are no reductions in money terms and that we are simply told that stability is equal to reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has never been any attempt to imply that there was not an excess of revenue over cost. We have said that they should at least match. We also want to make sure that where there is a gross excess relative to the excess on other vehicles, as there has been in some cases, it should be brought more into line, but no Government recently have tried to equate revenue directly with costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. I am sure that the Minister does not mean to be inaccurate, but he is inaccurate. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the pattern of duty on lorries will be changed to correspond more closely to the amount of wear and tear that they cause to the roads."—[Official Report, 19 March 1985; Vol. 75, c.709.]</p></blockquote>
I gathered from that that some heavy goods vehicles were not paying for the wear and tear that they were inflicting on our roads. We are now being told that the tax does not reflect the wear and tear but that the Government are determined to have a fair profit, or the same rate of profit, from each class of heavy goods vehicle. The Minister has been rather misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, what has happened about the Department of Transport survey that we were promised in Committee last year about tax evasion and what the Government intended to do about it? I have seen no results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a brief comment, as it is pertinent to what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister kindly said that he would write to all members of the Committee setting out why the tables had been produced as they have. I hope that he will bear in mind that tables C and D are unchanged. Presumably they remain unchanged for some reason. I should like to know why duty on vehicles around the 30-tonne weight is unchanged. I understand that such vehicles do not cover their costs. I should like to know the Government's thinking on the matter, and I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind when he drafts his response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that much of that information is available from the Transport and Road Research Laboratory, but Members of Parliament do not have time to assimilate it. It would be helpful to have the information in a succinct form so that hon. Members could be satisfied that the Government were trying to achieve their objective, which overall I support, but I should like to be convinced that they are going about it in the right way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my reasons for extracting some figures that I thought might show the anomalous nature of what the Government had done on this occasion was that I wished to emphasise that for rigid goods vehicles there had been a substantial increase in the VED payment. For the 15–17 tonne range rigids the increase has been 21.2 per cent, for three-axle rigids from 23–25 tonnes the increase has been 28.8 per cent, but for four-axle rigids from 29–30 tonnes the increase has been 15.2 per cent. Those are all substantial increases in terms of rigid vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) made a pertinent intervention when he referred to a statement made last year about an examination that would take place on tax evasion. I have saved by comments on tax evasion until the end of the debate because I believe that the way in which the new excise duty arrangements have been introduced has set up a regime that will allow far more tax evasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a distinction in general terms between the use of tractor and trailer articulated vehicles for long-distance haulage and rigids which are invariably employed for local use, I mean vehicles for coal-carrying or gravel-carrying. Often, vehicles which carry such materials are operated by short-haul, small local operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cowboys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may call them cowboys, but however he might wish to describe them, invariably it is the local, small, transport hauliers who use rigid vehicles. For a time I ran several heavy goods, 28-tonne gross, Scania vehicles, so I have some experience. According to my information, when offences in this regard are discovered, it is usual that those who do not pay the vehicle excise duty are the smaller operators. The companies involved in national haulage are usually so well-managed that there is no means by which they can evade this form of taxation. It is similar to the fact that in larger companies there tends to be less interference or abuse of tax law because employees of such companies refuse to participate in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
such illegal activity. Such abuse tends to occur far more in smaller companies, where the entrepreneur has direct access and is responsible for the book-keeping records. I believe that it is much the same in haulage companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill raises the tax for the kinds of vehicles that invariably are used by small hauliers, although it has already been established in terms of the previous prosecution and detection policies of the Department of Transport that smaller hauliers are more likely to evade taxation. I believe that the schedule embodies a clear incentive for people not to pay vehicle excise duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take an interest in such matters. Even among long-distance haulage artic users, who are haulage contractors but are the smaller ones, there is considerable evasion now. The Minister must be aware of it. He has only to call at a lorry park on the M1 and walk around the vehicles to examine them. I often wonder why more people from the Department of Transport do not do precisely that, although I am told that inspectors carry out inquiries and go out to examine vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a large area of abuse. A further incentive for abuse is embodied in the schedule. The wrong decision has been taken. I believe that a parliamentary question tabled in 12 months' time, immediately before discussing the subject on next year's Budget, would reveal that there had been an enormous increase in the incidence of prosecution of small operators running the rigid vehicles that were in the tax bands which now have been substantially increased over and above the level of inflation. That will be a reflection on the Government and on their policy decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a strange argument of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that, because we think that there is likely to be an element of evasion of a certain category to be taxed, we should not tax them. I think that he may be misinformed and certainly his hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) was misinformed if he was implying that there had not been a publication of the survey that was carried out on evasion. I refer to a written answer given by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State on 18 December in which he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A report prepared by the Government's statistical service and published today by my Department gives an estimate of some 00 million to £1 10 million for annual revenue loss; 3.5 to 5 per cent of vehicle excise duty revenue due in Great Britain in 1984-85. The best estimate in the amount of revenue will be lost due to evasion this financial year is £90 million—just over 4 per cent."—[Official Report, 18 December 1984, Vol. 70, c. 133.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All hauliers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but that would include much smaller, localised vehicles even than those imagined by the hon. Gentleman. If we consider only heavy goods vehicles, I suspect that the level of evasion would be far lower for the sorts of reasons that he suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Transport is currently running several campaigns and employing 1,000 inspectors to tighten up on the existing evasion, which is unacceptable. However, I believe that it has been exaggerated, especially by the public accounts committee which gave an estimate of 8 per cent. That is the basis of much concern. Our survey shows evasion of 4 per cent. We are carrying out a major drive in many hon. Gentlemans' constituencies and intend to continue to do so, but the matter has been exaggerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister should subscribe to the Public Accounts Committee's estimate. The figure of 8 per cent—and the 13 per cent in Scotland—was based on the last survey that his Department carried out. It was not based on the Public Accounts Committee's figures, and he should put that right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. I was under the impression that the survey was carried out by an independent source. My main point is that the figure which the PAC publicised on which people based their concerns was 8 per cent. The survey which we carried out last December produced the 4 per cent figure. I do not wish to be thought to say that it is not unacceptable; we are trying to bring it down even further. However, there has been an element of exaggerated thinking. I think that that is some answer to the two hon. Gentlemans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. The Minister replied with some force and vigour to my suggestion that we had not seen the results of his survey, and he referred me to a written answer on 18 December. That is not good enough. Last year, the Economic Secretary told the Committee that the Department of Transport would undertake a survey to estimate the annual loss of revenue from evasion—that is the point which the Minister has answered. The Economic Secretary assured us that the survey would identify the pattern of evasion by region or vehicle type in order to employ policy resources as effectively as possible. He told us that the survey would examine differences between Scotland and England or different regions. It would try not only to establish differences but see what factors may be leading to them and that the enforcement issue was more closely related to the degree of deterrence of the fines imposed and that the survey would take that into account. That is much different from the global estimate of how much revenue the Government are losing. I conclude that the Government have been exposed as having no logic. They have based their decisions on ad hoc arguments. They have not thought through the whole issue of vehicle excise duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend could ask the Minister for all the additional information that we were promised in the form of a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer summarised the matter. I could have read two more pages of summary about the regional dispersion by category types and the further information to be found in the bulletin, "Vehicle Excise Duty Evasion in Great Britain", published today at a price of £12. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the details are there as promised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I misunderstood his earlier reference. I thought that he had read all the answer. It is clear that he read only the first couple of paragraphs. However, my basic point stands. The Government have not thought through the issue of vehicle excise duties. It is clear that we will not get satisfaction by continuing our debate. I assure my hon. Friends that the Opposition Front Bench will raise this matter again. By Report we shall have received correspondence from the Minister and be able to argue the point with more precise facts. Nothing will be

gained this evening by pressing the Minister for detailed answers which clearly he cannot give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 2 agreed to.</i></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 9</div> <!-- clause -->

	<div class='title'>VEHICLES EXCISE DUTY: FEES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said at the beginning of our discussion some hours ago, we have received useful notes from the Treasury. The notes on the clause tell us that its purpose is to charge a fee of Q for the issue of a temporary first licence. We are told that the facility is designed to help motor dealers in rural areas when a new vehicle needs to be put on the road quickly. What are these temporary licences? What is the problem for motor dealers? Why is it a problem in rural areas, as distinct from urban areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Opposition Whip provokes me, we shall go on even longer. I shall try to be as brief as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). The clause is technical, and that is why I, as Under-Secretary of State for Transport, am dealing with it. It allows the agent of the Secretary of State for Transport—or the Post Office in practice—to charge a £2 fee for issuing a temporary first licence. Motor dealers are able to give that first licence to effect a transaction. It allows time to issue the full licence, the charge for which dates from the issue of the temporary licence. It is a way of facilitating transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme, which is on a 12 month trial from January this year, is designed to help motor dealers in rural areas who would otherwise have to travel long distances to one of the 51 nearest local vehicle licensing offices. The trial areas are in Scotland, Newport and the Isle of Wight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motor trade likes the scheme because it facilitates the transaction of motor vehicles and helps to create employment—objectives which I am sure are shared on both sides of the House. We want as many motor vehicles to be transacted as possible. The trade is happy for the scheme to be self-financing. The Post Office will retain the £2 fee to cover its costs. The money will not go into the Consolidated Fund. I think that everyone is happy with the scheme and it saves the Exchequer from funding that facility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how the scheme increases the sale of motor cars. If the Minister thinks that it does, he must live in a different world. I am still not clear about the temporary licences. Every time that I have bought a car—and I belong to that category of people who pay for their own cars—it is taxed when I get it, but not with a temporary licence. Perhaps the licence runs for only six months instead of 12 months. I have been caught that way once or twice. However, they have been ordinary licences. I do not know anything about the temporary licences. There are traders' concessions anyway. No doubt the Minister will explain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the scheme covers only some rural areas. Who defines what is a rural area in this context? It seems that the whole procedure is shot with questionable issues. However, I shall not raise them at this hour. I am disappointed that the Minister has not been able to give satisfactory answers to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
