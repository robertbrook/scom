	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. John MacGregor)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Milk (Cessation of Production) Bill, the Committee does meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
The objective of the Bill, which has been widely welcomed is simply to give proper statutory auth orisation to the outgoers scheme —</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is a little unusual for the Minister to begin in that way. I should put the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i> Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first amendment, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution on the Bill, and copies are available in the Room. I also call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PAYMENTS TO PERSONS CEASING MILK PRODUCTION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 9, after " producing ", insert " or restrict production of ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 11, after " all ", insert " on part of ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are eager to hear the preliminary remarks that the Minister is so keen to make about the Bill. He said that there was wide spread support for the principle of the Bill. However, there are substantial points of detail which have given rise to widespread opposition to it. The amendment seeks to draw attention to one of them. As well as requiring outgoers under the scheme to abandon milk production entirely, or banning milk production on the holdings affected by the scheme, the Bill should allow the partial withdrawal from milk production on holdings where appropriate. That point has been put to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I draw the attention of the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) to the fact that he is not a member of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Maxwell-Hyslop 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a great disappointment to us, because the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) gave us the benefit of his opinions on Second Reading. He was one of a number of hon. Members who expressed misgivings about aspects of the Bill. Perhaps that explains why he and other hon. Members have not been chosen to sit on this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sensible alternative in the amendment has been suggested to us by responsible organisations such as the Farmers Union of Wales. It would make the scheme more flexible. It would encourage diversification of enterprises as distinct from the complete banning of milk production on the dairy farms concerned. It follows that it would protect some jobs in areas affected. The Bill will virtually outlaw milk production on a particular holding. In the west of the country, where most of our dairy farmers are concentrated, it stands to reason that a significant number of people will lose their scope for employment. That is something which should concern us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister replied to that point on Second Reading. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The straightforward answer is that Community regulations permit us only to make payments to producers who ' discontinue milk production definitively'. This means that we had to insist that outgoers surrender their entire quota which can, of course, relate to more than one farm." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 January 1985; Vol. 70, c. 960.]</p></blockquote>
The whole point seems to hinge on the interpretation of the word " definitively ". According to my copy of the " Oxford English Dictionary ", the first definition is " decisively". That does not necessarily preclude partial surrender of quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with clause 1, the notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>" It is important to note that any producer who receives compensation must surrender all his quota. Article 4(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 857/84 stipulates that production must be discontinued 'definitively', which is interpreted to mean that a producer with a number of dairy enterprises each with quota attached must give us his entire production."</p></blockquote>
I feel that we should say a bit more about the interpretation of discontinuing " definitively", and I appeal to the Minister not to hide behind the terminology of the European Community regulation. We have come to a pretty pass when the British Parliament may not even discuss the possibility of varying a scheme to compensate dairy farmers who come out of dairy farming because someone in Brussels, for instance, has put in that little word " definitively ". Presumably whoever wrote it did so in French or German; goodness knows what it sounds like in either of those languages. I dare say that those in other countries will be using rather more flexible interpretations of the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter deserving serious consideration. I hope that the Minister will do better than he did on Second Reading, because several people on dairy farms, both farmers and employees, must be acutely worried. The Minister himself has said that there is a need for flexibility in the scheme, yet he is now
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
placing what seems to many of us to be a wholly unreasonable restriction on its operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), whose amendment is in both our names. I used strong words on Second Reading when I said that the scheme was a shambles, but by today I should probably have used even stronger words. Having discussed the matter with many dairy producers in Wales and other parts of Britain, I now feel that the Government, and the Minister in particular, are introducing a scheme that will not be welcomed by producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses state, in the introductory note:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Under Article 4 of the Council Regulation (EEC) No. 857/84 Member States are permitted, but not required, to operate schemes to buy up milk quota from producers wishing to give up milk production."</p></blockquote>
It is not a matter of " must". The Government have introduced an ill-conceived scheme that is not acceptable to many dairy producers. What will be the effect of its implementation in the years to come? The scheme will do away with many small dairy farms. The Government are pressing the small dairy farmers in Dyfed and in Devon and Cornwall and other regions to give up milk production. The pattern of farming will change completely if such a scheme is implemented. I wonder what advice you have given to those dairy farmers who will give up—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should address the Committee through the Chair and not address the Minister as " you ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you say, Mr. Lamond. I was carried away with—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Devizes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his oratory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not speaking through the Chair, Mr. Lamond. The Government will do away with many small dairy farmers. Therefore, what advice has the Minister or his Department given to dairy producers who will leave the industry? If they give up their quota and sell it partially or otherwise, it is more than likely that the value of their farm will decrease by about 40 to 50 per cent. Many small farmers will be in dire trouble. The way forward is for such farmers to give up part of their quota rather than to destroy the fabric of the dairy industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are specialist dairy producers who have between 70 and 150 cows. Why will the Government not persuade the big producers, who have between 200 and 400 cows, to give up part of their dairy quota? They do not have the right to give it up, as I understand it, under the scheme. Why is the Minister so keen to exert pressure to get rid of the small but not the large producers? I am willing to give way to the Minister if he can say that a big dairy producer can sell his quota under the outgoers scheme. The Minister nods his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be more convenient if I answered all the hon. Gentleman's points when he has completed his speech. I shall certainly deal with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. I hope that he will have second thoughts about the Bill. It is ill conceived and should be thrown back into the melting pot. It should be recognised before it is too late and a viable dairy industry is destroyed. For generations fanners have thrown their capital into the dairy industry to ensure the survival of their families on small dairy farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify one point. The Bill says that the Government have the right to make a lump payment or instalments. However, there is no mention in the notes on clauses of making a lump payment to dairy producers if they accept the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong to go over the points made on Second Reading. I shall not follow the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells) by trying to counter some of his allegations about the Bill. However, both he and the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) have a serious point in tabling the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with other members of the Committee, I visited Brussels with the Select Committee on Agriculture to look into the workings of the quota scheme as proposed at that stage by the Commission. We found a willingness to inject greater flexibility into the scheme. It is essential for the Committee to try to get the maximum fairness and flexibility. I am sure that those are the two objectives that the Minister is keen to pursue. Therefore, I hope that he will look sympathetically on the amendment: if he went to Brussels he might be surprised by the reception that the Commission gave to such a proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Roger Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and supported by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells). He and I represent neighbouring constituencies, and we have fought for the farming community in south-west Wales on previous occasions. I trust that our fight today will be a little more successful than the one which we have had in the immediate past over the closure of dairy-producing establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way that we can save the small farmers in areas such as south-west Wales is by developing the outgoers scheme, enabling those farmers to have redistributed to them a scheme which will make the difference between going under and viability and allow large farms or comparatively large farms to surrender part of their quota. We hear a great deal these days of the north-south divide. Unfortunately, in agriculture we have a great east-west divide. The farming problems of the south-west—particularly the south-west of England, parts of north-west England and the whole of Wales—are not really understood
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. 1 do not know whether, in Wales, the fault lies with timidity at times on the part of the Welsh Office in putting across the case for the farmers of south-west Wales, but having taken a fair amount of sampling in south-west Wales, I know that some 30 per cent. of our farmers are in deep, desperate trouble. And they are in deep, desperate trouble to the extent that unless some form of lifebelt is thrown to them within the next few months—and the prediction is that 1985 will be even more difficult and serious than 1984—many of them will go under. As the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North said, when those farms go under they will suffer extreme financial loss. They are on a loser either way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply on Friday to the hon. Member for Meironnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Thomas), the Secretary of State for Wales gave figures of the latest tranches of litres which have now been offered on the outgoers scheme. The figures are not satisfactory, and until we are able to entice the large dairy farms in parts of the country other than the harassed south-west to give up part of their dairy quota, we shall not offer that lifeline to the small family farms of south-west Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although dairy farming is quite extensive in south-west Wales, the quality of the land is far from uniform. We have large farms in the lowlands, but the farms in the uplands are such, because of the topography and the weather, that they can be used only for dairy farming, and they can be used only for dairy farming for the survival of the family. That is the particular unit about which we are concerned. There is no possibility of such farmers diversifying. Young farmers have been advised by the Government over the past three or four years to expand, to have more cattle to increase their milk production, and there is no possibility of those people, given the quotas that they have been given, and given the secondary quotas, which have been miserly in the extreme, now having a viable farm unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great delays in the allocation of secondary quotas have led to a great deal of dissention and discord in farming communities of south-west Wales. Until now, the farming communities there have been very happy and very uniform. However, because of the complexities and the covert nature of the tribunals, in which there have been very different standards and results which farmers have not been able to understand, small farmers are becoming suspicious and acting against the best efforts of farmers in neighbouring areas. That is spoiling the rural atmosphere of south-west Wales. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendments because I do not see what else we can do to increase the amount of secondary quota available, other than make it more attractive for the large farmers to partly surrender. They can diversify, whereas the small farmers on the difficult wet uplands of Wales cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suspected, this debate has ranged beyond the amendment. I will therefore endeavour to reply to some of the wider points,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
although not all, because some go beyond the scope of the outgoers scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to say at the beginning of the Committee that the objective of this Bill is widely welcomed. That objective is to give statutory authority to the outgoers scheme in a better form than the Appropriation Act. The Bill has therefore only one purpose. It is important to get it on the statute book reasonably quickly because there have been some misunderstandings about the purpose of the Bill. All the farming unions have said that they hope that it will get through Parliament reasonably quickly, so I hope that we shall have a thorough, but speedy, examination of it. In an attempt to assist the Committee, I gave instructions for the notes on clauses to be circulated as soon as we had drawn them up. I hope all hon. Members have now received them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred a moment ago to some of the misunderstandings about the Bill. The first came in the speech of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells). I was surprised to hear him say that the Bill was not welcomed, because I have found that there has been a very general welcome for the outgoers scheme among milk producers. If he is right, I should like to ask him why I was being pressed in the Second Reading debate to extend the scheme, rather than to abolish it. Surely that pressure shows that the Opposition approve of the outgoers scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a misunderstanding about the Bill which it is very important to correct at this stage so that all dairy producers know where they stand. In 	<i>Farmers Weekly</i> of 18 January in the Editor's Diary, there was a comment about the Bill that was not only misleading, but wrong. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Until the Bill becomes law no farmer can officially quit milk production and no extra quota can be freed to help ease the genuine hardship of those who have come unstuck at the tribunals."</p></blockquote>
That comment is wrong, and I hope members of the Committee will make clear to dairy farmers in their constituencies. The outgoers scheme is going ahead. The purpose of the Bill is to give wider statutory authority for the payments, because we are paying out £50 million over five years. That is a substantial sum and too large for us to allow it to be paid through the Appropriation Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, however, we have been proceeding with the scheme under the Appropriation Act. It is therefore not true to say that no farmer can officially quit production. Nor is it true to say that no extra quota can be freed. The reverse is true. I can give the Committee the figures: 1,200 farmers have already accepted our offer to take the outgoers scheme, while 879 have already been paid. The litreage so far for those who have accepted is 145 million litres, and that commits us to pay about £12.5 million. I do hope that that makes it clear that the comment in 	<i>Farmers Weekly</i> was wrong. I also hope that milk producers will not make their decisions on the basis of that comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North also criticised the scheme because he felt that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
it was unfair to the small producers. He said at one point that we were bringing pressure to bear on small producers. Again, I should like to make it absolutely clear that that is not so. The scheme is voluntary, and no one is under any pressure to take advantage of it if he does not wish to do so. As I explained on Second Reading, we started with the small producers because we knew that the scheme was oversubscribed, and we had to have a set of priorities. We felt that it was important to give small producers who decided that they would like to take advantage of the outgoers scheme the first opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept the argument that the small producer is in a much more difficult position than the large producer. Because we were more concerned about the small producer, we wanted to give him first priority by allowing him the option to get out if he wished to do so. But there was no pressure on him; it was entirely up to him. If no dairy farmer, from Wales or anywhere else, producing under 200,000 litres had wanted to take advantage of the outgoers scheme, we would naturally have gone on to the larger producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that this time he has got his priorities wrong? Why on earth does he want to bring pressure to bear on the small producers to quit? I know that the scheme is voluntary, but the pressure is there, and many small producers have responded. It is a great shame that we are doing away with a pattern that has survived for so long in west Wales and in other parts of Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deny that absolutely. There was no pressure; it was entirely up to the individual producer to decide. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North agrees that we must have priorities. We could not have accepted every initial offer, because we would have gone way over the top. If we had started with the larger producers and excluded the smaller producers, I think that we should have suffered a good deal of criticism from the farming community because we were trapping small producers, some of whom might want to get out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the hon. Gentleman to see the matter in perspective. If no small producer had taken up the offer, that would have been fine: we would have moved on to the next level. But it was vitally important to give the small producer the option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been issuing the offers in tranches, and have now reached offers to the producers who last year had up to 338,000 litres of milk. No doubt we shall have one or two further tranches, depending on the response that we receive. I press the hon. Gentleman to make it clear to his own producers that there is no pressure on them to take up the outgoers scheme. It is for them to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another vital point which I constantly stress is that the real purpose of the scheme is to help the small producer who wants to stay in milk, so that we can give him the extra quota to bring him back to 1983 levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that on occasion during our debate we have defined " small farmer " wrongly. Stress has been laid on those keeping a herd of fewer than 40 cows. But the problem in west Wales, and other parts of Great Britain, is that some dairy farmers specialise in milk production and keep a 70 to 150-cow herd. Where on earth will they get their quota, and how will they survive in the years to come? We shall see in 12 months' time who is right, the Minister or me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is a separate point. The hon. Gentleman is changing his ground. I shall deal with that later when I come to the quotas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tabled a question asking for the introduction of an outgoers scheme because I represent some very small producers with small dairy herds, and I wanted to protect them. It is the introduction of quotas that puts pressure on such producers. The scheme is intended purely to help and protect both those who want to get out and, particularly, those who want to stay in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. If we look at what has happened so far in Wales, we see that the outgoers scheme is achieving its objective and helping the small producer who wishes to stay in. As the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke North knows, 15 per cent. of applications so far have come from Wales, but 25 per cent of the quota released will go to Wales. On balance, Wales and the small producers are benefiting considerably from the operation of the outgoers scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised one other point. He said that in the notes on clauses he could find no reference to lump sum payments. If he looks at paragraph 13 in the notes on clauses he will see the explanation of subsection (3), which deals with lump sum payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he spoke, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) said, " If the Minister goes to Brussels ". May I tell my hon. Friend that I have hardly been anywhere else but Brussels for a considerable time? He is absolutely right about flexibility. We should like to get greater flexibility into the stystem. Indeed, if we can achieve that, that might be a way of helping the sort of producer that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North mentioned in his last intervention. We are trying to pursue it in two ways. One is by getting greater flexibility for mixed businesses, on which we are making progress with the Commission. A scheme is now being examined by a special group. We hope to return to that in the February Council meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to get greater flexibility, too, through our "Mobility of Quota" paper—the con-sultative document to which I referred on Second Reading which contains several suggestions of ways in which greater flexibility could be achieved. But that is a much longer-term process which will require not only substantial consultation with industry but will clearly be difficult to negotiate in Brussels, both
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0911">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
with the Commission and with our fellow Council members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage we are bound by the existing Community regulations, which is why the Bill has to be drawn up in the way that it is. That brings me to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). He said that it was a sensible suggestion which had been made by the Farmers Union of Wales, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office, who is on the Committee, will agree that many ideas that come out of Wales are sensible. This point has been raised by others, and I am sure that he will feel that it merits serious examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer first to the reference to " definitively". We are in difficulty because the existing outgoers scheme has to operate under the existing Community rules. All our legal advice is that under those rules we are permitted to make payments only to producers who cease production altogether. That is why we have to insist that producers who receive payment and become outgoers stop dairying entirely, certainly while the quota system is in operation, and surrender all their quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about other member states. Only one other member state considered the possibility of " part-outgoer"—allowing part of the herd to be sold and coming within the scheme—and it was stopped by the Commission. So that confirms our interpretation, and I can therefore tell the hon. Gentleman that the scheme is being operated in the same way throughout all member states. As I am sure he will accept, it is dangerous for us to embark on a course when we already know that it would be outwith the regulations, because we then run the risk of action from the Commission. We are the member state which is most urging the Commission to take action when other member states seem to break the rules, so it would be wrong for us to do so. Therefore, we have to say that the present scheme applies only to those who cease production altogether. Although we are seeking some changes to the rules on the milk quota system, we have no intention at present of seeking any changes in the Community rules on that point. It would be very difficult anyway to apply it retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that the Bill would give statutory cover for any other outgoers schemes. I repeat that that is a hypothetical situation because we have no intention of introducing a further outgoers scheme; we want to make this one work. But I accept that it is sensible to consider the possibility that at some future date Community legislation will permit payments to producers who give up only part of their quota. Therefore, I accept the comments made by the hon. Member for East Lothian and others in the debate, and can accept the amendments in principle. As usual, I have to say that we would like to be able to consider the precise wording of the amendments to ensure that they fully meet all the purposes. I can give a firm undertaking that I shall bring forward my own amendments on Report to cover the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
point. I therefore hope that the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress again that we have no intention at present of introducing another outgoers scheme. Nevertheless the proposal gives the proper statutory cover should there ever be another out-goers scheme. It is therefore important to get it right and to allow future flexibility should we ever have the chance to have another scheme. We shall have covered that if we accept what is proposed in the amendment. I therefore hope that the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am overwhelmed. It is not often that we have major breakthroughs in Committee in response to amendments moved by the official Opposition. I am glad that the Minister recognises that there is an obvious case for allowing, in the drafting of the legislation, compensation through the outgoers scheme for partial cessation. I only wish that it was provided for in the current outgoers scheme. There have been comments from both sides of the Committee on why that would be desirable in order to achieve some reasonable flexibility within the scheme because of the resulting difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister managed to make his previously uncompleted introductory remarks during the course of his speech. He said that the objective of the Bill is welcome but he knows as well as I do that many of the details are deeply resented, and this is one of them. He made great play, as did his right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on Second Reading, of the £50 million received under the Appropriation Act. I wonder how that compares with what has been achieved for other objectives in the south Atlantic for instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is pitifully inadequate; everyone knows that. One of its pitiful inadequacies is that it is too restrictive. Whether or not the Minister likes it there is pressure on smaller producers to come out under the scheme. What will happen to their farms, their farmworkers and the farming communities? That it a matter for acute concern. I urge him to consider amending the scheme as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's minor, tactical concession at this stage and his acceptance of the spirit of the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>" (3B) Calculation of the payments to be made under any scheme under this section shall have regard to any redundancy costs likely to fall on persons to whom payments are to be made under the scheme.".</p></blockquote>
I have had some difficulty drafting the amendment because the Government saw fit to draft the long title of the Bill in such a way as to make it difficult to insert further considerations into the scheme. The Labour party is gravely concerned about what is likely to happen to employees who lose their jobs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
in areas where farmers take advantage of the out-goers scheme and come out of dairy production. We feel strongly about that and will press the amendment to a Division if the Minister resists it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A new word has passed, if not into our language, at least into the farming press. Based on the name of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, it is the verb " to jopple ". It is unfortunate to have a name ending in " ing ". Dr. Beeching is said to have " beeched " the railways. Likewise it is being said in some parts of the farming press that the right hon. Gentleman has joppled the dairy industry. Not only are dairy farmers being put into a difficult position as a consequence of the quota scheme but—and this is the point we want to stress —a significant number of employees are being forced into an impossible situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned restrictions in the European regulation. He cannot get away with that on this amendment because he knows that at least two other member states of the European Community— Denmark and the Netherlands—have made provision in their outgoers schemes to compensate employees who lose their jobs. Many people are being subjected to considerable stress as a result of the contraction of the dairy industry in the past 12 months. I have heard reports of attempted suicides. They have occurred because families are being thrown into turmoil when they find that they cannot continue their normal way of life, which may have been pursued in that neighbourhood for generations. It must be extremely distressing for a farmer who, like his parents before him, has made a living with a herd of dairy cows, to be told suddenly that he must cut production by 9 per cent. For a smaller farmer it means that he cannot make a living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same pressures hold true for employees on such farms. The Transport and General Workers Union has said that as many as 250 people dotted around the country may face this problem. They are the people who have built up the herds. They have done the day-to-day hard slog of milking the cows and getting to know the animals and the various lines of breeding. They are the people who put their hearts into building up the herds. Yet they are likely to be thrown on the scrap heap. It is even worse for them than for people in some industrial areas. They are often in the remoter rural areas, such as west Wales. What alternative employment do they have? If the industry is contracted, there are unlikely to be jobs in the immediate neighbourhood. At the very best they will have to move a long distance to find a job. If they want to remain in the area in which they may have lived all their life, their prospects of employment are remote. We talk about restructuring the industry, but many people will have to restructure their whole lives. We should all be concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are precedents. Where other industries have been radically restructured, such as the coal and steel industries, the Government have rightly made special provision to help those who lose their jobs to rebuild their lives. The Government have at least tried to promote new employment in the areas
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
affected. But this problem involves a small number of people, scattered all over the country, who are easy to pick off. The Government find it necessary to buy off the farming interest because it has considerable political clout—at least with the Conservative party—but will they lift a finger to assist the smaller group that will be hurt by this painful process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister will not listen to me it is a pity that he will not listen to some of his hon. Friends either, in particular the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern), who spoke with considerable passion about this matter on Second Reading. He talked not so much about dairy herdsmen, but about people working in creameries in the manufacturing part of the dairy industry. The Minister should address himself to that point. Unfortunately, it would not have been in order to table an amendment on that because of the nature of the Bill's long title. However, it is a point of principle to which the Minister and the Committee should address themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The imposition of the quota system and the manner in which it has been imposed have caused disruption in many communities and to many individuals. It is not good enough for any Government to skate over that point as the Minister and his colleagues did on Second Reading. I hope that we can make some headway in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the amendment. It seems to me that the Bill does what so many things do in our society: it ignores the small people and those less able to protect themselves. I am thinking of the small farmer in relation to the legislation, and the farmworker. Those are the people who are being ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, my union's figures show that 250 farmworkers have already lost their jobs as a result of the imposition of quotas. If Holland and Denmark can provide compensation for such people, there is absolutely no reason why our Government should not do so also, if they so desired. It is not good enough to say, as the Minister said in reply to me in the Select Committee, that the money is just not available in the EEC or in the national Exchequer. The Government are at the moment expending £86 million a week of taxpayers' money to destroy the National Union of Mineworkers, so that shows that when they really want to find the money, they can find it. If they can do that to smash a trade union, they ought to be able to find the very small amount of money that is required to compensate workers who lose their jobs because of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmworkers invest their skill, energy and expertise, which is considerable, in their work, and they are as much entitled to compensation as the farmers, particularly as the dairy industry has been very profitable. We should bear it in mind that it is the herdsman who has built up the herd to the point where compensation is realisable. Without his skill and ingenuity, the herd would never have been built up to be available for compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Let us look at the possibilities of the dairyman getting another job. Quotas are ossifying the industry and, as yields rise, absolute cow numbers will decline and there will be no new jobs for dairy workers to go to, as the sector now has a finite limit. Because we have such high unemployment in our society and because jobs are difficult to get in rural areas there will be no opportunity for the dairymen to find alternative employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that the Dutch and the Danes have managed to compensate their farmworkers to a level commensurate with the compensation which they have given to the employers, and I say again that it is up to our Government to find the necessary money to give some help to our people. Without the farmworkers there would have been no dairy industry and no profit in the dairy industry. They are as important in that partnership as the farmers are. We have the full support of the Dyfed Action Group for our demands and we fully support it in its claim for justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly that the milk quota battle was ill-conceived. The outgoers aspect merely seeks to build a straw castle on shifting sand. The view of my union is that the legislation should be opposed unless it contains provisions that satisfy us in relation to some compensation for farmworkers. There is no way that a man can be compensated for losing his job—and not only his job, but the next generation's jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by emphasising that when the Select Committee considered quotas, it felt very strongly that the Government should have found some way of compensating farmworkers for the loss of jobs. There was support for that view right across the Committee, and it was felt that the Minister should reexamine the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Torney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) mentioned creameries. He also said that farmworkers had done much to create the present situation in dairy farming, in which we are—and have been for some time—self-supporting, but not with huge surpluses. However, there has been a tremendous increase in the production of butter and so on from our creameries, and they must therefore take some of the credit for the huge rise in the production of home-produced butter over a fairly short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised the matter repeatedly on the Floor of the House during agricultural questions, and the Minister has replied almost with annoyance that nothing will be done. It does not look as if anything will be done, but, despite the Minister's annoyance, I shall continue to raise the matter. My trade union, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, has a considerable interest in food production workers, including those in dairy production, and such people are now being thrown out of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian also spoke about alternative employment. There is little alternative employment anywhere in Britain at the moment, because of the Government's apparent efforts not to assist the economy. The situation is bad
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
enough in industrial areas, such as mine used to be before so many mills shut down, but if anything it is worse in rural areas. It is not good enough for the Government to say that the normal system of redundancy is sufficient to cover the farm worker or the creamery worker who is thrown out of work because of this unjust milk quota scheme. In the rural areas there is no hope at all. The workers live in villages where there is no alternative to the farming industry, except the food industry and others associated with farming, which are sometimes some distance away. Those workers must be given special consideration, and I shall go on telling the Government that they must do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect of the problem, which affects both creamery workers and stockmen on the farms. Many farmworkers worked a fair amount of overtime when our milk production was at its peak, before the operation of the quota scheme. Not only will stockmen and other farmworkers now be made redundant because of the scheme, but those who are still working will work fewer hours. They will not work any overtime. Farmworkers' wages have never been high; they have always been among the lower-paid workers. As in so many industries, especially those with which my union is associated, overtime is useful to give them a reasonable standard of living. They deserve some compensation for the loss of that overtime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that for farmers, too, the quota scheme is bad. Britain has had a very bad deal and I am amazed that the Minister agreed to the scheme in the way that he did. I know that he argues that we have a surplus. 1 would dispute that, but if it is true, our surplus is tiny and non-existent when compared with the surpluses of France, Holland and other EEC countries. Our surplus is negligible; I suggest that there is a surplus in dairy products only when the Minister takes into account things such as New Zealand butter, which comes into this country on a quota system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee, of which I am also a member, debated the matter. We questioned the Minister about quotas, compensation for workers apart from the farmers themselves, and surpluses. The quota system is bound to lead to difficulties for farmers and farmworkers alike, and it is typical of the Government's lack of concern for ordinary working people that they are prepared to give some help to the farmer—scant and ineffective though that help may be—but are not prepared to do anything at all for the farm worker, the milk distributive worker or the dairy production worker. If the Minister does not offer us anything today, at least he will know that there is very strong criticisms both in the House and from the workers concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Roger Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what has been said on behalf of the farm workers and herdsmen. When small farms close and go out of milk-— as we shall see in the next year or so—it means that one person per farm is unemployed. From what I know of the farming industry in West
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Wales, the farm worker is either an elderly gentleman, who if he became unemployed in the present employment atmosphere in south-west Wales, will never find a job again, or a young person who has been brave enough over the past four or five years to take on work on a dairy farm. With unemployment in parts of south-west Wales approaching 25 per cent. and exceeding that figure among young people, one can envisage the despondency in the heart of a young person. One must be a particularly exceptional young person to dedicate oneself to working on a farm, with all its unsocial hours, lack of communications, non-access to the amenities of towns and so on. If he is dedicated to that type of job and suddenly finds himself out of work, that person will find very little alternative work in those rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an example of despondency in a rural area in August 1983 when a creamery at Newcastle Emlyn closed with the loss of 250 jobs. We were told—promises, promises—by the Milk Marketing Board that there would soon be innovatory products, which the dairy industry appears to be adept at producing these days, and that there would, to some extent, be a revival of employment in that area. That revival never developed. There will be no future for those who are thrown out of work when many farms cease milk production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members agree that the Government scheme has been ill-prepared and is far from comprehensive enough to deal with the small farmer. There has been some recognition of the difficulties facing the farming community. However, we are very disappointed that those who labour so hard on farms that are not their own will be entitrely discounted from any scheme. The fact that more enlightened countries, such as Denmark and Holland, have produced schemes only adds to our sense of diappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition should press the amendment to a vote because we represent those who need to be looked after in this difficult world of high unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I sympathise with all those who are affected by the quota system. I assure the Committee that we had some agonisingly difficult discussions and made equally difficult decisions on the dairy sector in the price review in the year up to March 1984. We knew that there would be consequences for some people, and we have tried to deal with them as sensibly and helpfully as possible. However, we were faced with a position in the dairy sector that no one could possibly justify in terms of sensible use of economic resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often said that if only the Council of Ministers had acted earlier on pricing and therefore given more sensible signals to the dairy producers who were expanding, we should not have had to take these quota decisions. Alas, that is not what happened. We were eventually faced with a situation that it was impossible to justify. We needed to tackle the huge surpluses building up in the dairy
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
sector. Indeed, if we had not done so, we would have had no moral or other justification for tackling the wine surpluses, which no one could possibly defend. We needed to face the fact that the surpluses were costing an astronomic sum. The dairy sector is by far the most expensive in the Community. The costs of the wine sector are rising proportionately much faster, but are still well short of the total amount that goes to the dairy sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear it in mind that the viable firms or self-employed people in rural areas who have viable businesses, who produce all their products for the market, have to bear the costs of subsidising the disposal of unwanted surpluses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Treasury line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just the Treasury line. It is a sensible economic point. There is no sense in a small industry—I have the same problem in my constituency, in some industries—continuing to produce products which are out of date or in surplus, and which the consumer does not want. That is not a sensible basis for economic life in any community. Therefore, we had to tackle the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Torney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about surpluses. Surely the surplus of dairy produce in Britain was negligible, if it existed at all. I agree that we should deal with surpluses, but let us deal with the countries that produce the surpluses. Should we bear a higher percentage of the quota cutback than France, Holland and the other countries which produce the surplus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will not be tempted to stray too far off the amendment in answering that intervention. It is rather wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall respect your ruling Mr. Lamond, although I am tempted to respond to the point to try to explain the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that we have sympathy for those who are facing difficulties, whether they stay in milk production, take advantage of the outgoers scheme or become redundant. We had to face up to those difficult choices because of the huge costs in the dairy sector, which were affecting many other industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for East Lothian, as he probably recognises, would apply only to statutory schemes made in the future and not to the present non-statutory scheme. Therefore it would not enable any redundancy payments to be made under the present scheme. However, I do not want to make too much of that point: I simply have to ensure that it is understood. I understand the drafting difficulties that the hon. Gentleman faced. However, I think he was endeavouring to discuss the principle. I hope that he recognises that the amendment would not produce any of the consequences that he and his hon. Friends have called for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the principle of the amendment. It is not really appropriate for forms of redundancy payment to be made directly or indirectly under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0915">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
outgoers scheme. The outgoers scheme is not a redundancy scheme. I have searched for precedents in other similar schemes, and there are few. Those that exist do not have redundancy payments attached to them. It is important to recall that even if payments are made under the outgoers scheme, many farmers who take advantage of it will often be able to turn to other forms of farming. That will certainly be true throughout the United Kingdom. Such farmers will remain in business as farmers or will be able to turn to other forms of occupation. The outgoers scheme will help them to get out of dairying but they will be able to turn to tourism, for example, or perhaps make use of their land in other ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tourism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does happen in many of those areas. The hon. Gentleman perhaps does not realise that already in parts of the United Kingdom a quite significant proportion of a farmer's income comes from alternative employment such as tourism, making use of his land and facilities, his attractive countryside and so on. The outgoers scheme is not a redundancy scheme. It does not follow that those who take advantage of it are unemployed. A few may find it difficult to find alternative employment, but they will continue to have an asset and can also raise funds by making use of the herd payments basis when they dispose of their herds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows very well that tourism in those areas is an adjunct of farming. It is not possible to make a living out of tourism on its own. It is not possible for the small hill farmer to diversify into other forms of farming. That is the point that we have been trying to make. The Minister may say that it is possible, but in practice those people cannot make a living in other ways. Perhaps they could make a living as sheep farmers, but I am sure that they could not make a living solely out of tourism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I chose my words carefully: I said that many farmers would be able to turn to other forms of farming, or indeed, as a supplement to their income or the payments they receive under the outgoers scheme, to other forms of employment. I did not suggest that that would be right across the board; I suggested that many would be able to do that. I made that point to show that the outgoers scheme is not for redundancy payments: payments made to farmers under the scheme are not regarded as redundancy payments. The outgoers scheme is a measure to enable the industry as a whole to adjust to the quota arrangements by making additional quota available to the smaller producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a point I made earlier in answer to the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Dr. Thomas). The whole point of the outgoers scheme is to enable us in the United Kingdom to make structural adjustments to our dairy sector so that we can help the small producers who stay in milk, and to give individual producers an incentive to release their quota. It is not a redundancy scheme in any sense, and it
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
would be inappropriate for redundancy payments to be made under it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's reasoning, although I do not necessarily agree with his conclusions. But is he saying that if employment possibilities are reduced—as they may well be in many cases—the farmer may make a private payment out of the outgoers money, but that as that will not be a legal obligation, no specific redundancy provision need be written into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. Redundancy provisions are outwith the scope of this Bill, which gives statutory authorisation for an outgoers scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now deal with the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question. The number of redundancies among farm workers is very limited so far. I heard what was said by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard), but the latest available Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food statistics for all farm labour, which were issued in June 1984, show little overall change since June 1983. We have had few reports of actual redundancies among dairy workers employed full-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the hon. Lady is entirely right—and I have no basis for either agreeing or disagreeing with her figures—the matter must be seen in perspective. There are about 22,000 full-time skilled dairy workers in England and Wales. Where redundancies occur, workers who meet the basic criteria for redundancy payments will have statutory protection under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), the Bill contains no compulsory requirement that more should be paid. But, as I have explained, it is not a Bill about redundancy payments. Analogies have been drawn with Denmark and the Netherlands, but in the Netherlands there is no provision for such payments. In this case, the Dutch Government felt that it was necessary to provide some equivalent for the statutory protection that we already have in Britain, and I believe that the same applies in Denmark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Redundancy normally relates to restructuring in an industry, but the redundancies resulting from the quota system follow a particular political act. I feel, therefore, that some special compensation should have been written in for farm workers, as it was for steel workers and others who faced a similar plight. I do not think that the redundancy argument holds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that 250 is only a small number of workers, but the total labour force in agriculture is now quite small. If someone is unemployed, he is unemployed full-time, and that applies to one worker or to 250. I cannot imagine that it will be very easy for those 250 workers to find any other employment in a rural area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who is made unemployed as a direct or indirect result of the introduction of quotas will be protected under the 1978 Act. That is comparable with the protection given to most other workers in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course—this will partly answer the hon. Member for Newham, South—it is always open to a farmer to pay more than the statutory payments if he wishes to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister ever known a farmer to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know several farmers who have been extremely generous to their employees, either on redundancy or on retirement, in very many ways, including providing accommodation for them and their wives until their death. It is dangerous to say that farmers do not treat their employees generously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could raise a number of points of detail on the amendment, but I have made the important ones. On the basis of those arguments, I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like this new definition of generosity on the part of farmers. It is apparently a generous act to refrain from evicting someone from their house on retirement or redundancy. I shall not pursue that point, but it illustrates very well the difference between our approach to employment matters and that of the Conservative party. 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard some intriguing ministerial gobble-degook on whether an outgoers scheme is a redundancy scheme. It stands to reason that if people come out of dairy production, there will be redundancies. As a direct consequence of the Bill, people will be made redundant. There is no getting away from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government's objective in their present scheme is to get about 2,000 small dairy farms out of dairy production. In 2,000 locations people will be put out of work. For many of them it will be difficult to find alternative enterprises or to create alternative employment. It was revealing to hear what the Minister thought of as one possible alternative source of employment. Perhaps he expects those 2,000 small dairy farms to be set up as safari parks or caravan sites. I do not know what the local planning authorities would think about that. It says a lot about the new Conservative view of the future for small farmers in the British countryside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman trying to say that the terms of redundancy for an agricultural worker who loses his job ought to be different from—perhaps higher than—the terms available to a shop worker who loses his?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing a Government decision to restructure an industry, which will involve making people redundant. It is not simply a matter of market forces. It is a decision by the Government to intervene in the economy—
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
although, heaven knows, we should welcome such an intervention. On the few occasions when the Government intervene in the economy, they tend to make a mess of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a Government intervene in the economy in a way which is likely to restructure an industry and make people redundant, there should be provisions to assist those people to find alternative employment— either in the area where they are working already or, if necessary, in an alternative area. That has been done before in the steel and coal industries. Why can it not be done for people who are made redundant in the dairy industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of his deep sympathy for all those who will be affected by the scheme. Apparently there is sympathy all around, but the only people who will get any money out of the scheme are the farmers who come out of milk production. There will be not a penny piece in compensation for the loss of jobs directly included in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talks about agonising decisions. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food told us on Second Reading that it had been terribly difficult for him to extract £50 million from the Treasury, even to set up this miserable scheme. Evidently, it would have been too much for him to go back and say that he wanted something for the workers. No doubt that was agonising, but it simply will not do. The outgoers scheme is in effect a redundancy scheme. A responsible Government would recognise that and make funds available in an appropriate manner, as the present Government and other Governments have done for other industries which may have had a little more political clout for the people employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak as a practical farmer. If I have to decide to make a shepherd or a dairyman redundant, is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that I should give preferential treatment to the dairy worker under the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am also a practical farmer. When I replied to the intervention from the hon. Member for Dorset, North, I said that there was a distinction between what happens in the day-to-day management of an individual farm and what is happening under the provisions of this scheme. This is a state-sponsored scheme to re-structure an industry which is directly designed to take people out of employment and to take cows out of production. There is an important distinction between that situation and the type of situation described by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Torney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that what the hon. Gentleman means is that if the worker is out of work because of this move there is a very clear difference between him and the industrial worker in steel, coal or anything else who is put out of work because there is no market for his product? Factories close because they cannot find a market for their products. But in this case, there is a market in this country for the product. All right, there is a surplus over the water, but there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
is a market in this country for the product, be it milk, butter, cream or any other allied product. But although there is a market, the Government intend to close down the production of that product. That is very different from the case of the industrial worker who is put off work because the market for his product is disappearing. It is a political act. There is a real difference, and my hon. Friend should be prepared to admit that there should be a difference in payment for being pushed out of work, because the context is completely different from what is understood as redundancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before calling the hon. Gentleman to resume his speech, may I appeal to those who want to make interventions to make them as short as possible and not to make them into speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an extremely helpful intervention from my hon. Friend, who knows a great deal about this industry, since he is sponsored by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, which has a number of members in the industry. I think that I had already made the point that he was reinforcing. We do feel that there is an obvious distinction between what happens in the natural course of the running of a business and what happens when the state intervenes in order to cut down the scale of an industry. What I feel particularly strongly about is that, as distinct from other industries where there may be a strong trade union which is in a position to negotiate special terms, either with individual employers or with the state, we are talking here about a large number of small employers and a relatively small number of people who are about to lose their jobs, and who will find it very difficult to look after themselves. I am convinced that that is the one and only reason why the Minister is not responding to the point, which is, frankly, just as reasonable as the last point, on which he conceded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I urge my hon. Friends and anybody else who is concerned about people in rural Britain being made redundant by the outgoers scheme to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>" a part of Great Britain ".</p></blockquote>
It harks back to the Treaty of Union in 1707—with which I know you will be familiar, Mr. Lamond— when certain Scottish lords sold their Parliament for English gold and were prepared to allow Scotland to be described from then on as north Britain. Since then a more enlightened view of the nations which form the United Kingdom has evolved, and generally, Scotland and Wales are called Scotland and Wales rather than parts of Great Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells)—he can make a speech later if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the drafting of the amendment at all. The Opposition do not feel very strongly about the matter, but it would be nice to hear the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering what the purpose of the amendment was, and I now understand that it is a probing amendment. I have some sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's remarks about style. I remind him that, like Mr. Lamond, I come from north of the border, and I knew immediately what he would say when he mentioned style. But he will realise that others who feel strongly about being separated out sometimes—people in the Duchy of Cornwall, for example—are also covered under " part".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that if amendment No. 6 is accepted, future schemes will have to cover either England, Scotland or Wales, but their conditions could not apply to specific areas within one of those countries. Therefore, as I think the hon. Gentleman will understand, the Bill as currently phrased seeks to allow for any future schemes the flexibility in this area which his first amendment sought in a different area, so that it might be possible to introduce a localised scheme, or even to change the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking entirely hypothetically, but I shall give an example. It might be desirable in future to introduce schemes operating in a relatively small area—in an area with large producers, for example —to buy up quota for reallocation in a different part of Great Britain. That is simply to retain the flexibility which would enable us to introduce a rather more localised scheme if we wished to do so. I stress again that we have no intention of doing that, or of making such changes. However, I think that it would be wise to eliminate the need for further legislation by including that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear that this was intended as a probing amendment. The Minister has explained why he wants to retain some flexibility, and we welcome that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 14, leave out paragraph (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have grave doubts about the Minister's judgment on several matters, including what he may or may not consider fit in the future. Obviously, this amendment, too, is designed as a probing amendment, but I think that the Minister should tell us what incidental and supplemental provisions he has in mind. We should like to suggest one or two which he might care to consider. If he were to reply in the affirmative to some of our suggestions, we might be more enthusiastic about the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, will more money be made available under the scheme to enable the Department to buy in more quota for redistribution? The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Mr. Lennox-Boyd) shakes his head. Clearly he is even closer to the Treasury than the Minister, and knows that there will be no money going. Many of us feel, however, that the scheme should receive additional funds to extend its scope because of the need to redistribute more quota in a more appropriate manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also suggest that provisions should be made in a future scheme to help outgoers to change the use of their land—to make this a positive rather than a negative scheme. At present it is entirely designed to take land out of milk production. Some of us feel that it would be more appropriate to draw up a scheme specifically and positively encouraging people to take up some alternative form of husbandry, which would regenerate employment and develop alternative forms of land use in affected areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, several hon. Members mentioned the interest of landlords in moneys paid out under the scheme. We have read with some concern of instances in which landlords have raked off a proportion of the money paid out under the outgoers scheme in return for their signatures giving consent for their tenants to come out of milk production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Hon. Members on both sides of the House regard that as an abuse. Although it has been overcome in Scotland, it is obviously continuing in parts of England—I do not know about Wales—and should be prevented by provisions in future schemes, and preferably in the present scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could list several other provisions which ought to be inserted. However, perhaps the Minister will now tell us what he has in mind, and comment on the instances that I have given so far. If his reply is as satisfactory as the one that he gave in our first debate, we may consider withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although this is a probing amendment, perhaps this is an opportune time for the Minister to say whether he will introduce provisions in future to ensure that money received under the outgoers scheme is tax free. It is more than likely that the system will have to be changed. Those people will have sold their dairy herd for the total sum of approximately £1,000, made up of £650 from the outgoers scheme and, on average, about £350 per cow. They will then have to re-invest the money in the business, so I wonder whether such income will be exempted from taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point to be made is that the amendment is concerned with the part of the Bill which relates to future schemes, not the existing scheme. No changes to the existing scheme could come under the provisions of this part of the Bill. The terms and conditions of the existing scheme have been set and we do not intend to make changes to them. Such changes would be retrospective, and that would be an unwise thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells) that the taxation arrangements under the existing outgoers scheme are extremely favourable and compare well with tax arrangements for any other schemes with a remotely comparable objective. Producers; can operate under the existing scheme in the knowledge that the tax arrangements will not change and are very favourable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking to the future, as the amendment does, I cannot comment on how a future scheme would look because we do not intend to introduce one; therefore, it is a hypothetical question. What I can do is tell the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) why the clause is in the Bill and show what we have in mind if any future Government wished to make use of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill there are two provisions allowing the Minister to specify the various provisions, conditions and requirements to be contained in any scheme: clause l(4)(a) and clause 1(6)(a). Clause 1(4)(a) is the more important of the two provisions because it deals with the conditions on which payments may be made to producers. Clause l(6)(a) covers less important but still necessary matters. What we have in mind under clause l(6)(a) would be the way in which details of the scheme such as deadlines were to be publicised or the provision for service of documents or details to be included in forms. The aim is to cover such procedural points which are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
sufficiently important to count as requirements or conditions as provided for under clause 1(5). We feel, therefore, that there is a need for the paragraph, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that explanation and agree that it should not be deleted. Of course, if there were ever to be a future scheme, it would always be subject to further debate in the House, and the details could then be probed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that point under the next amendment. I had suspicions when I first read the Bill that this was a little catch-all paragraph which was always included by parliamentary draftsmen in such Bills, and in the light of the Minister's reply. I suspect that I was right. Nevertheless, I accept that there could be a need for " incidental and supplemental provisions " to be included in such a scheme and in the light of our earlier debate, I sincerely hope that there will be a new scheme before long because this one seems to be extremely unsatisfactory in several of the respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in clause 1, page 2, line 16, leave out from " annulment" to " House " in line 17, and insert
	<br><blockquote><p> " affirmative resolution by the Commons ".</p></blockquote>
I have made it clear enough that we do not think much of the scheme as it stands. It follows that many of us would like better scope for parliamentary debate on any future scheme. As I have already said, it is clear that the scheme will have to be extended and improved, perhaps in the not so distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The negative resolution procedure set out in the Bill would simply enable the Minister to come to Parliament again with a fait accompli, and tell us that we can take it or leave it, warts and all. That is one of the shortcoming of the procedure for dealing with statutory instruments. We all know from experience on Wednesday mornings that the procedure of praying against such motions is pretty unsatisfactory. It puts those who would like to improve a scheme in a virtually impossible position because all they can do is reject it out of hand or endorse it; there is no way of amending it. Many of us feel that in some instances the whole procedure has turned into an abuse of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the stage where we could do with the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), who attempted to join the Committee this morning to give us the benefit of his thoughts. He referred to this subject on Second Reading, suggesting— and most reasonable people would agree with him —that a draft of such a scheme should be laid before Parliament to enable widespread consultation, not only with hon. Members, but with people interested in the industry that is affected so that they can have their say about the rights and wrongs of the schemes and suggest amendments. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
whole thing could be agreed between everybody concerned, and then the Government could put the scheme before the House under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the objective of the amendment. It seems reasonable, and I hope that the Minister will be as forthcoming as he was on the first amendment that we debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made two points. First, he said that using statutory instruments meant that there was a fait accompli and no opportunity to amend them because of the procedure of the House. That point was made by some of my hon. Friends and others during the debate on Second Reading, but it would be wrong to bind any future Government—even if that were possible—as to the precise form in which they should introduce another scheme, if there ever were one. He will know that, in introducing the original milk quota regulations, we quite deliberately had two bites at the cherry in that we had a full day's debate to enable the House to comment on the draft proposals before we introduced the statutory instrument itself. We considerably changed the regulations in the interim to meet all the points that had been made in the House. We did that because my right hon. Friend the Minister and I both felt that this was a major issue involving a tremendous number of details and that it was not only right but very valuable to have the views of the House before we came to the final regulations.

A future Government may take that view if there is ever another complex scheme. On the other hand, it may be a very simple scheme, and it may be felt that it would be simpler from the point of view of parliamentary time and the desirability to get the scheme on the statute book to lay it before the House in its final form. So I think that that should be left open. However, the views of my hon. Friends and hon. Members who are closely interested in the subject are now on the record in the Second Reading debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave the amendment considerable thought, and hope that I shall be able to satisfy the hon. Gentleman in not accepting it. The negative resolution procedure is the standard form for statutory instruments. The affirmative resolution procedure is mainly used for instruments which place financial burdens on individuals or make changes to primary legislation such as certain orders under the European Communities Act 1972. The normal form is the negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We felt that the normal form was more appropriate in this case not only because it is usual and follows precedents but because any order made under the Bill will not affect any individual who does not voluntarily undertake to abide by the conditions of a statutory scheme.

As the Committee knows, it will still be open to the House to debate the matter if an instrument is introduced in the manner described in the Bill as it stands, if the Opposition are alert to it, as I am sure they would be. It therefore seems better to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Colin Shepherd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hereford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was one of those who pressed on Second Reading for a draft regulation approach here. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has always sought to achieve the greatest level of consensus within the industry. Although in this instance it is a part of the industry that is coming and, indeed, is under regulation, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what sort of consultation he envisages having with the industry before developing regulations. The worries that are endemic in the industry at present could thus be pre-empted. A statutory instrument debate might be of a congratulatory nature rather than one of frustration and reprobation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different point from whether one chooses the negative or affirmative procedure for any future statutory instrument However, my hon. Friend will know of the considerable lengths to which my right hon. Friend and I went, not only to enable the House to debate our draft proposals but to consult with the industry very widely before we even produced the draft proposals. That shows our intent and the way in which we approach these matters. I am sure that the final proposals in the quota regulations were very much better because of that wide consultation and not only our willingness but our determination and eagerness to listen to view of the many experts in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister almost got himself into trouble when he suggested that the affirmative resolution procedure is most appropriate in cases where a financial burden is being imposed on individuals. On any analysis, the scheme imposes pretty severe financial burdens on several individuals, not least the employees whom we were discussing earlier. We all know about ministerial and departmental consultation. The Minister said that a tremendous number of details had been drawn to his attention and, true to form, he ignored most of them. There was an example of that only today. One of the points that was drawn to his attention earlier was the need for flexibility and the desirability of allowing people to take advantage of the scheme even if they only partially come out of milk production as opposed to abandoning it completely. He acknowledged only today that there is something to be said for that point. I assure the Minister that the official Opposition will be alert to those matters and look forward to praying against practically anything he ever tables in future.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorely tempted to have another Second Reading debate now but I am not sure that I would make many friends if I did so. Clause 1 is the key clause to the Bill. It covers the payments to farmers ceasing milk produc-
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
tion and provides for the manner in which future schemes should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been made fairly clear in Committee and on Second Reading that the current scheme has very few friends. There is widespread support for the principle of compensating people who stop producing milk as a consequence of the quota scheme, but there is a lot of scepticism about the details of the current scheme. We have heard about some of those objections from both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Practically everyone thinks that the existing scheme is inadequate—even the National Farmers Union, which is not renowned for attacking the Government, has made some pretty severe strictures. It says that the scheme is inadequate, that additional funds are needed, and that more quota needs to be redistributed urgently, to smaller producers in particular, if they are to continue producing milk. Nothing has been done for the employees who will be made redundant by the scheme, and there is no positive initiative to help those involved in cutbacks under the quota scheme to set up alternative forms of husbandry in order to safeguard employment, the countryside and the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I described the scheme as cheap and nasty, and nothing that the Minister said today has caused me to review that assessment. Because the Committee has failed to amend the scheme, particularly in respect of employees, I feel that we should vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would obviously be inappropriate for me to go over all the ground in the outgoers scheme again; we have often debated it in the past. However, I am bound to say that the words " cheap and nasty" do not run very well together. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the scheme should be extended and that much more money should be spent on it, I cannot understand why he describes it as nasty. It is because it is not a nasty scheme, but a very helpful one for the restructuring of the industry, that it has been welcomed so widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment on one point which the hon. Gentleman raised, as I think that it may be helpful. He talked about the urgent need to redistribute more quota. We accept, of course, that there is an urgent need to get the whole matter settled, which is why the United Kingdom was one of the first member states to introduce an outgoers scheme and moved with the most appropriate speed possible. As I explained before, the difficulty on the one hand is to give every producer an opportunity to have his case fairly heard, and on the other hand to bring in all the final quota as quickly as possible so that it may be reallocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It now looks very likely that Great Britain— England and Wales, certainly—will not need to pay any supplementary levy by the end of March. It will take the pressure off this year, if that is the case. Because it inevitably took time to introduce the outgoers scheme, it was not possible to have it in place, the money awning in and quota being released earlier than in the past few weeks. Therefore, there is not much quota to be redistributed this year, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
that is why it will be concentrated on cases of exceptional hardship. What I said about not paying supplementary levy will obviously help the small producers, who will get the full benefit of the out-goers scheme next year. That is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will support clause 1, because I believe that it will benefit the industry greatly. In saying that, I draw attention to a point made by the hon. Member for East Lothian in his concluding remarks on amendment No. 9. He will recall that the Bill does not provide any time scale for the introduction of a further scheme, if there ever were one, and until the Bill is repealed, that possibility would be indefinite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to hear him say that the Labour Opposition would on every future occasion make sure that they noticed what happened under any future scheme. I am sure that we all noted with great care his assumption that it will always be a Labour Opposition. I was careful not to specify a Labour Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful for dairy farmers, wherever they live, to know whether the Minister believes that enough dairy producers will opt for the outgoers scheme to ensure that those remaining in the industry during the next five years will be catered for.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have introduced each tranche of opportunities for producers to take advantage of the outgoers scheme, all the signs have been that we shall be able to fulfil the quota of 289 million litres in England and Wales, which will enable us to meet our objectives under the scheme.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister expect to happen under clause 2? It would be interesting to know what provisions he is making for
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the supervision and enforcement of the scheme. I have a vision of the legendary man from the Ministry, wearing his bowler hat or otherwise, hiding behind a tree trying to catch an outgoer in the act of milking a cow, and taking enforcement action as a consequence of that flagrant infringement of the scheme. Perhaps that reveals its absurdity to some extent. Are similar provisions being made in the other member states of the European Community? Is the French Ministry of Agriculture, for instance, making elaborate plans to catch up on individual farmers who might try to carry on a bit of dairy production on the side, having taken advantage of the scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, an outgoer will be prevented from ever becoming involved in milk production again. Will that apply to his successor—for instance, a son or daughter—or only to the individual to whom the payment is made? I have another question which brings us back to flexibility. Suppose that an outgoer who had received payment under the scheme subsequently changed his mind and wanted to go back into milk production, and suppose that—quite legitimately—he acquired another farm which had a quota attached to it. Would he still be prevented from going back into milk production? The Minister would then be taking the quota out of circulation twice, once in respect of the outgoers scheme and again in respect of the farm subsequently acquired by the outgoer. The position is potentially anomalous, and it would be helpful if the Minister said something about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 provides the powers of entry and inspection of records so that authorised officers can make checks to ensure that milk producers who have received the outgoers payment have not returned to milk production. Article 4 of the Council regulation requires that producers who receive compensation and discontinue milk production must discontinue it definitively. We have already debated that, and the condition is built into our existing non-statutory scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two separate powers are needed to enforce that condition. An outgoer may become involved in milk production either directly as a producer or indirectly as a person with a substantial financial interest in a milk-producing business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two powers that are required are first, as clause 2 provides, a power of entry on to land to establish whether an outgoer is directly involved in milk production. Secondly, the power to inspect records is provided to establish from business records, accounts and other relevant papers whether an outgoer has a substantial financial interest in a milk-producing business. We are required to have those powers to be able to enforce the conditions under the Community regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about other member states. If any evidence comes to light that other member states are not enforcing the regulation in the way that we intend to, we shall expect the Commission to take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Commission take active steps to monitor such enforcement measures in other countries? It is often left to individuals in the industries concerned to seek evidence in other countries, which is very difficult. Will the Government take active measures in that respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult subject, because there are so many regulations that it is not possible to put our hands on our hearts and say that they are being properly enforced in every way. But I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are alert to both unfair competition through state subsidies not permitted within Community rules, and evasion or avoidance wherever we can detect it. That applies not only to dairy production but to many other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be extremely important to apply all the milk quota regulations fairly across the Community. We have made that point at almost every Council meeting since the regulations were introduced. It is partly because we are not satisfied on that point that we are still not paying the supplementary levy due from Northern Ireland. We are anxious to ensure that that is done, and I am sure that the Commission will be equally anxious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Torney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that there is no effective method of policing within the Common Market? That has been established by our Select Committee in Brussels, of which I am a member. To find out whether a member state is adhering to the rules properly, the Committee relies on newspapers and so on. Will the Minister undertake to press for an effective method of monitoring to be introduced in the Common Market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have been extremely alert to that problem. I hope that I shall not be out of order if I refer briefly to the fishing industry. It is largely as a result of our initiatives that we now have an inspectorate, which is Commission-appointed, to oversee the way in which fishing inspection is carried out in member states. It has already had a considerable impact in its first year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman wil accept that, although it is not possible to give any cast-iron guarantees, we frequently pursue the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the Minister's difficulty in giving cast-iron guarantees. Let me give another parallel. The management of a factory in my constituency felt that it was suffering from unfair competition under Community rules. The people who operated that factory had to send someone to Brussels to snoop around and find out what was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, it will be impossible for farmer Evans in Carmarthen to go snooping around France to try to find out what is going on—although such a trip might be fun. Will the Minister's Department be actively involved in monitoring what is happening in other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the difficulties because I have been involved in such issues. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my right hon. Friend and I attach particular importance to monitoring. We therefore try to connect, assess and pursue evidence wherever we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about sons and daughters. The provision will not apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third point was about a producer wishing to go back into production himself by buying a farm with a quota. He would not be able to do so and operate his quota. If he went into milk production in that situation he would have to face the consequences of a possible super levy. He would not have a quota because he has to give up quota indefinitely until the end of the quota system if he takes advantage of the outgoers scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly believe that this is right. One of the biggest criticisms that I have heard of the previous scheme to encourage producers to get out of production—one which I share— is that there was only a five-year time limit during which they got substantial public funds in compensation for coming out of milk, and at the end of that five years they were able to come back in again and thus add to the increased milk production problem that we have faced, which was responsible for the introduction of the quota system in the first place. It has to be said that that previous scheme did not work because it did not halt the ever-increasing rise in milk production and it led to that—in my view—unfortunate consequence that I have described. What the present scheme does is prevent that happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel as strongly as the Minister about the need to prevent abuse. We have had a ridiculous situation in the past, when people have been actively encouraged with subsidies to come out of milk production and almost simultaneously have been encouraged with other subsidies, almost from the same sources, to go back into milk production, which is ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation which I sought to describe was where a farmer, for perfectly good reasons, decides to take his present holding out of milk production and to take advantage of the outgoers scheme. In five or 10 years, circumstances of individuals can change, and that same farmer might acquire a different holding altogether which might have quota attached to it. Would he then be prevented from going back into milk production in such circumstances, and if so, what justification is there for requiring the man to come out of farming twice over? Has the individual to sign away his right ever to milk a cow again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He must certainly sign away his right to quota. He must come out of milk production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But what about new quota?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he was simply able to buy a farm with new quota—quota existing on the farm but to him new quota—he would then be going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
back into milk production, so he would be getting quite close to the problem of the previous scheme that we have already agreed between us that we want to prevent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Gentleman was also concerned about the problem that the quota might then be frozen and not used. As he knows, there is a provision under the Community regulations to enable —in our case—the Milk Marketing Board to take up quota that is not being used and re-allocate it in future years. We have deliberately decided not to make use of that provision this year because it is a transitional year and it would have been hugely unfair to take away from producers some quota they did not use this year when they were adjusting to the quota system. But we have that possibility and in future years we shall have to think about how we make use of it. This may be one area where we could make use of it. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing that point up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I invite the Minister to make some brief comments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say quickly what the purpose of the clause is while I catch my breath in order to catch up with the hon. Gentleman's point. I had hoped that the notes on clauses had dealt with most of the problems about clause 3. Clause 3 makes it an offence, as we have to do, for any person to make a false statement in order to obtain or retain payments provided for in clause 1. It will also be an offence to obstruct an authorised officer exercising the powers in clause 2 which we have just discussed. The penalty will be a fine on summary conviction not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, which currently stands at £2,000 and is broadly in line with existing practice. That is the purpose of the clause. The point that the hon. Gentleman raised about noncompliance applies only when a producer is found not to have complied. It is a somewhat technical legal point. It might be better if I wrote to the hon. Gentleman on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here is our big oppor-unity to talk about the financial provision for the Bill. Neither the clause nor the money resolution specifically restricts the funds that can be made available under the scheme. The scheme must be seen in the context of the £50 million which the Minister of Agriculture claims to have extracted with such difficulty from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Indeed, he gave us an interesting insight on Second Reading into the negotiations between Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he said that he had great difficulty in getting that sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost everyone who is concerned about the industry considers the scheme inadequate and feels that there is an urgent need to release additional quota for redistribution to those who are going to remain in milk production. There is already an example in Scotland, where the assessment of claims for secondary quota have already been finalised— those who have been allocated additional quota by the tribunals will get less than two-thirds of what the tribunals reckon they ought to receive. It follows that producers will continue to face severe difficulties, even after the distribution of secondary quota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point has been made very clearly by all the unions, the National Farmers Union of England and Wales, the Farmers Union of Wales and the National Farmers Union of Scotland. The NFU in England and Wales suggested that there is a need to increase the scale of the scheme by about 50 per cent. to raise the figure to £75 million. That is a substantial amount but not all that substantial in the context of the Government's spending in other areas. It is certainly not an unreasonable sum to request for an important industry like this, which is not only important in terms of food production but is of massive importance to the economy of the dairy farming areas of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is causing havoc in some parts of the country, particularly in Wales, the west country and the west of Scotland. Everyone who has commented on it seriously regards the current funding as inadequate. It would be wrong if we did not take this opportunity to press the Minister to go back to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on hands and knees if necessary, to try to get some additional funding. The Opposition feel that an additional £25 million, spread over five years, is not an unreasonable sum to request to try to set the industry right. That is the figure suggested by the NFU. The Farmers Union of Wales has asked for a substantially higher figure. It is impossible for me, with my back-up, to quote a specific figure as the right one. However, it is abundantly clear that the present figure of £50 million over five years is inadequate, even to serve the purposes for which it was designed.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0924">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
I feel strongly about this matter. I hope that other members of the Committee will take the opportunity to appeal for additional funding for the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has just said, and I agree with the sentiments he expressed. However, if I understood the Minister correctly at the beginning of the debate, he assured the Committee that he was satisfied that there would be enough quota to ensure that a dairy industry would be viable. If I understood him correctly, he said that £50 million was ample to cover the out-goers scheme. However, having listened to many people throughout the land talk about the scheme and its problems, I believe that we should not be too specific about how much extra money is needed. We should leave the amount open-ended, and say that we provisonally want between £50 million and £100 million which would give the Minister plenty of scope in future to ensure that he can cater for the needs of the dairy farmers who will participate in the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That last point was debated at some length on Second Reading. The hon. Gentleman has really made two points. First, he drew attention to the urgent need for the redistribution of quota, and 1 have already dealt with that; I said that I agreed with him and that we are proceeding with it quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the queston of the sums of money available, I must make clear that the main objective of the outgoers scheme by far is to help small producers to get back to their 1983 quota levels and to deal with the cases of exceptional hardship. It was not to give payments to all and sundry who wished to give up milk production. As I said, all the indications are that, having acquired the money, we have pitched the payments at the right level to provide sufficient incentive to release enough quota to meet our targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has to be said that there are limits to the extent of spending other taxpayers' money on the dairy industry, and we feel that £50 million is not only a reasonable amount but compares well with what is being done in other countries. It is important to remember that it is not just £50 million which comes from United Kingdom taxpayers to help the United Kingdom dairy industry; on top of that, hundreds of millions of pounds in Government support through the whole Community support system is being spent to help the United Kingdom dairy industry. There is very substantial financial support for the dairy industry, and I cannot promise that the Government will extend the outgoers scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Minister to comment on the situation in Scotland, where the secondary quota distribution has been finalised We all know about the elaborate machinery set up by the Ministry for assessing special need and so on, but the assessment has now been completed in Scotland. The tribunals—which, incidentally, were
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
overseen by Mr. David Myles, former hon. Member for Banff—heard all the special cases and told the individual producers involved what on objective grounds they thought would be the appropriate additional quota to allocate to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When all the amounts are totted up, we find that the producers in those categories have been subjected to a reduction of 42·5 per cent. in the amount of additional quota which the tribunals thought would be appropriate, and we understand that something similar will happen in England and Wales. So there is not enough additional quota for redistribution in such cases, even if there may be enough to bring the production levels of small producers up to what they were in 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, will the Minister accept that everything in the garden is not lovely, that there are problems, and that there really is a case for additional funding and extending the scope of the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister one question to clarify a matter which has been raised many times by many dairy farmers. If a dairy farmer with a 50-cow herd accepts the outgoers scheme, he will get £650 per cow. As I said earlier, on the law of averages he would sell his dairy herd for between £350 and £400 per cow. That would be £50,000 for a 50-cow herd on average 70 or 80-acre farm. What would that farm be worth to the farmer after accepting the outgoers scheme. Whether or not to accept the scheme is a very important decision to make, and many farmers have accepted it without realising that the value of their farm will drop by 40 to 50 per cent., as is well known in Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire. The Ministry should advise farmers that if they accept the outgoers scheme the value of their smallholding will drop by 40 to 50 per cent. in the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reflected on that last point he would realise that I could not possibly give him a firm answer, even if I were qualified to do so, as the conditions will vary so enormously from farm to farm. I am sure that every producer who has taken advantage of the outgoers scheme has, on his own or with advice weighed up all the problems and decided what he will do when he has given up dairying, before firmly accepting the offer. The advice of the agricultural development advisory service and others is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will know that he is talking about secondary quotas for expanding cases and that they come primarily from the allocation that we have made of just over 2½ per cent. That is not from the outgoers scheme, but from the fact that our primary quota allocation to each producer was 9 per cent. The expanders come in the range from just over 6 per cent. to 9 per cent. That is where that quota comes from and it is permitted under the regulations. We made it clear from the outset that if there were an enormous number of applications for expanders, and the evidence adduced by the panels and tribunals justified it, we might find that the final allocations made by the panels and tribunals were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
greater than the quota between the roughly 6¼ per cent. and 9 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we had made more provision for the expanders, we should have found that those producers who had not expanded, but heeded the warnings of the past few years of the dangers of ever-expanding milk production, would have had their own primary quota cut even more. I think that they would have felt that to be extremely unfair. They would have been further penalised to help those who had expanded and helped to create the problem. We had to balance the interests as best we could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Roger Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how this particularly neat, round figure of £50 million over five years was reached? We are all aware that, when the quota scheme was introduced, it came as a bolt from the blue and caused great confusion. Eventually it was decided that the way to mitigate the severe and devastating blow to the farming industry was to provide an outgoers scheme. It was thought that small farmers would be hardest hit and an arbitrary figure of a family farm with 40 cows was chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the small farmers have realised that their way out may be to accept the outgoers scheme. But many other farmers on marginal land with perhaps more than 40 cows are finding themselves in great difficulty. Even though the National Farmers Union welcomed the Bill and the £50 million, it pressed for necessary funding to allow the extension of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were two estimates this morning. One was for an increase of 50 per cent. to give £25 million more. Four times the original allocation has also been suggested if we are to do the farming community justice. The figure of £200 million may be arbitrary, but is not the Government's £50 million figure equally arbitrary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we had to strike a balance between what it was fair to ask other taxpayers to pay and what we could do to help the dairy industry. We had to bear in mind that substantial sums are being paid by the taxpayer in other directions to support the dairy industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, one always has to draw the line somewhere and, given that most people agree that it is the small producer who wants to stay in business and who has no other viable farming opportunities who is most hard hit, we thought it right to draw
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
the line at that small producer. The £50 million was calculated to enable him to get back to his 1983 production levels and also to deal with the exceptional hardship cases which, following the debate in the House on the draft regulations, we included in the final regulations. I hope that we shall have achieved that with the £50 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clauses 5 to 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacGregor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the beginning that I hoped we would give thorough but speedy consideration of the Bill, and I think that we have achieved my hope. It has not been the lengthiest or the most difficult Committee to serve on, but I am sure that I speak for all members of the Committee in thanking, you, Mr. Lamond, for the skilful, tolerant and genial way in which you have presided over our proceedings, which has enabled us to achieve that objective. In thanking you, I should like to thank all the others on the staff side associated with the carrying through of the Committee proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one would expect us to have quite as much enthusiasm for the Bill as the Minister himself. We are grateful for the one small mercy and the one fairly substantial concession which he was prepared to accept. We still have severe misgivings about the shortcomings of the Bill, but we all wish the dairy industry well. I should like to add my thanks to those which have been expressed by the Minister to you, Mr. Lamond, for the characteristically congenial way in which you have conducted our affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I express the same sentiments as the other hon. Gentlemen and thank you, Mr. Lamond, and all the staff? I thank the Minister for conceding to some of our requests today. In Welsh I say " Diolch yh fawr."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members very much for their co-operation this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
