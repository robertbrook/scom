<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 255, in page 178, leave out line 45.<br><br>
This is another probing amendment which would delete the reference to a charter of resignation. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would explain the meaning of the heading and tell us the cost of abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked for an explanation of the heading "Charter of resignation". This is an old Scottish duty relating to four separate forms of charter in Scotland which used to be charged at 5 shillings. Changes in Scottish law have made this head obsolete; therefore there is no cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 256, in page 179, leave out lines 1 and 2.<br><br>
The heading of this amendment refers to a covenant and elaborates by describing it as
<br><blockquote><p>"Covenant. Any separate deed of covenant."</p></blockquote>
I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the meaning of the heading and tell us the cost of abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the heading,
<br><blockquote><p>"Covenant. Any separate deed of covenant"</p></blockquote>
relates to a duty of 50p maximum which was chargeable on separate deeds relating to the transfer or production of title which are not liable to ad valorem duty. In practice, no such deeds ever arise, so it has no cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 257, in page 179, leave out lines 3 and 4.<br><br>
This heading refers to a deed of any kind not described in the schedule. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would explain the reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"Deeds of any kind whatsoever, not described in this Schedule"</p></blockquote>
and say whether there is a cost involved in its abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is yet another fair question from the hon. Gentleman. As he said, his amendment relates to the entry
<br><blockquote><p>"Deed of any kind whatsoever not described in this Schedule",</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
which is a sort of sweep-up heading that, in theory, would charge any number of agreements and other documents under seal. In the 19th century it was charged with a higher rate—£1.75—although the current nominal rate is 50p. It used to apply to all sorts of documents, but it is now redundant and obsolete, and nowadays no one would be inclined to take deeds of any kind not described in a schedule along for stamping, because they would have no effect. It is therefore the removal of an obsolete provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What were the deeds that used to exist but no longer exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In theory, any agreement that was executed under seal. As that could relate to anything and everything, it would depend entirely upon whether those who executed the document brought it along to be stamped. I cannot say what the range or scope would be potentially. As all the material agreements are covered by other heads, there is no need for a general charge of that kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about what transactions were being stamped on numerous occasions some years ago, which I think is what the Economic Secretary told us, and what has changed in the meantime. Is it that people are neglecting to bring those deeds forward to be stamped or that deeds are not being made? What has changed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision is no longer needed because documents of that kind do not need to be stamped as a normal practice. If a stamp is needed, it will have to apply, but it serves no practical purpose, unlike those on property and so on, and there seems to be no point in retaining it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now I understand the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 179, leave out lines 5 and 6.<br><br>
These headings refer to
<br><blockquote><p>"Letter of allotment and letter of renunciation"</p></blockquote>
And "Scrip certificate, scrip."<br><br>
Again, I ask the Economic Secretary to explain the meaning of those phrases and to tell us whether the Treasury has recently received any revenue from letters of allotment, letters of renunciation and scrip certificates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 258 relates to schedule 21(<i>f</i>), and the hon. Gentleman asked whether any revenue had recently been raised under the headings listed therein. The answer is that the duty was abolished in 1949. Therefore, there has been no revenue of that kind. At the same time, an exemption was given from two "sweep-up" heads, agreement and deed, under which such documents could have been chargeable. As long as either of those sweep-up heads was in force these two heads had to remain in force to define the exempt documents. The agreement head went in 1970, the deed head is going now. There is, therefore, no need to retain the exempt heads, and it has no financial cost.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 545</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 259, in page 179, leave out lines 7 and 8.<br><br>
This heading refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"Letters or power of attorney, and commission, factory, mandate."</p></blockquote>
I repeat the question which I have previously asked the Economic Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are five charges under this head, one for appointing or authorising a proxy vote at 5p; another by a seaman for receipt of wages at 5p; another for receipt of dividends at 5p to 25p; another for the receipt of any sum not exceeding £20 at 25p, and any other case at 50p. In practice, statutory exemptions have been given from the items under this head, and it serves no useful purpose.<br><br>
All those items are headings. They are not provisions but merely titles within the legislation under which charges could be considered. They do not have any specific application underneath.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was relieved to learn that all those who have arranged proxy votes in the recent past have not been avoiding their tax obligations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 179, leave out line 9.<br><br>
This heading is called, "Precept of clare constat". I repeat my previous question to the Economic Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Precept of clare constat" literally means "it clearly appears." It is a Scottish duty related to feudal land tenure. It used to be charged on a document granted by a superior in favour of an heir confirming that the heir was entitled to the land. Changes in Scottish law have made it obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell us which changes in Scottish law he has in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that there are no longer any charges under this heading but, if I cannot immediately give the hon. Gentleman an answer, I shall let him have the information later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a previous occasion, a Minister from the Department of Transport came before us. I do not suggest that someone from the Scottish Office appears on this occasion. I think, however, that my hon. Friends representing Scottish constituencies require a little more explanation. I quite understand if the Minister is unable to provide such information this evening. Perhaps he will write to me and to those hon. Gentleman who represent Scottish constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 261, in page 179, leave out line 10.<br><br>
Again, I repeat my question to the Economic Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 261 relates to the heading,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 546</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Procuration, deed, or other instrument of"</p></blockquote>
and a 50p duty. I hope that the hon. Member for Hodge Hill, will not ask me what is involved, because extensive research by the Revenue has not been able to discover what the head was meant to catch. However, we can safely say that in practice it has fallen into disuse and in the circumstances it seems sensible to abolish it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This obviously goes back several centuries, perhaps to before 1694, which was mentioned earlier. I could suggest a Treasury meaning of the word "procuration". I assume that it has something to do with procuring. Clearly, the Revenue has not been receiving any income from taxing procuration, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 262, in page 179, leave out lines 11 to 13.<br><br>
This heading attracted my attention and that of other members of the Committee because it refers to resignation and it continues with a definition or elaboration of the phrase by referring to
<br><blockquote><p>" 'instrument of resignation of any lands or other heritable subjects in Scotland not of burgage tenure'."</p></blockquote>
I know that my hon. Friends who represent Scottish constituencies are anxious to learn the answers to questions that I have asked the Minister on similar occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hodge Hill, has mentioned the head referred to in paragraph (<i>j</i>) of schedule 21. "Burgage tenure" was a form of feudal tenure peculiar to Scottish burghs where the vassals were strictly the burghers as a group and not individuals. Documents within the scope of this head are now described as dispositions. Since that head is being retained, this head is not needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary tell us when this stamp was introduced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an answer. Burgage was equated with the more common type of feudal tenure in 1874, although it is possible that some burgage holdings may survive. Burgage has a long history, but it does not operate now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 179, leave out lines 14 and 15.<br><br>
This heading refers to the
<br><blockquote><p>"Revocation of any use or trust or any property by any writing, not being a will."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will provide us with the information that I requested on similar amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The exemption under this heading applies only to the revocation of the use or trust of property. It does not extend to any accompanying transfer of the property, which is the point at which duty is paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about that explanation. Will the Economic Secretary explain further?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0826">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 547</span>
Presumably stamp duty has been levied in the past on revocation of uses and trusts by writing that is not included in a will. That stamp duty must have been charged in addition to a stamp duty on the transfer of the property, if I have understood the Economic Secretary's explanation correctly. What has changed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What has changed is that we do not consider this to be a useful duty. The substance of the dutiable event would be the transfer of the property and not the ending of a writ or any substance creating it. Its termination does not seem to us a sensible occasion to impose a 50p duty. The document that revoked the trust on property has until now been chargeable at 50p. We do not consider that that charge serves any useful purpose, and we think that it should be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This seems different from the previous headings, many of which have fallen into disuse over the centuries. What is the estimate of the revenue obtained from this minor stamp duty in the past?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely small. I do not have a more accurate figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least I have extracted from the Economic Secretary the amounts of tax cuts. We now have "extremely small" to add to our previous phrases, "negligible" "slight" and "low yield". I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 179, leave out lines 16 and 17.<br><br>
I suspect that I shall be told that this heading is similar to heading (<i>j</i>). It refers to "Seisin" and to a
<br><blockquote><p>"Notarial instrument to be expeded and recorded in any register of sasines".</p></blockquote>
I look foward to the Economic Secretary's explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision to which amendment No. 262 refers is an ancient Scottish duty, which has been made obsolete by changes in Scottish land law. The word "seisin" means putting into the possession of land. It formed part of the former machinery for completing the title of feudal vassals and has been obsolete for many years. Notices of title replaced notarial instruments in the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1964.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 265, in page 179, leave out line 18.<br><br>
The line that we seek to leave out refers to the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"Warrant of attorney of any other kind".</p></blockquote>
Again, I should appreciate an explanation from the Economic Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Warrants of attorney are a method of giving a creditor security by a debtor authorising a solicitor to confess judgment for an amount agreed to. I understand that the practice is now obsolete and the heading is no longer required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry David</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 548</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 266, in page 179, leave out line 19.<br><br>
The relevant line contains the heading beginning "Writ". Again, I ask for the Economic Secretary's explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The heading relates to writs of acknowledgement which were abolished by the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964. It is another duty that is obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schoolmarm in me is very tempted to ask the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) to repeat how much of this obscure debate he has remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first heading, Miss Fookes, I learnt a great deal. It is important to put such matters on the record. Clearly the headings should all be removed from statute and we shall support schedule 21. However, I hardly think that this minor sweeping up can be described as a great tax reform.</span></p>
<p><i>Schedule 21 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 80 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 81</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CERTIFICATES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 267, in page 80, line 37, leave out subsection (1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 231 to 233, and Government amendment No. 234.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was still digesting all the information that I obtained about schedule 21, so I did not rise in time to ask the Economic Secretary to explain the purport of clause 80. I do not seek to return to that clause, but the Economic Secretary might find time to explain it.<br><br>
I propose in the amendment the deletion of clause 81(1). It gives the commissioners power to make regulations providing that an instrument
<br><blockquote><p>"which is of a kind specified in them"</p></blockquote>
shall have a certain content. Will the Economic Secretary explain why he thinks the commissioners should be given such a power when subsection (2) gives the Treasury a similar if not identical power? The Opposition would much prefer the power to be given to the Treasury and exercised by people who are directly accountable to the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause does two things. The second is to exempt certain instruments from liability, and it is proper for the Treasury rather than the Revenue to do that. The first provision is administrative. It is designed to make the policing of sales duty more effective in the absence of the duty on gifts. Sales duty, which is sometimes referred to as transfer duty, relates to property, shares and so on.<br><br>
The clause provides for regulations to be made by the Inland Revenue requiring instruments which it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0827">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 549</span>
claimed are liable only to a fixed duty to be certified. The person signing the certificate would be required to state the ground on which it is claimed that a document is liable only to fixed duty—in other words to commit himself to the basis on which he claims that ad valorem duty is not required.<br><br>
The second part of the clause provides for regulations to be made by the Treasury for certain instruments to be exempted from liability for the fixed duties that will remain after the repeals in clause 79, which is attached to schedule 21. That would enable instruments which the Stamp Office need not see in order to police sales duty to bypass the Stamp Office. But as it is technically an exemption, it is proper for it to be granted by the Treasury, rather than by the Inland Revenue on the Treasury's behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary explain the Government amendments which are grouped with amendment No. 267?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I wanted to respond immediately to the hon. Gentleman's earlier question.<br><br>
After we had published the clause, representations were made to us that it contained a technical defect, because it requires the certificate which I described a moment ago to be contained in the instrument itself. That requirement is unduly restrictive, because a certificate might inadvertently be omitted from the instrument. If it was then impossible to re-execute the instrument in exactly the same form—for example, because the executor of the instrument had died in the meantime—the absence of the certificate would make the whole thing ineffective, because it could not be stamped.<br><br>
Secondly, the requirement for the instrument to contain a certificate may mean that only the person who executes the document can provide the document, although it may be perfectly proper for someone else to do so and to take responsibility for the duty. Generally, it would be more convenient for the parties if the solicitors provided the certificates, because they arrange the documentation of the whole transaction on behalf of their clients.<br><br>
In response to those representations, we introduced amendments Nos. 231 and 234, which taken collectively would relax that restrictive provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 268, which has been grouped with the Government amendments, would remove subsection (3), which appears to empower the commissioners and the Treasury to include in the regulations any provisions that they may think fit. That seems to me to be a very wide power, and I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would explain why it is needed.</span></p>
<p>9 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, subsection (3) states that regulations may contain
<br><blockquote><p>"such incidental or consequential provisions as the Commissioners or Treasury — think fit."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the subsection is to enable the Inland Revenue or the Treasury to include in regulations made under the power conferred on them by subsections (1) and (2) any provisions necessary to make the regulations effective that are not specifically covered by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
terms of those subsections. But although they will have administrative power to make such provisions, those provisions must be incidental to or consequential on the specific powers in subsections (1) or (2).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the clause result in a reduction in income to the Inland Revenue? If so, what will be the size of that reduction? Will the cost to the Revenue be greater or smaller than the cost of clause 80?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the clause will not cost anything because it is an administrative provision. The hon. Gentleman ingeniously raised the question of clause 80. That clause deals with contract notes chargeable at rates of between l0p and 60p on transfers of stock and shares which are already covered by ad valorem stamp duty. The small contract stamp duty is additional to the 1 per cent ordinary stamp duty on transfers. It is not necessary for administrative purposes, it is expensive to operate and it produces a very small yield. The cost to the Revenue of clause 80 will be £4 million, but that is the gross cost and it has to be remembered that, as with all stamp duties, the cost of operation is relatively high.<br><br>
In addition, there is a much higher cost to practitioners in the market who deal with contract notes, because they have to deal with them item by item whereas they generally account by agreement to the Revenue on a general basis. They have a contract to settle collectively. The compliance cost is high, but the administrative cost to brokers and other practitioners dealing in securities is considerable. The yield is small in relation to the stamp duty—the basic method by which the Government consider it proper to raise a charge on the transfer of stocks and shares.<br><br>
The impact of clause 81 is not on contract note duty, but on sales or transfer duty. The first of its two provisions is intended to provide for more effective policing of the duty, so that, if anything, it is likely to produce a yield rather than a cost, although, as it is an administrative provision, that is impossible to quantify.<br><br>
The second is to provide for regulations to be made so that instruments can be certified. Again that is an administrative arrangement, and the certification will not involve a change in yield one way or the other.</span></p>

EXCHANGE RATES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would explain what is involved in the clause, which appears to involve the abolition of stamp duty on certain instruments concerned with fixed exchange rates for foreign currency.<br><br>
What is the cost to the Revenue of the clause? Also, why is this provision to take effect at a different date from the other clauses in this part of the Bill? As we have progressed through the clauses, we have become familiar with the date 26 March 1985. Why are we now being asked to legislate for 1 August 1985?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 82 does not provide that duty shall not apply, but that
<br><blockquote><p>"Section 12 of the Finance Act 1899 … shall not apply".</p></blockquote>
I must explain to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) that the clause therefore has no cost; it is not a financial measure.<br><br>
Clause 82 makes a minor change in stamp duty law. It abolishes—from 1 August 1985—the fixed rates of exchange at which many currencies have to be converted into sterling for stamp duty purposes. From that date, all foreign currencies will be converted at the rate in operation at the time that the instrument was executed.<br><br>
Fixed rates may have been suitable when exchange rates were relatively stable. It is clearly unsatisfactory that people are now making fortuitous gains or losses on stamp duty simply because market rates have changed since the rate was last fixed. It is a simple proposal and helps to simplify stamp duty law.<br><br>
There are at present two different rules for converting foreign currency to sterling. With most currencies, the basic rules are provided by the Stamp Act 1891 and the conversion is at the rate applying on the date of the instrument. That will now apply to all transactions.<br><br>
One of the provisions of the Finance Act 1899 imposed a fixed rate of exchange for 21 foreign currencies which were in active use at the time. They do not, of course, coincide with the 21 currencies most actively used today.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hodge Hill asked why clause 82 is to take effect from 1 August. It was thought that that date would be convenient to those involved in currency trading, as it would allow a little notice of the change. The clause does not change the duty, only the way in which it is calculated. The number of cases affected by the clause is relatively small.<br><br>
The Finance Act 1899 imposed on the Board of Inland Revenue a duty to vary the rates. However, before the changes can be made, the proposed new rates must be advertised for two successive weeks in the <i>London Gazette.</i> With rapidly moving exchange rates the effect is that new rates can be virtually out of date by the time they are published. Therefore, we thought it sensible to make this change.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the purpose of the clause and what, if anything, is the cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause opens the way to a procedural change which will speed up house purchase formalities for buyers of property below the £30,000 stamp duty threshold. It simplifies the formalities of house purchase for a large number of home buyers and costs nothing. The explanation of this is that under the 1931 legislation home buyers were required to produce to the stamp office of the Inland Revenue the conveyancing document, together with a form known as the particulars delivered form, which summarises details of the transaction.<br><br>
The conveyancing document has to be stamped with a stamp described as the produced stamp in addition to any ad valorem duty. Without the produced stamp, the purchaser cannot get his title to the property accepted. Therefore, in the case of a transfer of land which has to be registered, the conveyancing document has to be submitted to the stamp office before it can be forwarded to the Land Registry. That adds to the administrative cost of house purchase and also imposes work on the stamp duty office which serves no purpose.<br><br>
Therefore, it is proposed that this short-circuit method of procedure should be introduced and most conveyancing documents can go to the Land Registry instead of going through the stamp office first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about the short-circuit. People will still be paying stamp duty on these transactions, so when will they pay it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will pay it if they are above the £30,000 threshold.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Taking a transaction above the £30,000 threshold, when will people pay stamp duty as compared with the present arrangements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This proposal relates only to transactions that are below the threshold where no stamp duty is payable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed the original point and I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for explaining it to me. However, he referred to a reduction in the administrative costs of transactions in properties. What is his estimate of the reduction in these administrative costs which I assume will come from solicitors handling these transactions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to say because that takes only a limited time and there will be a reduction in postage and overheads. But the other feature to consider is delay. If we have an extra stage in the process of house purchase it is slowed down. There might also be costs involved for purchasers and sellers which relate to the amount of time that money is tied up, and so on. It is impossible to quantify it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of my hon. Friends suggested, in a sedentary intervention, that we shall all look forward to a reduction in charges from solicitors for this type of transaction. We shall also look forward to these transactions being completed more quickly. We have all experienced delays as buyers and sellers.</span></p>

CAPITAL TRANSFER TAX: CONDITIONAL EXEMPTION</div> <!-- title -->
<p>9.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eggar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 86, line 24, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>"save as otherwise specified therein".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 184, in Schedule 23, page 185, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"4A—(1) Section 33 of that Act (amount of charge under section 32, chargeable events) shall be amended as follows.
<ol>
<li>For subsection (1)(a) there shall be substituted—</li>
<ul>
<li>'(a) on an amount equal to the value of the property at the time of the chargeable event or if there was a conditionally exempt transfer or occasion in respect of the property after 31st July 1985 the value of the property at the time of the last conditionally exempt transfer or occasion if less; and'</li></ul>
<li>(3) In subsection (l)<i>(b)</i>(i) for 'at that time' there shall be substituted 'at the time of the chargeable event.'.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eggar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to the question of the charge to capital transfer tax on the loss of conditional exemption relating to works of art. Recently, much concern has been widely expressed in the media and the other place about the inadequacy of the Government's arrangements for retaining nationally important works of art in this country. There are two procedures for making retention easier: acceptance in lieu of CTT and private treaty sales.<br><br>
I think that it is generally agreed that the present arrangements do not operate as well as they might. The reasons for that are somewhat complex and relate to the attraction of what is known as the "douceur", which is the abatement of the capital tax due on the sale of an exempted item, which applies when one or other of the two procedures is used. For the "douceur" to have maximum effect, the object must have been exempted from CTT.<br><br>
Few owners are advised to exempt works of art if they can pay the tax when it is due, which makes it more likely that they will be sold later on the open market.<br><br>
Conditional exemption is not being taken because the basis on which tax is charged on a subsequent loss of exemption is unfair, and because of the roll-up effect of CTT, it can lead to a very heavy tax charge.<br><br>
A similar situation existed in the 1930s in reverse, when values of works of art dropped and people were assessed for estate duty at a higher level than that at which they would be assessed if they decided to sell their works of art.<br><br>
The amendments seek to revert to the pre-1930s position, when the value for tax was taken as the value at the last death. For CTT, it seeks to apply the lower of the current value and the value at the date of the last conditionally exempt transfer.<br><br>
The amendment is radical but important. We believe that it is wrong that the State should claim more CTT on the sale of an object which is exempted than the CTT which is deferred when exemption is granted. Any notional interest is discharged by the undertakings for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
maintenance on behalf of the State and public access. The amendment would not affect the CGT charge.<br><br>
The present system does not ensure that works of art remain in this country or that their owners take advantage of current methods of exemption. We are simply trying to make it more advantageous again for people to ensure through the tax authorities that works of art stay in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had some information about the amendment from the Historic Houses Association, which I think may have approached the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) who tabled his amendment as a result.<br><br>
I was impressed by the hon. Gentleman's argument about the importance of works of art remaining in the country and that the public should have access to them. The hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) was right to emphasise both those points. There is a degree of agreement between us about those matters.<br><br>
The information explaining the background to the clauses has arrived late in the day. In fact, I have received it only in the last few hours. Therefore I am not willing to give my wholehearted support to the amendment without having had time to consider those calculations. I appreciate that a particular case looms large in the thinking of the Historic Houses Association. However, I should like to work through the figures before I can support an amendment which might be used as a loophole.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman worried me a little when he referred to works of art being put on the open market and then later referred to works of art going abroad. Those two things are not synonymous. It is possible for works of art to be sold as a result of taxation law without the need for them to be sent abroad. Other provisions protect the heritage of this country to prevent works of art from being exported against the interests of people in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eggar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we want works of art to remain in this country at minimum cost to the nation. If those works of art are sold on the open market, international bidding will make the price higher than if they were sold only in a national market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall need to think about that point before I am sure that I agree with the hon. Member for Enfield, North.<br><br>
My interest is perhaps more narrow in that I am concerned to keep works of art in this country and that members of the public should have access to those works of art. I am not concerned about works of art being kept in the same ownership. When I listened to the hon. Gentleman I felt that that might have been what was behind the amendment. I am not concerned whether a work of art is owned by one weathly person or another. That is why I have reservations about the points made by the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps the difference between us is more imagined than real.<br><br>
I cannot go along with the hon. Gentleman's remarks because I have not had sufficient time in which to study the amendment and its detailed explanation before hand. It would help in future if we could have such detailed explanations at an earlier date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Rees)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a brief and interesting debate on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0830">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
amendment so elegantly moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar). I was glad to discover that there was a broad element of common ground between the two sides of the Committee. I hope that both sides of the Committee feel that it is important to retain works of art in this country, particularly those associated with our heritage, when fiscal concessions are made to achieve that end, so that the public can, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) said, have access to such works. That has been the principle underlying a great number of reliefs introduced by this Administration I am ready to pay tribute to some of the reliefs introduced by the previous Labour Administration. It is always pleasant to find a matter of common concern.<br><br>
One of the difficulties is the enormous and even extravagant increase in the prices paid for works of art. The market has become internationalised and, in many cases, resources available either to British institutions or individuals are not sufficient to match those that can be deployed by people outside. That opens up a much wider debate and it would not be appropriate to debate it entirely in the context of the amendments.<br><br>
The criticism that I level at the amendments is that the basis of conditional exemption is to offer a fiscal relief as an inducement for the owner—a British resident by definition—to keep those assets, associated with our national heritage, in this country subject to certain conditions.<br><br>
The effect of the proposals made by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North would be to lessen the fiscal penalty imposed when an owner wished to take the assets out of the state of conditional exemption, which would not be a breach in the pejorative sense, but would breach the conditions attached to conditional exemption. As I understand it, my hon. Friend is suggesting that when the assets come out of a state of conditional exemption, the charge should be made not by reference to the current value, but by reference either to the value at the date on which conditional exemption was granted, when the last potential charge could have been made or when there was a change in status of that kind. In other words, the value would be taken further back on the basis that there has been—I hope that I have not chosen too highly charged language to describe this—a rather extravagant increase in the international value of the objects.<br><br>
I shall try to explain as succinctly as I know how. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North wishes to diminish the fiscal penalty for taking the assets of a state of conditional exemption. As my hon. Friend has rightly said, because of the extravagant increase in value it often pays people now to take the charge because they can sell the assets in the open market at a figure which a generation ago would have been regarded as inconceivable. That may be so. I say no more than that. We must address the problem in some way. However, I suggest that the amendment is not the right way because we are making it easier for people to take an asset out of a state of conditional exemption and sell it on the open market, where it might attract bidders from abroad. If anything, the proposal might ease, not make more difficult, the export of works of art from this country. Morover, there are other dimensions to the problem.<br><br>
Although my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North has identified a problem which exercises me,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
members of the Administration and especially exercises my right honourable and noble Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, I suggest that this may not be the way to approach the problem. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North and the hon. Member for Hodge Hill will put their heads together to produce a solution that will command wider acceptance. However, as the proposal stands, I doubt whether it will advance the cause which we all have at heart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eggar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept my right honourable and learned Friend's, argument but I sense that he recognises that there is a genuine problem. I believe that he accepts that the reward, as it were, gained by breaking the conditional exemption is too great now because too many works of art are sold on the open market instead of going through either procedure. Has my right honourable and learned Friend concrete proposals for trying somewhat to redress the balance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could air my theories, but I must respond by saying that I have no carefully thought-out solutions to commend to the Committee. Even if I could, Miss Fookes, I doubt whether I should be within the rules of order if I responded tonight. However, I would not wish to deter—indeed, how could I—my hon. Friend or the hon. Member for Hodge Hill from returning to the general question underlying the amendments. I merely suggest that the amendments do not provide the kind of solution for which we all are searching.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eggar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that, having recognised the problem, right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary could have been more forthcoming about a solution. I accept the problems inherent in the amendment and will gladly withdraw it, but I hope that my right honourable and learned Friend will look at the issue during the coming months, perhaps with the hon. Member for Hodge Hill, and that an all-party conclusion can be agreed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As with amendment No. 183, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar), these two amendments, and two subsequent amendments that I hope to move later, have been suggested by the Historic Houses Association, the president of which is one of my constituents. His wonderful home is Rockingham Castle in Northamptonshire. It is visited by thousands of people every year and has become famous during the past two years because of the television serial "By the Sword Divided".<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
Schedule 23 proposes three substantive changes in the rules for designation of heritage property. The first change is the removal of the requirement that for protecting land to qualify for conditional exemption it must adjoin the historic house. That is achieved by paragraph 2(2), which inserts a new subsection in the Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984, which is identical, except for the inclusion of the words "area of, to that proposed in the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North at the request of the Historic Houses Association at the Committee stage of the passage of the Finance Bill last year.<br><br>
Paragraphs 1, 2(2), 3 and 4 of schedule 23 introduce new rules to deal with entitlements consisting of a historic house, protecting land and associated objects that are in separate ownership. The new rules will require undertakings to be given by the owner or owners of the house and of such other properties as the Treasury thinks appropriate in support of an application to exempt any part of the entity.<br><br>
The third proposal is a new rule to require all undertakings in support of claims for conditional exemption—for works of art and scenic land as well as historic houses and their protecting land and associated objects—to state the steps to be taken for their preservation and for reasonable public access and, where applicable, for maintenance.<br><br>
In this rather arcane area of law, there is one substantive change that the schedule makes to the existing rules, which were first introduced in the Finance Act 1975 and amended in the Finance Act 1976. Both pieces of legislation were sponsored by the party that is now the official Opposition. It was the amendment made in 1976 to the original proposal of 1975 that demonstrates, yet again, that it is not just the present Government who find it necessary to amend their financial legislation in subsequent years; that fate has also befallen a previous Government, too.<br><br>
The law under the Finance Acts of 1975 and 1976 was that the person making the undertaking was required to take reasonable steps for repair, preservation, and so on, and to secure reasonable public access. The formula provided an adequate basis for detailed negotiations between the Treasury and the person concerned until the need for such detail was challenged in law. Paragraph 2(2) of the schedule proposes to substitute
<br><blockquote><p>"such steps as are agreed between the Treasury and the person giving the undertaking, and are set out in it,".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the change between the legislation of 1975 and 1976, and what is proposed in schedule 23, is that the word "reasonable" be dropped.<br><br>
Knowing as I do my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary, I have not the slightest doubt that while he has any responsibility for these matters the Treasury will conduct itself on a reasonable basis, but I am certain that he would wish to hand on to his successor, whoever he may be and however long that change may be in coming, the requirement that he should act in exactly the same way as my right honourable and learned Friend intends to act. It is to institutionalise that in our law that I move the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) on his advocacy of the amendment. In his early remarks he referred to the main purpose of the schedule—to deal with adjoining land.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
I shall not comment on that for the moment. It would be better to discuss that in the clause stand part debate if we are allowed one. Instead, I shall concentrate on the amendment which deals, as the hon. Gentleman explained, with a requirement that the Treasury should ask only for "reasonable" steps to be taken.<br><br>
It is important to emphasise that we are talking about a tax concession. The present arrangements mean that if someone wishes to obtain this tax concession, he must agree arrangements with the Treasury for the maintenance of the historic property and for public access to it. There must be an agreement between the Treasury and the beneficiary—the person owning or living in the property—before that person obtains any tax concession.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct to say that the Treasury is proposing to drop the requirement that the steps should be reasonable. I can understand the hon. Gentleman's concern about that point. However, it is important to emphasise why the Treasury is taking that action. I understand from my own inquiries that the Treasury is deliberately dropping the word "reasonable" from the rules as a result of remarks to it by the representatives of a particular applicant for that tax concession. As my hon. Friend will readily appreciate, the word "reasonable" can be a matter of litigation.<br><br>
In the past, the tax concession has been given only if there is an agreement between the Treasury and the person requesting it. Of course the Treasury can be described as being, to use a Birmingham expression, in the pound seats. It can always refuse to come to an agreement with the applicant. The ultimate decision rests with the Treasury. I must emphasise again that we are talking about tax concessions which can involve a great deal of money. I have defended to my hon. Friends and others the arrangements for these tax concessions on the grounds that we want to preserve the heritage of this country and to obtain access for the public to that heritage. Nevertheless, it is a tax concession. What is reasonable is a matter of opinion. The people who are asking for these tax concessions may consider the Treasury's requests in the matter unreasonable. But they are applying for a tax concession. The Treasury is ultimately charged with the task of protecting the public interest and the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
Ultimately, I incline to the view that it is for the Treasury to decide whether what is being offered is acceptable and reasonable. It will be giving something which is worth a great deal of money to some people. As I have already hinted, I understand that someone threatened the Treasury or gave a warning that if it would not agree to what was being offered recourse would be taken to legal proceedings. I do not consider that to be reasonable—if I can use that word in the context of this debate. It is entirely appropriate that if the Treasury concludes that what it is being offered is not worth the tax concession that it would give, it can apologise, but insist that the ordinary tax laws apply.<br><br>
There can be disagreements but I have every confidence that the Treasury will not be over-generous or mean in dealing with the matter. The record shows that the Treasury has been responsible and reasonable in its dealings, regardless of who happens to be the Chief Secretary or which Administration are in power. It is best left to the discussion and negotiation between the Treasury and the representatives of the person applying for the tax concession.<br><br>

I do not want to allow the possibility of the matter being decided, not by the Treasury, which is responsible to the House of Commons, but by judges in a court of law. I am anxious to avoid the possibility of litigation. That is why I shall oppose the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow the line taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis). I strongly oppose the amendment because in my view what the Government propose in the schedule is correct. It is right that there should be agreement on access, repairs, and so on. I say that as one who is interested in preserving our heritage. I am a member of the National Trust, and I enjoy looking round stately homes. I could, of course, criticise the way some owners got their stately homes, but that would not be relevant to the amendment. In fact, I often think that the country does not do enough to preserve the past heritage of ordinary working people, because that is equally relevant to the history and development of the country.<br><br>
It is right for us to try to preserve these homes and keep the furniture and accommodation intact. In my area, my council was fortunate enough to acquire a stately home at a relatively cheap price at the turn of the century. Towneley hall in Burnley is a popular tourist attraction. It would not be covered by the provision, but there are many houses that would be covered.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill said, this is a tax concession that stately homes want. If ultimately they do not like the proposals for access, they do not have to accept them, in which case they will have to pay the tax. They cannot have it both ways.<br><br>
Of course, there can be argument about what is reasonable. On the subject of the hours during which houses are open to public access, I have heard of people who think that if they open one day a month they should be eligible for a tax concession of this type. I would not accept that as reasonable, although the person whose home it is and who wants to continue to live in it may feel that that is reasonable.<br><br>
However, it is not just a matter of hours. It should cover the sections of buildings that are available to the public. After all, the owner could say, "I don't want the public to see the most interesting parts of the building and its most worthwhile objects of art, furniture, and so on." So there are various aspects to access, and I believe that the Government's proposals are reasonable and fair. The same is true of repairs, because there must be a responsibility to ensure that the building is repaired and kept up to standard.<br><br>
So I find myself in the odd position of supporting a Government proposal, because it is fair, sensible and reasonable. If a tax concession is granted, the rest of the public have to bear the burden and they have the right to the reasonable, agreed access that is proposed in the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting if somewhat refined debate on the niceties of statutory construction. I am a little diffident in offering a concluded view on all the legal ramifications that could be involved. However, let us see how much common ground there is.<br><br>
We are dealing here with a relief from capital transfer tax as a form of fiscal relief. Of that there is no doubt. But we should recall that the relief was introduced not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 560</span>
out of sentiment for the owners, but in the hard-headed belief that we are more likely to retain for the benefit of future generations our heritage—our assets. I feel that there is common ground between us on that. We all wish to keep a rich national heritage, available as far as possible for the enjoyment of all. I am sure that no Administration would wish to impose unreasonable conditions in that respect.<br><br>
9.45 p.m.<br><br>
What are the practical effects of the amendment likely to be? The original provisions were brought together in the Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984. Section 31(2) says that the Treasury is entitled to require that
<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable steps will be taken for the preservation of the property and for securing reasonable access to the public."</p></blockquote>
I trust that the matter transcends party divisions. It seems that in schedule 23(2) a degree of reasonableness will be expected of the Treasury in the steps agreed upon and taken, but I would not attempt to forecast the outcome of litigation. I well understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) to keep the matter out of the courts. No doubt we approach it in slightly different ways; I do not have the same reservations in that respect. On the other hand, these practical issues of administration should not be the subject of scrutiny, regularly and relentlessly.<br><br>
However, it would be quite improper for me to speak for the judiciary.<br><br>
If the Treasury were to press for unreasonable conditions and there was a failure to reach agreement because of that—that is, judged by objective standards—the owner could probably take out a prerogative writ to have the matter tested in the courts. I do not believe that by rejecting the amendment we would necessarily exclude all possibility of litigation in this respect. Indeed, I doubt whether accepting it would add anything to paragraph 2(2) of schedule 23.<br><br>
I am always happy to have the word "reasonable" dripped over any legislation for which I am responsible. I like to think that its use will stand scrutiny by reasonable people in the House, the courts, and so on. On that modest basis, I shall recommend the Committee to accept the amendment, but it should not be imagined that anything fundamental will be done to the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must express my disappointment in this respect. Usually, these matters proceed on a basis of consensus in the Committee; I shal vote against the amendment. Conservative Members may complain about that, but they should have convinced us much earlier that the amendment was reasonable. I do not want to import the possibility of litigation into these affairs; that seems to be the purpose behind the amendment.<br><br>
The Chief Secretary told us that in effect the requirement for reasonableness already existed in the Bill, irrespective of whether the amendment was accepted. The Treasury's record has been reasonable; I make no complaint in that respect. But I have it on some authority that legal proceedings—I do not know whether I am telling the Minister something that he has not been told, and I certainly do not wish to break confidences, but I have suspicions about the estate involved—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be absolutely open with the Committee. I asked whether there had been difficulties in the past, and the answer that I received from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0833">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 561</span>
those more experienced than me is that there had been difficulties which arose over undertakings. They did not arise from the word "reasonable"—I am talking about the Capital Transfer Act 1984 which this schedule is due to supersede. I can tell of one case which did not proceed to litigation and did not arise over the word "reasonable".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the matter did not proceed to litigation, but we do not know why, any more than the Chief Secretary knows. We do not know whether, under threat of litigation, the civil servants gave in and gave what was asked. However, common ground between us is that litigation was threatened. I urge the Chief Secretary to think again. As he said, there is much common ground between us. We both agree that it is a tax concession, and I think we agree that there should be proper provision for the maintenance of historic property, and for public access, in return for the tax concession. We agree that such requirements should be reasonable, and I am absolutely sure that the overwhelming majority of the people who have benefited in the past from this tax concession, and will apply for it in future, would also wish to be reasonable in the undertakings that they gave and the arrangements that they made, so that they could have the tax concession.<br><br>
I am not concerned about the majority of cases about which there will be no dispute or disagreement, or threat of litigation or legal proceedings. My hon. Friends and I are concerned about the minority, who would not wish to be what we regard as reasonable and are not being what the Treasury regards as reasonable but who would use the threat of legal proceedings to extract from the Treasury arrangements which otherwise would not be given.<br><br>
The Chief Secretary has said that, even if the amendment is not accepted, there will still be a legal requirement on the Treasury to be reasonable, and that a person could go to court and apply for a writ of prerogative to compel the Treasury to be reasonable in the view of a court. I was not trying to tease the Chief Secretary about his eminent position in the legal profession. Perhaps he is not aware that my first degree was in law, so I have a healthy respect for good lawyers.—[<i>Interruption</i>] It is a closely guarded secret among the Opposition. It has obviously come as a surprise to some of my hon. Friends. I am not a professional lawyer but I learnt enough law to know not to give legal advice. I am not casting aspertions on lawyers in general or on judges, of course. But I do not think that this matter can be taken to a court of law.<br><br>
The advantage of Treasury civil servants is that they will be able to compare the arrangements that they are offering or requiring in some instances with arrangements agreed with many landowners in many other cases. I am not satisfied that that can be done properly in a court. Such decisions will be finely drawn as to what is reasonable and what is not. There will be differences. I am worried that we shall have legal proceedings and case law after case law about what is reasonable.<br><br>
The subject has not arisen before because there has not been litigation about this tax concession. We have rubbed along—different sides of the House and the parties—and there has been tremendous consensus
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 562</span>
because, although there have been differing views on different matters, there is a common wish to preserve our heritage. Similarly, the Treasury have rubbed along with landowners who have asked for this concession. It is a tax concession, and there has been a certain amount of give and take. We are worried that some people will want more take than give, which is why we have great reservations about the amendment.<br><br>
It would be presumptuous of me to hope that I have persuaded the Chief Secretary that he is mistaken, but he did not explain why the word "reasonable" had been dropped from the Bill. If the word has no meaning and the requirement to be reasonable had no effect, was it dropped by accident? Has this change in the law been brought about by oversight or inadvertence on the part of the Treasury? I do not believe that, because I have a great respect for the Treasury and should have expected it to have a good reason for deciding to drop the requirement to be reasonable. I believe that it was dropped because threats were made to take the Treasury to court, and I am not willing to have this tax concession bandied about and decided in that fashion.<br><br>
My hon. Friends will make up their own minds, but I am inclined to vote against the amendment even if the Chief Secretary wishes to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee about one matter. I know of no case where litigation has been threatened, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept, at least for as long as we are responsible for the conduct of business in the Treasury, that the threat of litigation is unlikely to move us in a case where we believe that the taxpayer has been unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disturbed by the turn of events in the Committee in the past ten minutes, and I do not believe that it is reasonable for the Chief Secretary to accept the amendment. I say that, first, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) and, secondly, because the whole matter of tax relief on historic houses needs a thorough overhaul.<br><br>
I take the view that if a person who is very wealthy lives in such a house, the duty to preserve it for the nation is for him and not for the nation. It is the nation's duty to preserve a house, an object and so on, only if those who enjoy their benefits are not able to look after them themselves. I am very sorry that the Chief Secretary accepts the amendment, and I shall note this in my diary. After the next general election and the return of a Labour Government, when my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill is made Chief Secretary, I shall be the first to knock on his door to demand a thorough review of all those procedures. In particular, we shall ensure that relief is given only where it is necessary and not when it is already being given to people who can well afford the upkeep and maintenance of the houses and objects from which they benefit.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friends agree that there is a need for an urgent review of those matters and that it will not be too long before we undertake it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pike</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the Chief Secretary's argument very puzzling. He said that the addition of the word "reasonable" to the change that the Government proposed in the Bill was not necessary because it would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0834">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 563</span>
superfluous. If he will not change his mind and intends to support the amendment, he is admitting that the Government and the Treasury are not reasonable in other respects. The word "reasonable" could be included time after time not only in this but in virtually every other Bill. It is nonsense to add the word "reasonable", and I hope that the amendment will be defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and spirited debate, not least because the purpose of my amendment is to preserve the existing law which, of course, was originally proposed and passed by a Labour Government. I am grateful to my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary for his answer, and I ask my hon. Friends to join me in supporting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In regard to access to such properties, I shall not embark on the argument about the review made by my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) and for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). I believe that there is a need for that. However, access to such properties and national assets is crucial.<br><br>
While watching television recently, I heard mention of the statistic that there are now more than one million millionaires in the United States while at the same time, there is extreme poverty in that country. More people want to invest in such assets, and we need to ensure that we are not maintaining private collections but creating national assets which everyone may visit free of charge.</span></p>

<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>10.30 p.m</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p>[Mr. Ted Leadbitter <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An advantage of the length of time that Divisions take is that everyone has the opportunity of reflecting upon matters that have arisen during a debate. We had an interesting discussion and I noted what my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary said. I noted also the remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), not all of which were favourable to the amendment. However, he suggested that there was a substantial agreement between both sides of the Committee, although at the margins he felt that it was not possible to support the amendment because it could be used for a purpose which was not intended.<br><br>
Heritage matters have, for at least a decade, commanded cross-party support. I believe that it is right to say that no such matter has been pushed to a Division for ten years or more. I would not wish to break that understanding between the parties. It is very important in a matter which is devoid of party political content that that agreement is not destroyed. Stability of policy in taxation is paramount to those who are liable to tax and to the public who stand to benefit through the enjoyment of amenities which a tax regime may allow.<br><br>
I am sure that members of the Committee will wish to reflect on some of the points raised during the debate. In the circumstances, I am confident that if I were to press the amendment to a Division, I should secure the support of the Committee, but I shall not do so.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 564</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman has spoken and the fact that he has said that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I thank him for his courtesy in telling me that he intended to take that action. The hon. Gentleman is one of the most reasonable lawyers that I have met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 185, line 13, leave out from "that" to end of line 14 and insert:—
<br><blockquote><p>"the associated properties (other than the part disposed of or subject to the failure to observe an undertaking as aforesaid) has not been materially affected as an entity of outstanding historic or architectural interest".</p></blockquote>
In the light of the concluding remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), I must not push my luck too far in a test of reasonableness. However, the purpose of this amendment is to clarify the test which is to be applied in law if a conditional exemption of a historic house is to continue, despite the fact that a part of the associated property is disposed. The present position is derived from the Finance Act 1975 as amended by—bless its heart—the Finance Act 1976, to include, among other things, outstanding buildings and their historically associated contents and amenity land which was described as a heritage entity.<br><br>
The intention was that where a property qualified for exemption by virtue of its association with an outstanding building, a breach of the undertaking in relation to any property forming part of the resulting entity would bring down a charge to tax on the whole. However, if the Treasury were satisfied that the entity was not "materially affected"—those are the words of the statute—by whatever breach had taken place, the tax charge would be restricted to the property directly concerned.<br><br>
I understand that this provision of the 1975 and 1976 Acts has not been tested in the courts and that its administration has caused no difficulty. I tabled the amendment because of the more flexible arrangements in schedule 13, which exempts amenity land in different ownership.<br><br>
An entity already under exemption in its own right might have more land added to it at a later date. The amendment would alter the wording so that if a breach occurred in some or all of the additional land, the test for assessing whether the entity had been materially affected would be quantitative and qualitative. Account should be taken of whether the remaining elements of the entity would have qualified for the exemption in their own right.<br><br>
Briefly, I am asking for an extension of the existing rule so that it relates to quality as well as to quantity. I cannot put the argument more succinctly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may amuse the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) to know that, even before his gesture on the previous amendment, I was inclined to offer our support on this amendment.<br><br>
Someone might be affected by a compulsory purchase order for, say, a road running through some of his land. It would be grossly unfair for him to lose the tax concession on the total when the road ran only through
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0835">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 565</span>
a small part of the land, and did not do so on the owner's wishes. That is a persuasive and compelling argument.<br><br>
Opposition Members are worried about the possibility of creating loopholes. We shall wait for the Chief Secretary's reply before we decide on our attitude. I am persuaded by the hon. Member for Corby that there is a case to be considered and we are inclined to support him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in some difficulty. The consensus has been re-established, but without my being a party to it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) moved the amendment with his customary succinctness and persuasiveness. There is a precedent which has been in operation since 1976 and which is now embodied in section 32(6) of the Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984. We are dealing with a slightly different area because of the new clauses and schedule, but the Revenue has always taken account in practical terms of the "material effect" of any act on what remains of the property or the asset subject to conditional exemption.<br><br>
I am happy to give an undertaking to the Committee, although I am a little reluctant to commend my hon. Friend's amendment. It is not feasible to spell out in detail how the "materially affected" rule might apply in individual cases. Despite my hon. Friend's skill as a draftsman, the amendment is not a watertight provision. The application of the rule must depend on the precise circumstances.<br><br>
I am sure that the whole Committee is concerned. When considering the application of the provision in individual cases, the Treasury will examine all relevant factors in the light of advice of the appropriate advisory bodies. The decision will not depend only on the view of the ipse dixit of someone in the Treasury or even of a mere Minister. A relevant factor to which weight will be given will be whether what remains of the entity after the sale or breach of undertaking might qualify for exemption as a viable heritage unit looked at on its own merits.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will realise that I have weighed my words with extreme care. I am very happy to give my undertaking that the provisions will be applied in that way. If, after some years, the House is dissatisfied with the way in which they work in this sensitive area, we shall be happy to look at the problem again. I recognize the anxieties that have been expressed and I realise that in some situations they could be soundly based, although not in every case. If what has happened destroys the entity as heritage, we must ask whether conditional exemption should remain.<br><br>
I hope that with that undertaking, my hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my right honourable and learned Friend for the way in which he has answered the query raised in the amendment. It is obvious from the remarks of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) that there is a problem. I accept that, as my right honourable and learned Friend says, the form of words proposed in the amendment may not be entirely satisfactory. The Historic Houses Association and others affected will wish to reflect on my right honourable and learned
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 566</span>
Friend's undertaking and see how the administration works in practice. Therefore, it would be wrong to press the matter now and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 188, in page 185, line 18, at end insert:—
<br><blockquote><p>"4A For paragraph 4(4) of Schedule 6 to that Act there shall be substituted:—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) No estate duty shall be charged on an object left out of account under section 40 of the Finance Act 1930 which has passed on a death since 6th April 1976 but for the purposes of this paragraph and the said section 40 and section 48 of the Finance Act 1950 there shall be disregarded any death after 6th April 1976 on which the transfer of the object was exempt under section 18 of this Act (transfers between spouses)'.".</p></blockquote>
We may have been dealing with marginal but important areas of policy in the tax regime as it affects the Historic Houses Association, but we now come to a very technical area. It is the interaction between estate duty and capital transfer tax, which applies only to works of art. It will not necessarily have any bearing on future exemptions or sales, but it will remove an anomaly under which the taxpayer is treated unfairly.<br><br>
The problem arises from the different nature of the two taxes. Works of art exempted under estate duty prior to the introduction of capital transfer tax can also be exempted under CTT, but the rates and conditions for the two exemptions are different.<br><br>
The Capital Transfer Tax Act applies where the donor died prior to 1976, by bringing the charges totally within the capital transfer tax system once a conditionally exempt transfer under that Act has taken place. However, if exemption is not sought and capital transfer tax is paid on the first transfer after the donor's death, the estate duty exemption continues until the object is sold. Tax then becomes payable at estate duty rates, which may be well in excess of capital transfer tax rates.<br><br>
The capital transfer tax paid is allowed as a credit against the estate duty, but under estate duty rules, the exemption becomes absolute on the second death. That was the basis on which the exemption was taken. The continuation of the estate duty liability after a death when capital transfer tax has been paid is therefore an unwarranted and retrospective change in the terms on which the original estate duty exemption was given.<br><br>
I apologise for going into such an arcane area, but the taxes overlap. The continuing provisions of estate duty law, even though that tax has now been abolished for the future, create a potential unfairness for the taxpayer. The purpose of the amendment is to restore the position in which, if the first transfer after the donor's death is itself on a death, no estate duty should be charged in respect of the death, whether or not a CTT exemption is sought, unless the second death itself gives rise to an exempt transfer between spouses in the ordinary provision of the law.</span></p>
<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) has said, this is a complicated matter. I have discussed it with some representatives of the Historic Houses Association, but I must confess that I understood it much better after listening to the hon. Member for Corby than I did after lisening to those most closely affected. I now declare myself an agnostic.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 567</span>
I await the Chief Secretary's contribution, which I am sure will persuade me.<br><br>
On the one hand, I think some people feel that a sword of Damocles is hanging over their heads and want to settle tax liabilities dating from years ago. On the other hand, I am concerned about the potential loophole and the possible loss of revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am flattered that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) should await my advice on such an arcane subject. I only hope that I can speak with the clarity shown by the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell), whose assiduity commands my admiration and, I suspect, that of other members of the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is concerned with the clawback charged to estate duty that can arise in certain circumstances in which the capital transfer tax paid on an earlier transfer would be allowed as a credit against it. The amendment proposes that in such circumstances the estate duty charged should be forgone, leaving the capital transfer tax charge to stand alone. I gather that the unfairness, if such it is—I am not entirely persuaded of that—arises particularly in cases where the estate duty exceeds the capital transfer tax.<br><br>
I rather doubt whether this raises a question of equity. But I fear that the amendment to which my hon. Friend has spoken so persuasively would weaken the disincentive to owners to sell heritage property on the open market. I think it was established in our debate on the first amendment after our return from the dinner adjournment that hon. Members on both sides want to preserve that disincentive.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) drew attention to a wider problem in his first amendment. I fear that it would be out of order to discuss it on this amendment, but perhaps we can come back to it on another occasion. We have set up a complex series of rules designed to encourage people to obtain conditional exemption and to discourage them from selling works of art on the open market, paying the duty and allowing valuable pieces of our heritage to disappear from our shores merely because market circumstances may have altered, which I readily admit they have done. I hope that my hon. Friend will not feel obliged to press his amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right honourable and learned Friend.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Twenty-third schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the basic provision in the Schedule to the Chief Secretary, and, through him, to the Treasury. As the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) said, the main thrust of the schedule is to accept the point urged on the Treasury a year ago by the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) and me concerning the peculiar problem of what constitutes "adjoining" land. I gave the example of a moated country house, in which the land could in no

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
THE NATIONAL HERITAGE: TRANSFER OF TREASURY FUNCTIONS TO BOARD</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spoil the atmosphere of conviviality. However, having expressed appreciation to the Chief Secretary on the subject of schedule 23, I want to express strong reservations about clause 89, if not outright opposition to it.<br><br>
Clause 89 transfers the responsibility for dealing with these matters from the Treasury to the Inland Revenue. As my hon. Friends have explained in their contributions to earlier debates, we feel strongly about the arrangements for the preservation of our heritage. We support the arrangements for concessions—they were originally introduced by a Labour Government—but we believe that it is important that there should be a proper return to the public for what is given.<br><br>
At present the Treasury is responsible for ensuring that there is a proper return. The Treasury must be convinced that the property is important enough to warrant a concession; it must approve the arrangements for the maintenance fund and it is responsible for monitoring the activities of that fund. The Treasury is also responsible for agreeing arrangements for public access and for monitoring the undertakings as a whole. Clause 89 would transfer all those responsibilities to the Inland Revenue. We are most concerned about that proposal, and I should be grateful if the Chief Secretary would explain the Government's reasoning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the hon. Gentleman's questions, and I hope that I shall be able to assuage his concern. Again, we are at one on the matter in that we both want to see this complex regime administered in the most satisfactory way possible so that an even balance can be struck between the interests of the owner and the interests of the general public, as represented either by the Treasury or by the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
The Government's thinking was as simple as this. As the quantifying and levying of tax is a matter for the Inland Revenue and as the Revenue would be concerned to impose a charge to tax and collect it if there were a breach of condition, it would be better if the whole process were operated by the Revenue instead of being split between the Revenue and the Treasury.<br><br>
I assure the Committee that this Administration, at least, do not intend that there should be any change in the approach adopted to these problems. I think that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), with his great experience of these matters, would find it hard to argue that the Inland Revenue was less exacting than the Treasury in its defence of the national interest. It is purely a matter of administrative coherence that the whole complex—designation, direction, the imposition of conditions and decisions as to whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0837">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 569</span>
they have been breached—should be administered by the body concerned with the valuation and a charge to tax initially and, indeed, on the breach of any conditions.<br><br>
I do not believe that we should surrender our judgment in such matters to outside bodies—even to bodies as expert and experienced as the Historic Houses Association. Representatives of that body are here today, and I know that they will not mind what I am saying.<br><br>
As the strongest upholder of the interest of the owners of heritage property, the association welcomes the move. It is not for me to speculate why it does so, but I can assure it and the Committee that we do not intend any relaxation of the concern for the public interest by the Department responsible. We, and I think also those on the other side of the fence, the representatives of the heritage owners, feel that all the functions should be drawn together and placed in the hands of one Department. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept this somewhat technical clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must disabuse the Chief Secretary. When he described the Historic Houses Association as welcoming the change, he was referring to a printed document that I have not had the benefit of reading. However, I have taken the precaution of checking the views of the representatives of the association who had approached me.<br><br>
I understand that the association does not welcome the change. As I should not like to be accused of misrepresenting their view, a form of words was agreed between the representatives and myself. The association is broadly neutral on the provision: it does not welcome it, nor ask for it. The Government have not been requested by those most interested in the subject to make this change.<br><br>
I am open to correction by the Chief Secretary, but I understand that the initiative for the change came from the Government. The Historic House Association is saying, "If that is how the Government wish to do it, we shall not question their decision. The association is neutral on the issue.<br><br>
What are the merits of the proposal? I accept the Chief Secretary's assurance that he does not intend any change in the way in which these matters are approached. That is not the same as saying that there should be no change. My fear is that it will not be part of the responsibility of the Chief Secretary or often Treasury Ministers to intervene in the way in which the Inland Revenue negotiates and administers the undertakings.<br><br>
I accept that the Inland Revenue already has certain responsibilities, and I am not worried by the way in which it is discharging those. However, I am anxious about the way in which the existing responsiblilites of the Treasury will be handled in future.<br><br>
We have no criticism of the way in which the Treasury has discharged its responsibilities in the past. However, the Chief Secretary and other Treasury Ministers are responsible directly to the House of Commons for the way decisions are taken by the Treasury. The degree of accountability for decisions taken by the Inland Revenue is different. We are considering questions of judgment here, for example about which undertakings are reasonable; what should be requested or required before tax concessions are given; about undertakings on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 570</span>
individual cases, for there is often a read-across from one case to another. Delicate judgments must be made, and a balance struck between the interest of the public and the desire of the taxpayer to reduce his tax. I make no bones about the fact that we wish the Treasury to err on the side of the public interest.<br><br>
We should prefer that the responsibility be discharged by the Treasury so that in the event of any future disagreement we could question the Minister more closely than we can when decisions are taken by the Inland Revenue. We are worried that responsibility is being transferred from a Department whose Ministers are responsible to the House of Commons to the Inland Revenue, which is not accountable in the same way or to the same extent.<br><br>
I cast no aspersions on the civil servants involved in the Treasury or in the Inland Revenue. Indeed, I have already praised the work of the civil servants and the Treasury who were concerned in this matter. I understand that they are grossly overworked, but it is not for me to inquire about the internal workings of the Treasury, at present, anyway. But I understand that the man responsible at the most senior level for these matters is also concerned with everything to do with the Health Service. I am not sure about the connection, and I suspect that he also has a number of other responsibilities. Who knows which Department of State and other matters are also his concern?<br><br>
11 p.m.<br><br>
Criticisms have been expressed by people who try to negotiate with the Treasury about delays. My understanding is that individuals are not being criticised; it is the inadequate provision of staff for dealing with this matter which is being criticised. This is a legitimate area of debate and of difference between the Government and the Opposition.<br><br>
The point of principle is whether these decisions should be taken in the Treasury, where a Minister is responsible to the House of Commons.<br><br>
We feel strongly about the matter, but I am not suggesting that the Chief Secretary's intention should be any different. It is a matter of principle how decisions affecting the public interest in such arrangements are negotiated in return for tax concessions. Any tax concessions which are given are subsidised by taxpayers.<br><br>
We believe that those decisions should be taken by people—we do not believe that the Chief Secretary looks at each case himself—for whom the Chief Secretary is ultimately responsible to the House of Commons. I do not think that any Minister is responsible for the Inland Revenue, and it is not for me to suggest that in the Inland Revenue there might be a disposition in one direction or another, but it is possible. We would much rather have the ability to question, and criticise if we disagree, a Minister of the Crown who can defend decisions taken in such a delicate matter.<br><br>
Therefore, I have great reservations about the clause, and I hope that the Chief Secretary will explain further about his reasons for wanting to transfer this responsibility from the Treasury to the Inland Revenue. I do not accept that it is as simple as he suggested earlier. It is not simply a matter of saying that we should allow the responsibility to be undertaken by the Inland Revenue. There is no more reason for the Inland Revenue to undertake this responsibility than any other responsibility for taxation matters.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0838">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 571</span>
We do not expect the Inland Revenue to decide rates of tax, what should be taxed or other matters. I accept that there is a slight difference here because a tax concession is involved, but there is a decision to be made about the tax which will not be charged in return for undertakings. That is a matter of discretion about whether those undertakings are reasonable, acceptable and justified and is a subsidy which is given in the form of a tax concession.<br><br>
For those reasons, and principally the one of accountability, I am not falling out with or criticising the Chief Secretary for decisions for which he has been responsible in this area in the past—there are many other matters about which I could disagree with the Chief Secretary, and he knows that.<br><br>
I want to maintain that responsibility so that if ever I, or any other Member of Parliament, wish to criticise a decision we are able to do so directly to the Chief Secretary or other Treasury Ministers who are responsible. I do not think that will appertain if decisions are taken by the Inland Revenue. We prefer a Minister in the Treasury to be responsible for decisions on what undertakings are acceptable in return for tax concessions. The matter can then be handed over to the Inland Revenue to act, in a sense, as a policeman to ensure that those undertakings are honoured by the person who has given them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) certainly raises an interesting point, and I do not underestimate the force of what he has to say.<br><br>
First, I want to make a point about outside bodies, because it is not for us to surrender our judgment to an outside body however important, influential or well informed. I realise that reference has been made from both sides of the Committee to a deal, since the dinner adjournment, with the Historic Houses Association. I only remarked about an article in the journal Spring this year by Mr. Anthony Furze, who is, I understand, the chairman of their taxation committee. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed change has been carefully considered and if implemented will have our support and may lead to quicker decisions on applications".</p></blockquote>
While the end of Treasury involvement would be a matter for regret, the Historic Houses Association's tax committee has always had equally courteous, well-informed and helpful attention from the senior officials of both the Treasury and the Inland Revenue. I am delighted that one body that has regular contact with both those two great Departments of State awards them the equal palm in this situation.<br><br>
However, that is not what we are discussing. We are debating a constitutional matter. All Committee members may, if they wish, question the Minister about the existing arrangements or the arrangements in the clause, which I commend to the Committee.<br><br>
This Administration do not intend to alter the constitutional position. Administrations do not always appreciate what they commend and pass into law, but I am advised that the clause will not alter the constitutional position. Hon. Members may question Treasury Ministers about whether the responsibilities are split between the Treasury and Inland Revenue, as they have been up to now, or are concentrated in Somerset house.<br><br>
Conservative Members are just as concerned about the matter as Opposition Members are. If hon. Members find that they are inhibited by the rules of order
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 572</span>
or constitutional precedent from dealing with problems of this sort in future, we shall be prepared to reconsider the matter. My right honourable and hon. Friends and I will not shut out legitimate questions or debate by reason of the changes advocated by the clause.<br><br>
I hope that the Member for Hodge Hill will give us the benefit of the doubt, tonight at any rate. I do not think that his fears will be confirmed. The provision is purely mechanical, not constitutional. If the advice which I have received proves wrong and the courts or the custodians of the rules of the House say, "No, the position is different now", we shall obviously have to reconsider the matter.<br><br>
I emphasise that the provision is mechanical, which I hope will make for the better and more expeditious dispatch of business in this area. I hope that that will serve the interests of both the general public and the owners of heritage property. If we are proved wrong, we shall certainly return to the matter. I hope that, with that assurance, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to accept the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given a handsome and full assurance. I am sure that he does not intend to change the situation. He has assured us that if he is mistaken, has been misadvised, or there is any change whatsoever, which would be against the wishes of the present Administration, he would be willing to revert to the previous situation. That is a generous assurance, which I accept in the spirit in which it was given.<br><br>
I raise one more matter, as gently as I can. A year ago, I suggested to one of the Treasury Ministers that it would be advantageous if the Treasury took the unusual step of having discussions with the Opposition before matters were put into Finance Bills. I suggested that it might lead to a more clearly defined consensus. We could exchange views without detaining a whole Committee and all the officials involved. It could lead to better legislation and agreement between the Government and the Opposition on matters on which both wanted to agree. I was a little disappointed that something like this should take place without having had any contacts from the Treasury. A message may have gone astray, but I cannot find any contact from the Treasury until after the Bill was published.<br><br>
I accept that there was no need to discuss with the Opposition clause 88 and the schedule, which concede something that we had pressed on the Treasury. We were generally concerned that the Government were trying to slough off responsibility and that there was a risk that in future they would shelter behind the Inland Revenue. I accept that that was not the Chief Secretary's intention, but he must understand why we were suspicious and concerned.<br><br>
I suggest that it might be a good idea in future to have a discussion on this rather unusual subject. It is not often that we achieve a consensus on such issues. That was illustrated by the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) when he generously withdrew an amendment that I am sure he would have won in a Division.<br><br>
I hope that the Chief Secretary will take those words in the spirit in which they were intended, and I shall drop my opposition to the clause on the assurance that he has given us this evening.</span></p>

Clause 90</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND INVESTMENT BANK: EXEMPTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to probe the Government on the clause. I have not tabled any amendments, but I am sure that the Minister will explain the clause. As we understand it, clause 90 provides for exemption from income tax, capital transfer tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty in respect of securities issued by the European Community and the European Investment Bank. Why, and what is the cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a reasonable pair of questions. Section 126 of the Finance Act 1984 provides an enabling power to grant certain limited tax exemptions for securities issued by international organisations of which the United Kingdom is a member. Because of the detailed way in which it is drafted, section 126 does not apply to securities issued by the European Communities, which are not technically bodies corporate or bodies of persons which would qualify under the provision that we introduced last year.<br><br>
The second reason is that the European Communities may want to issue some stock in this country in sterling rather than issue it in some other centre outside this country in Euro-sterling. We do not want to stop them using our market. All member states grant these exemptions to the European Communities on the same basis that they do to international bodies. Until now, there has not been any prospect that the European Communities might want to issue in that way.<br><br>
No cost will be involved because, if we do not grant those exemptions which are standard for international bodies, they will not issue any stock here, and they have not done so in the past.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the clause be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
When we discussed clauses 74 and 75 earlier, I mentioned the contents of new clause 24. These adjustments would have been made to clauses 74 and 75 by an ordinary amendement if it were not for the peculiar characteristic of stamp duty and the fact that we have a separate starting date—1 August, in this case. If hon. Members wish me to elaborate, I shall be glad to do so, but I think that I mentioned the main points at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would take a few moments to explain the new clause. As I said in our earlier debate, I did not wish to discuss the matter then because it was not included in the group of amendments selected by the Chairman. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary will take this opportunity to explain exactly what changes the new clause will introduce into the Bill.</span></p>
<p>11.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I referred only briefly to the changes, it is right for me to comment further.<br><br>
The clause makes five changes to the reliefs. Two of the changes are in respect of where an acquiring company takes over a target company's loan capital as well as its equity capital. Since 1976, ordinary loan capital and debentures have been exempted from stamp duty, but there are a few special types of loan capital, such as those where the return on loan capital is geared to the performance of a company, which for technical reasons were not covered by that exemption. There is no reason to exclude them, so one of the changes deals with that.<br><br>
Another change deals with the fact that the owners of such loan stock are not shareholders. Technically, because of the way in which clause 74 is phrased, it deals with the shareholders in the second company when they could also be the stockholders. The third change is similar. In some companies, the technical term for capital that is acquired is stock rather than shares. Therefore, technically, the owners are stockholders rather than shareholders. There is a technical difference between stock, which can be subdivided and is expressed in amounts of money, and shares—the more usual and modern commodity—which provide a company with capital. However, there is no substantive difference in the way in which stocks and shares are treated. The third change is to make the provision
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0840">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 575</span>
comprehensive by referring to stockholders and to shareholders.<br><br>
The fourth change ensures that a relief provided by clause 74 operates where the dissenting minority's shares are acquired. For example, company A might make an offer for company B, but some of the shareholders of company B might not respond. If company A obtains more than 90 per cent of the shares, it is empowered under the Companies Act to acquire the outstanding balance. Often, that happens because the shareholders cannot be traced and therefore could not respond to the offer. In those circumstances, the shares in company A would be issued in trust for the shareholders of company B who have not directly responded. If the shareholders claim the shares, they can have them. Technically, the shares in company A are not issued to the shareholders of company B—the provision in clause 74. The change merely allows for that circumstance.<br><br>
The final change is the main one. It extends the relief to when the shares of the acquiring company— company A—are sold on to a third party by the shareholders of company B. Because of the way in which such operations sometimes are organised, there would be two lots of stamp duty. The change is made for technical reasons because the shares would be issued to the shareholders of company B and passed on to an issuing house or a merchant bank, which as part of the offer would have undertaken to provide cash. However, the provision of cash deprives the company of obtaining the benefit for exemption because cash transfers involve stamp duty. The merchant bank or issuing house would place the shares with institutions or other investors, when there would be a second stamp duty charge.<br><br>
Although it has several stages, for all practical purposes, the transaction is a single one. Stamp duty is chargeable, but the Revenue judges that stamp duty should be charged only once. There are several ways in which that can be done. There is no intention of trying to compel those involved in such transactions to use a method whereby only one charge would be netted. The change will avoid a double charge when shares are passed on to a third party.<br><br>
Those are the changes in the new clause. They operate from 1 August.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary makes it sound as though the amendments introduced by the new clause are technicalities. He used the word "technical" several times.<br><br>
Can he say what is the additional cost of the amendments represented by the new clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By "technical" I did not mean to imply that there was not some substance, too. I meant that the amendments were technical consequences of what had been done in 1974; I was not trying to say that they were drafting amendments. I hope that by using the word "technical", I did not give that impression.<br><br>
The cost of the new clause is negligible. The assumption is that if the last change that I mentioned concerning sale to third parties was not introduced, most bodies involved would try to find another structural means of doing the same transaction to avoid two lots of stamp duty. There might be a few cases—it would be impossible to quantify—but the number would be small.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I should briefly explain that as more and more businesses keep their records on computers, the various powers that were originally devised for Customs and Excise in relation to documents, books and accounts do not cover the range of records to which any modern Administration would need access in the special circumstances where there might be a dispute about the liabilities of VAT.<br><br>
The matter was raised in the Finance Bill Committee on 1 July 1980, but more recently it has been the subject of consideration by the Keith committee. That committee made a recommendation that is largely embodied in the new clause, which is designed to give Customs and Excise access in a reasonable manner, at a reasonable place, and at a reasonable time, to the computer records of a firm, and in special situations require the reasonable assistance of the registered trader for access and operation of the computer itself.<br><br>
It is not our intention to arm Customs and Excise with unnecessary or excessive and oppressive powers. I hope that we have struck the balance right between the interests of the registered trader and those of Customs and Excise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a couple of questions that I want to ask the Minister on the new clause.<br><br>
First, I refer the Minister to a letter that Opposition Members have received from the executive secretary of the Wine and Spirits Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland dated 30 May 1985. I thought it appropriate to read to the Committee a part of that letter about VAT in the context of the Keith committee's recommendation.<br><br>
The executive secretary says that there is
<br><blockquote><p>"neither a legal justification nor a Parliamentary wish for the powers sought to be extended to include VAT. Traditionally, the Department has had no interest in products as soon as any duties liability on them has been discharged. We see no reason to change that situation."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister comment on that sentiment?<br><br>
I refer the Committee to the second part of the new clause. In subsection (2)(b)(ii) the Government propose that any person authorised by the commissioners may require<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 578</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"any person having charge of, or otherwise concerned with the operation of, the computer, apparatus or material"</p></blockquote>
to afford him reasonable assistance. I am worried about that part of the new clause as it can embrace many interested parties. There is the user organisation itself. There could be the manufacturers of the equipment. The designers of the equipment could also be involved, as could software houses and all and sundry.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 of the letter from the Wine and Spirits Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst we do not object to the Keith Committee's recommendation relating to computer access, the wine and imported spirits Trades would not permit the Department's representatives to have full 'hands-on' control unless the company concerned were to be indemnified fully in each case and instance against loss or damage to the machine, its support systems and software."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable point. If we allow the Customs and Excise to invoke this power and thereby involve all and sundry, a complex and fragile system could crash, files could be lost and it could cost the company concerned a considerable amount. Is the Minister prepared, in conjunction with those powers, to indemnify the company against the loss that could ensue from that kind of involvement?<br><br>
The type of inquiries and electronic documents that one would wish to access from the computer could be more than the normal reports. Any VAT inquiry could involve an audit trail. That means that special reporting could be required. That could render the system extremely susceptible to damage such as file damage. I would appreciate it if the Minister would respond to that point.<br><br>
I should like to refer the Chief Secretary to subsection (2)(a). I appreciated his comments about not wanting to introduce oppressive powers; he used the word "reasonable". I am sure that this is the motive behind the provision. However, the subsection says that any person authorised by the commissioner
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be entitled at any reasonable time to have access to, and inspect and check the operation of, any computer and any associated apparatus or material which is or has been in use in connection with any document to which this subsection applies".</p></blockquote>
The Wine and Spirits Association is concerned about access and I have already quoted from the letter from the executive secretary about that. Access and what is reasonable should be defined precisely, because it could cause considerable concern to many companies.<br><br>
11.30 p.m.<br><br>
The other question concerns time, and what is a reasonable time. In the retrieval of documents from a company's computer system, a time that is acceptable to the staff of the Customs and Excise might coincide, for example, with the company's year-end run or period-end run, when people are very busy. Will the Minister confirm that in the defining of "reasonable time", consideration will be given to the company's computer schedule, which would show the peaks and troughs of activity, and that that would entail part of the definition of reasonableness?<br><br>
Finally, may I quote press notice No. 1003 of 30 April from Customs and Excise on the subject of the Keith committee report. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Keith Committee Report recommended that Customs and Excise should be entitled at any reasonable time … to have access to and check the working of a computer … to use … the computer facilities themselves … and … to receive assistance from the staff in charge of the computer."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 579</span>
The next paragraph says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The draft clause extends the last requirement to include the producer or manufacturer of the computer, apparatus or material".</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister feel that that extension of the requirement should include the designers of the system, in addition to the producer or manufacturer?<br><br>
Computer systems are becoming increasingly complicated. Some systems involve the storage of files in different countries. For example, the files of the Honeywell timesharing system, which is used by companies in this country, are kept in the United States or in various parts of the world. So when one sits at a computer, one has access to something outside the country. Will the Chief Secretary tell us what powers the Customs and Excise will have to explore the internal workings of files where international boundaries are involved?<br><br>
At this late hour of the evening, I may not have been at my most coherent, but I hope that I have made it clear that there are certain risks. The system is complicated. Perhaps the Minister will reply to the questions that I have put to him about access, time and assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timothy Wood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stevenage)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I commend the Government for having responded to the comments about Customs and Excise press notice 1003, which was touched on by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall). Many computer manufacturers were concerned about the original wording of the new clause, but I believe that it now meets their objections. It is important to distinguish between the assistance being sought by operators and programme staff, and so on, and the original implications of the clause as it related to the company from which the information was sought; manufacturers would have had to give what they might regard as confidential information about their clients.<br><br>
I believe that the present drafting is as reasonable as it could be, especially in view of what the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said. Those who have charge of a computer or are involved in other ways should provide the necessary information and assistance. However, there is the problem relating to legal rights and access in respect of files held overseas. Perhaps my right honourable and learned Friend the Chief Secretary will comment on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the fraud aspect. For example, someone in charge of a computer could wipe out information knowing that an inquiry was coming, and then explain that doing so was standard policy. In other words, when officers of the Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise arrived, the information would no longer be there. I do not feel that new clause 25 has anything to say about that, but no doubt if the intention could be proved, a prosecution would follow. Certain information must be stored and available, but would it be comprehensive enough to help the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise in their investigations? Perhaps the Chief Secretary will tell us whether such matters are covered.<br><br>
The new clause talks of "level 4", which I suppose relates to a maximum fine of, say, £1,000. But is that sufficient, when the obstruction may involve millions of pounds? Perhaps larger penalties should be available to the courts, relating to the seriousness of the offence. After all, a fraud involving £1 million is much more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
serious than one of only £50 or £100. I am not at all sure that the new clause has got matters right in that respect. Perhaps the Chief Secretary can reassure me.<br><br>
Casting my mind back to a year or so ago, I recall that Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue were given certain powers of access, via the Data Protection Act 1984, to computers and data. I hope that there is nothing contradictory between the provisions of the Act and this clause. I am sure that the Government have considered the matter.<br><br>
My main concern is that the Data Protection Act is inadequate as regards statutory regulation and control. If the Government think that all is well regarding computers, they labour under a misapprehension, because the Act is too weak in many respects, and it may be too weak in this respect.<br><br>
I recall the good point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) regarding data stored overseas. I do not know what the Act provides for that. I know that there is something in its principles about sending data overseas, but it is vague and there is little regulation. There are many questions to be asked and I hope that the Chief Secretary will answer at least some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Bright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the reason for the introduction of the new clause. I should like to associate myself with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall). Questions will remain in the back of people's minds about whether the Revenue will come in and want to run an audit trail on a computer.<br><br>
There are dozens of different types of computers, one of which is concerned with small businesses, which do not necessarily use the normal, everyday computer. All sorts of small contraptions work in small businesses, upwards from the small Sinclair. Many of the programs that they use are put together on an ad hoc basis. There are hundreds of programs which, when altered and tinkered with, result in thousands. It is possible for a person who is up against a modified program to do the wrong thing and cause a crash, thus losing valuable information for that company.<br><br>
A company may have invested in something like a Winchester disk system, which has everything, and will not use floppies. It would be possible to wipe out the whole of a company's records—stock control, the lot—in one go.<br><br>
Many small firms' personnel might be completely innocent of how the system works. I speak with authority on that. My business has a computer which mystifies me terribly. We know roughly what to do and can follow the book and put the information in, but often it is necessary to call in the programmers because only they know how to extract the information without scrubbing off or spoiling the records within the system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right as regards small businesses. Large businesses keep most things in duplicate, so the problem will not rise.</span></p>
<p>11.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am making the point in regard to small businesses. Obviously, that problem will not exist in a large business because it will probably have a set system and staff who are able not only to operate the machine but to dig deep into the system, pick up the audit trails and give all the necessary information.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0843">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
I merely warn that I foresee problems in this area, and I wonder whether all aspects have been fully covered in the new clause. If a small or medium sized business suffers damage because it is asked to retrieve or take something out of a system and an operator does not quite understand what is required, who is to blame? I believe that an indemnity should be given when that happens or that arrangements should be made so that the right person is called in to produce that particular piece of information. I am most worried about small businesses because of the complexities of computer systems, as there is no overall norm. I am sure that the most experienced person from the Revenue could well be faced, on a fairly regular basis, with a system which he has never seen and does not understand. Furthermore, the person who operates the system may not understand it properly. The last thing I want is for people to be held responsible for ruining files, causing a deal of damage and imposing great costs on firms— especially on small firms. Therefore, I ask for assurance on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Members for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and my hon. Friends the Members for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) and for Stevenage (Mr. Wood), I have a couple of queries about the new clause. Clearly, a new clause of this nature is not only necessary but will become increasingly necessary as the different and more specialised use of computers in businesses and among VAT taxpayers increases. Nevertheless, some of the questions that have been asked in the Committee may have arisen because the new clause is relatively newly born. It had a short consultation period of one month with the industry and other users and it is perhaps not surprising that queries still abound.<br><br>
I draw the attention of my right honourable and learned Friend to the effects of new clause 52(2)(b)(ii) on the industry, and I wish to point out two instances where the new clause gives rise to worries within it. Quite rightly, it empowers the Customs and Excise to obtain the information which is needed to enable it to carry out its functions, but it brings in third parties who may have nothing to do, at the time when they are brought in, with either the taxpayer or the Customs and Excise. It would appear that the new clause empowers the Customs and Excise to demand what may be highly technical and complex services of the third party without payment for them.<br><br>
I refer in particular to a major employer in my constituency, the firm of Hewlett-Packard Ltd, which, understandably, fears that should the Customs and Excise require a system to be cracked and, for some reason, the writer of the software is not available, inevitably the Customs and Excise will turn to the manufacturer for advice. As relatively few manufacturers trade in this country, the severe cost of such technical advice and program cracking could fall on them.<br><br>
The second worry is about the smaller end of the scale. If a specialised software house has written a detailed programme for a particular VAT taxpayer, it will frequently work on the basis of assignments which last for a number of months at a time. Time is frequently of the essence on such assignments.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
If the powers given to Customs and Excise in subsection (2)(b)(ii) need to be applied—I take the point made by my right honourable and learned Friend that the powers will be applied only exceptionally—to bring in a specialist software house to elucidate a programme, it could cause a great deal of cost and inconvenience to that software house. While I accept my right honourable and learned Friend's assurance that the powers proposed in the new clause will be used only with a great deal of discretion, we are being asked to give those powers to Customs and Excise without putting any duty upon that Department to compensate third parties for what may be considerable costs in the exercise of those powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and important debate. Points of considerable significance have been raised on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
There is a delicate balance to be struck between the interests of Customs and Excise and the interests of the registered trader. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) preceptively remarked, this clause is newly minted and deals with a developing field. Whatever the outcome of tonight's debate, the Government and the House will wish to pay special attention to it as developments occur.<br><br>
I shall endeavour to deal with the points raised by the Committee. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) who was leading the debate for the Opposition quoted the Wine and Spirits Association which said that there is neither legal justification nor parliamentary wish for this measure. The hon. Gentleman promptly remarked that it was for us rather than an outside body to interpret the parliamentary wish in Committee or on the Floor of the House. However, one would not wish to say hard things about an important body.<br><br>
As regards the legal justification, the Committee will have seen that the powers are limited to assigned matters and they are defined in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, in section 1(1). "Assigned matter" means any matter in relation to which the Commissioners are for the time being required in pursuance of any enactment to perform any duties. It is clear that the powers can be exercised only in regard to duties which both Houses of Parliament have imposed on Customs and Excise and charged its officers to perform. Those officers cannot go off on a frolic of their own. It is not for me to speculate about the legal consequences, but if they did they would be acting intra vires.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman and some of my hon. Friends were worried about the scope of the measure and about people who might come within the ambit of the powers. They asked whether all and sundry would be included. I hope not. I hope that we have drawn a reasonably tight target area. It emerged from interventions from both sides of the Committee that hon. Gentlemen are especially concerned about subsection (2)(b)(ii) which may require a defined category of person
<br><blockquote><p>"to afford him such reasonable assistance as he—"</p></blockquote>
the duly authorised Customs Officer—
<br><blockquote><p>"may require for the purposes of paragraph (a) above."</p></blockquote>
I shall deal first with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West about third parties. We are very anxious about that matter. We are basing the clause on a specific recommendation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0844">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
the Keith committee. However, when one attempts to translate a recommendation from however distinguished a body, tactical difficulties emerge—for the record, the paragraph in the Keith committee to which I refer is paragraph 34.6.16. I am happy to give an unqualified assurance that this clause will not be used to require assistance from any third party. We had hoped that the clause would be drafted so that it covered that point, but it has so far defeated us. We want to think a little more deeply about the matter. I cannot give an unqualified assurance that we can bring it forward on Report but we shall certainly return to it in later Finance Bills. That is why I give this assurance now. Because the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West is especially concerned, I repeat my unqualified assurance that the clause will not be used to require assistance from any third parties. I hope that the matter is clearly defined by
<br><blockquote><p>"any person having charge of, or otherwise concerned with the operation of, the computer, apparatus or material".</p></blockquote>
We shall examine it again with an open mind, taking into account the comments of this evening's debate.<br><br>
I was asked to define the scope of "at any reasonable time" in subsection (2)(a). It would defeat me at this hour of the night to instance all the circumstances that might be reasonable or unreasonable. Opposition Members have reservations about the intervention of the courts on such matters but it is not for a Minister to attempt to act in a judicial fashion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West cited a particular instance and I was struck by the practical force of what he said. It is not for me to anticipate the courts' rulings, but I imagine that the kind of combination of circumstances that the hon. Gentleman mentioned would have to be taken into account in deciding whether the time was reasonable. If there is any doubt we are prepared to come back on Report.<br><br>
There is a cautionary word to be uttered on this issue and it was uttered by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). How does one prevent the unscrupulous registered trader from scrubbing off the computer or from making it impossible for the Customs and Excise to pursue its legitimate inquiries? Striking that balance is a matter of considerable delicacy. I commend the clause with resonable humility to the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked about the obligation on a registered trader to keep records. Schedule 7 extends the period from three to six years. There is a £1,000 fine for obstructing an officer in subsection (4) of the new clause. For the destruction of evidence, after Royal Assent a civil penalty will replace the criminal law. Clause 16(2) provides for a fine of up to £500.<br><br>
That figure may sound derisory and I see the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West pursing his lips. It is not for me to speculate what he wishes to convey to me. In case the hon. Gentleman feels that that is too light a penalty and lest anyone should draw the wrong conclusions from my remarks, proceedings for fraud might be involved in serious cases. We are mindful of the points that have been raised.<br><br>
Hon. Members from both sides of the Committee asked about damage to computers and to records. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright), who has an enviable reputation for his desire to protect the interests of small businesses, raised this point, as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
did the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West and other hon. Members. Again, there is a delicate balance to be struck, and that is why we introduced subsection (2)(b), which requires someone other than a third party to afford "such reasonable assistance" as the customs officer requires. It is in the registered trader's interest that he should operate the computer and extract for the Customs and Excise the kind of information legitimately required.<br><br>
The Customs and Excise are not quite the heavy handed people that fiction and sometimes hon. Gentlemen portray. There are about 500 specialised computer experts and thousands with a good, working knowledge of computers. Nevertheless, we recognise the sensitivities of the registered trader. That is why it is much better to have co-operation between Customs and Excise and the registered trader in the operation of the computer and the extraction of information from it.<br><br>
12 midnight<br><br>
I hope that I have covered all the points raised. This is a new power in a developing area. We are basing it on the recommendation of the Keith committee, but it would be very brash to assert boldly that we had got it right first time. We shall naturally keep the power under close review, as I am sure will Opposition Members. If there is any way in which we can improve it before Report, we shall endeavour to do so. Failing that we can always return to it later.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will see that we have made an honest and, I trust, reasonably successful endeavour to balance the interests of Customs and Excise and taxpayer. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are in a dilemma. The objective of the clause is laudable and we understand that it is crucial that Customs and Excise have powers comparable to those which it has for paper documents for computer systems. However, the attempt to interpret the Keith report and to take this step have not been handled satisfactorily. The clause is woolly and does not stand up to strutiny.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Luton, South (Mr. Bright) made some excellent points. On third parties he said that there should be a way of indemnifying small companies—although it could involve large companies with old accounting systems and computers which wobble when touched.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) mentioned compensation for the trader in the event of damage from action emanating from a third party. That is a matter of great concern. As the hon. Gentleman said the clause does cause worries.<br><br>
I noted with interest what the Chief Secretary said about third parties. Customs and Excise press notice 1003 makes it clear what thinking lies behind this provision. It was intended to open up the area to third parties. I am sure that the Chief Secretary would admit that. It was intended to prise the whole issue open, quite understandably, to give Customs and Excise reasonable powers to ensure that there is no abuse and that all the VAT that should be paid by traders is paid. The drafting of the new clause shows that that was the intention. Therefore, we should reject it.<br><br>
In answer to my "all and sundry" argument, the Chief Secretary said he felt that the new clause had defined a tight target area. I do not understand that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
As I said at the outset, we are not necessarily talking about a tight target area, and if this measure became part of our statute, I fear that it would not be sustainable.<br><br>
Finally, let me reply to what the Chief Secretary said in response to the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) about unscrupulous traders destroying files. It could, of course, happen. If Customs and Excise officials visited a company, such traders might change all the sticky labels on the files on those little machines—I do not use them myself—and carry out all sorts of activities to abuse the system and avoid paying the VAT that they should be paying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend suggesting that the terms of the new clause are not definite enough to stop such abuse? Would he like to see it toughened up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some respects it could be tighter. The Chief Secretary has not responded to what I said about the international situation, for instance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have no powers to enforce such a provision outside the United Kingdom. It is an inevitable consequence of domestic laws that few of them will enforce the revenue laws of another country unless there happens to be a mutual assistance clause in some double tax convention—a point which was also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Mr. Wood).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for what he has said about a matter that I was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
uncertain about, I fear that there is a loophole which could provide an incentive for unscrupulous traders to embark on strategies to abuse the system. I believe that although the intent is good, the new clause does not stand up to scrutiny, and that we should reject it for reasons unconnected with party politics.</span></p>
