<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the drafting of this new clause is sufficiently tight for the Government to consider making this concession, and tight enough to exclude misuse by making a double tax claim on contributions to pension schemes. I understand that we may not have succeeded in our purpose, but I hope that we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give some of the background. In the early 1980s, and by 1982, the employer and trade union organisations in the building and construction industry had negotiated a lump sum retirement benefit scheme to provide an industry-wide retirement benefit for its workers. The scheme took account of the highly mobile and casual nature of employment in the construction industry. Such a scheme could only be an advance on anything that had gone before in an industry where employment conditions are notoriously poor, The employers and trade unions were anxious to ensure that the scheme continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the scheme form part of the standard terms and conditions of employment for building and civil engineering workers employed under the national working rules, which are agreed by employers and trade unions. The scheme is run in conjunction with the industry's "holidays with pay" arrangements. It includes a "death in service" benefit, and it is called the building and civil engineering benefit scheme. Currently it covers about 500,000 workers, of whom between 350,000 and 400,000 are active members, and they are employed by about 15,000 participating employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme, which began in April 1982, is not contracted out of the state earnings-related arrangements. It provides a modest lump sum payment on retirement, based on the worker's weeks of construction industry service from the commencement date, multiplied by a
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
retirement benefit rate. Employers pay weekly contributions, the level of which is determined jointly by both sides of the industry. The retirement benefit rate is determined by the trustees acting on actuarial advice, and any increase is subject to the prior approval of the Superannuation Funds Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Benefit is payable, whether or not the worker is still employed in the construction industry, on his 65th birthday, and the benefit rate is that applicable at the date of retirement, irrespective of the worker's circumstances at that date. In this way cover and preservation for early leavers, who are not penalised if they leave the industry permanently or temporarily, is provided. Workers do not contribute to the scheme, but it is an approved arrangement under the Finance Act 1970. The fact that workers do not contribute to the scheme has given rise to part of the problem. Clearly, such a scheme is necessary because people go in and out of the building industry, depending on the work available. Obviously it is more difficult for the older workers to obtain work and, curiously enough, the more skilled a worker is at his trade, the more difficult it can be to find reasonably well paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is exceptional and designed to deal with the industry-wide problem of the employment of a large and rapidly changing labour force. It does not provide a pension, and after 40 years' service the lump sum would amount to no more than the annual wage current at the date of retirement. The lump sum payable on retirement is often small—only a few hundred pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the scheme was introduced in April 1982, several workers had the section 226 policy on which tax relief was given on the annual premium. However, the Inland Revenue classifies that scheme as a sponsored superannuation scheme for the purpose of section 226 of the Taxes Act 1970. That ruling means that individual building and civil engineering workers are no longer eligible to pay, or to continue to pay, contributions on retirement annuity contracts. That gives rise to the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know how many workers are contributing to the personal retirement annuity contracts—that is an opportunity that is now denied to them. It is thought that only a small proportion of the total work force is affected by this, but the construction industry thinks that this interpretation of the 1970 Act is most unjust in that it discourages workers from making further retirement provision. They do not get a pension, but only this small lump sum paid on retirement. The building industry seeks a limited concession for these workers because it needs to provide some industry-wide coverage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no contributions to the scheme from operatives, and so it seems unreasonable to deny a worker who will benefit from this scheme tax relief on any personal pension plans that he may make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sought to ensure that the new clause was drawn as tightly as possible, but I understand that there has been considerable discussion on it between the industry and the Inland Revenue, and that the Inland Revenue hoped that it would be possible to bring forward an amendment which the Government would accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there may be two reasons for this hesitation. The Government are planning to change pension schemes in general, and it may be necessary to wait for that. Alternatively, the Inland Revenue may be hesitant to introduce an amendment that could allow people tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
relief on more than one pension scheme. I understand that hesitation. That is why we have drawn the new clause in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal may not be successful, and the Minister may consider that it will not be successful. If so, perhaps he will consider and find a solution to the problem for building workers of being in and out of work and working for one employer, then another, often in unsatisfactory conditions, without decent pension or holiday pay provisions, a problem that does not face such a large number of workers in other industries. Employers should produce some basic scheme—it does not seem an enormous amount—for their employees when they reach retirement. It would give them some protection, and I am pleased that the industry and the unions have succeded in coming to agreement on a scheme of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should look sympathetically at the problems of the building industry and find some way to ensure fair treatment for building workers without opening up loopholes for others to use. The Minister has heard enough from the Opposition to know that we do not favour tax avoidance loopholes of any kind, and are only too anxious to assist in closing them. I trust that the Minister will look at the problems of the building industry and ensure that the new clause, or some suitable version of it, is accepted to protect this superannuation scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Eggar 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Enfield, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first, Miss Fookes, apologise for not having been present during the debate and for having to leave early to hear the wind-up speeches on the Floor of the House as I spoke there earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to declare my interest as a taxation adviser to the Building Employers Confederation, and in doing so to reinforce the remarks made by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) in support of the proposal that I think originally emanated from UCATT. She was right to say that there is agreement between the unions and the employers about the benefits of the scheme, and the desirability of overcoming an unfortunate mistake. It was found that due to a misunderstanding the employers had placed their operatives in the wrong position. They found that if their operatives were members of the scheme they were not entitled to the benefits under section 226 to which they would otherwise have been entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unions and the employers have considered a number of ways of getting round the problem, and I believe that the Financial Secretary suggested a method using AVCs—added voluntary contributions. My hon. Friend may not be aware that that possibility is being examined by the employers now. It is extremely complex, administratively and otherwise. If the Revenue can come forward with some wording—ideally this year—avoiding the necessity for using AVCs it would be highly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a solution may not be possible, and my hon. Friend may feel that he cannot make progress this year. Like the hon. Member for Thurrock I understand that it could lead to complications. If that is so, I hope that my hon. Friend will give a clear undertaking that the Government will act when they come to introduce the necessary legislation on pension reform and changes in
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
pension systems which will inevitably follow from the social security Green Paper. Whatever may be our view of that Green Paper we know that there is bound to be legislation on pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that tonight my hon. Friend will be able at the very least to give an assurance that the problems of the building industry will be picked up and that legislation will be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to hear the words of the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar). Unfortunately, by virtue of section 226, a person who should be entitled to these benefits is not getting them when he receives a one-off golden handshake, and would not qualify on an annuity for relief of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways of tackling the problem. Either we can accept a new clause here, or wait for some legislation to emanate from the reviews of which we have heard so much. I hope that the Government will take up the case of the building workers. This is a genuine anomaly, and people are suffering unnecessarily as a result of it. I fully support the hon. Member for Enfield, North. He has made representations and has proceeded in the most constructive and useful way and the building industry thinks highly of what he has done. I hope that the Minister will pursue the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the unusual position of having the federation and UCATT singing from the same hymn sheet, which is to be encouraged. I am anxious that the Government should take that point on board. There is a considerable desire on both sides of the building industry to clear up the anomaly. Opposition Members can speak for themselves. I do not want to imply that my view reflects theirs but I hope that there will be strong support for the idea, either through the new clause presented so ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) or through subsequent legislation. I shall be interested to hear what the Economic Secretary has to say on what I regard as a serious anomaly. I hope that we can obtain something to overcome the problem under section 226 and the way in which these annuities are being taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is no to the new clause but yes to a great deal of the rest of what was said by the hon. Members for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald), and for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) and my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar). I shall not run through the technicalities of the problem because they were so admirably set out by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right for us to introduce a provision in legislation here and now, regardless of whether the new clause was technically correct. The whole question of portable pensions, which overlap with retirement benefit annuities, is under review and there will be legislation on it. I cannot say when the legislation will be introduced but when we prepare it we shall take into account the problem described by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that several members of the industry are disadvantaged by the specific arrangements applying under the building and civil engineering benefits scheme. It was a pity that that aspect of the scheme
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
was not checked out in 1982 and that members were not advised of it. I am sure that the omission was inadvertent but the consequence is that if workers receive a benefit from their employers under the provision, they are debarred from receiving the 17.5 per cent relief on contributions to a retirement annuity. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West raised that point. The other benefits of retirement annuities such as the tax-free build-up will still be available. Only the contributions to them are affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several ways round the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North mentioned the AVCs route. It may be possible to deal with the technicalities of that solution, which would mean that early retirement could be provided for within the scheme. If so, the contributions would qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Members in contact with those who support the new clause to consider carefully the other possibility. If employees were allowed to opt out of the scheme they could benefit from the tax relief on their contributions to the separate retirement benefit annuity scheme. As the hon. Member for Thurrock said, at this stage the retirement benefits of the existing scheme are modest—a few hundred pounds at most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interim it will probably be more advantageous for members of the scheme who want to establish a reasonably-sized provision for retirement to get the 17.5 per cent on the contributions for a more substantial retirement than to have the limited benefit in relation to a small sum for retirement out of a scheme which was originally designed for holiday pay and sickness benefit rather than for retirement. That is a calculation of the relative benefits until the matter is sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That aspect was raised not only by the Revenue in discussions, but in correspondence a couple of years ago between by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, who at the time was Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers), who had raised the matter. My right honourable Friend said that he hoped that it would be possible to deal with it through AVCs, but that
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it is not practicable to solve the difficulty by allowing members to pay voluntary contributions to purchase more benefit, is it perhaps possible to give operatives the option to be excluded from the retirement benefit provisions of the scheme? The Revenue confirm that it is no requirement of theirs that employees must be members of tax approved schemes operated by their employers."</p></blockquote>
As far as I know, the Revenue has no objection to a suspension of the retirement benefit provisions for the small percentage of members of the scheme who want to make more substantial retirement provision on their own. I say that in the interval between now and the time when we take the matter into account in legislation to cover the whole subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However narrow the new clause may be, it presents difficulties because it covers an area in which others are also interested. It is a problem in specific legislation of this kind. I do not believe that it would be possible to introduce a special provision for building workers, when farm workers have a similar scheme and a potentially similar problem, and there are probably others, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall consider not only the problems of building workers but the general problem. We shall take into account what has been said in this debate, and I hope that account of what I have said will be taken as a way to ameliorate the problem in the interim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister replied sympathetically, but his reply did not meet all the points. I accept that the Government are in a quandary with the problem of portable pensions, the review of the state earnings-related pension scheme, and the introduction of new pension schemes. But legislation on that is not expected to take effect until 1987, and that is two years away. Some workers in the industry may have retired by then—they are now approaching retirement—and they would have to wait another two years before they could expect any relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to what the Minister said about additional voluntary contributions, the employers' anxiety is that they would make the present scheme more complex to administer, especially with the control of contribution and benefit levels that would then be required by the Inland Revenue. The proposal does not deal with the difficulties of existing individual retirement annuity contracts held by men who are also likely to benefit from the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the advice that the Minister gave to individuals. I appreciate that people could withdraw from the scheme and make their own arrangements, but given the history of workers in the building industry, I think it is about time that employers made arrangements for holiday pay—not that that is covered in our present discussion—for retirement benefit, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A worker in the building industry may suffer a lifetime of casual work and extremely casual treatment. The qualities of highly skilled workers are often not respected in terms of the pay that they receive or any other consideration, and the person who can put bricks on top of each other the fastest is likely to earn the most. Given that the employment conditions of building and construction workers have suffered in every possible way until very recently—and there is still a great deal to be done to improve them—a scheme negotiated by the unions in which the employers contribute to their long-term benefit is surely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition recognise the difficulties, and we certainly do not want to open up opportunities for tax avoidance. The Minister mentioned farm workers, but I do not think that most of them now suffer from the same casual treatment as building and construction workers, who often work on short contract. When the contract ends, that is it: they are out of work and have to look somewhere else. Special considerations apply to the building industry, and I am sorry that the Minister feels unable to find a way around the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a temporary measure; it need only apply for the next two years. We want to provide relief until the Government legislation is in place—presumably in about the spring of about 1987, although it cannot be guaranteed to stay in place for long after that, because we shall probably undo a great deal of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

relief. It is not now possible to obtain relief for a tax loss partly as group relief and partly as consortium relief. For example, where a consortium company makes a loss it can surrender it up to other members of the consortium by way of consortium relief, or down to its subsidiaries by group relief. In either case the surrender may be for part or all of the losses. However, a consortium company cannot surrender part of its loss up to consortium members and part of it down to the subsidiaries on group relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar situation arises where a consortium member makes a loss. That loss can be surrendered by way of group relief to other companies in the same group or by way of consortium relief down to the consortium company, but that canot be surrendered partly by consortium relief and partly by group relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That restriction is both illogical and unnecessary. Furthermore, it can lead to real hardship where there are insufficient profits to relieve the loss solely by group relief or solely by consortium relief, and part of the losses may have to go unrelieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consortium is of considerable commercial importance. Equipment leasing, major construction projects, cable television, shipping, electronics and space development are just some of the vital industries that can depend on the consortium's structure. Many highly successful developments have taken place through a consortium. Indeed, many new projects are of such a scale that they can be financed only through a consortium but it is not fanciful to think that consortia or their subsidiaries will not make tax losses and there fore will require the opportunity to seek relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 is a fairly straightforward way of correcting the anomaly that I have outlined. New clause 5 is an alternative method that is slightly more complicated. Either way, there is an unjustifiable anomaly that will be potentially harmful to the development of the whole principle of consortia. I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that point when he responds to the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may intervene briefly to make sure that we understand what we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present if a consortium has a subsidiary company and the consortium makes a loss, the consortium can surrender that loss to its member companies or to its subsidiary company, but it cannot surrender the loss to both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly puzzled to be told that new clause 5 was an alternative way of dealing with the same problem dealt with in new clause 4. In effect, new clause 4 deals with mixed claims; New clause 5 deals essentially with flows. For example, if the consortium makes a loss and one of its member companies has no profits against which it can set off that loss, the consortium company cannot surrender it to that member company. But there may be other member companies within the group of the member company where there are profits against which the consortium company can surrender its loss. The purpose of new clause 5 is to deal with where the consortium company is surrendering its loss not to the member company but to a company within the group of that member company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see a beautiful simplicity about new clause 30 and the way that it deals with some of the problems of consortium relief, but it is difficult to understand why
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
it would not open up huge areas of potential avoidance. New clause 30 takes the consortium member company's share in either the profits or the loss and treats it as if it were the trade of a separate company, which means that it could be treated in exactly the same way as group relief. In effect there is an abolition of the distinction between consortium and group relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the anomaly to which the hon. Member draws attention. However, one should be careful that when trying to deal with the anomaly whole areas of avoidance are not opened up. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will deal with these matters when he replies. However, what scope is there for avoidance within these clauses? Secondly, what sums of money are we talking about if the clauses are implemented? Thirdly, I should be interested to know who has made representations on these different matters. I can see how cable firms and the like would be interested in this. The essential question seems to be whether we think there is an anomaly or not. When we introduce a mechanism to deal with this will we create more problems than we solve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Moore)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) on his brief but excellent introduction to an area which, as the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) said quite legitimately, is extremely complex. I congratulate the hon. Member for Sedgefield on his analysis of the interlocking dual problems that linger through new clauses 4 and 5 as well as the different kind of attempt in new clause 30 to answer the problems. It would be helpful if I tried to go through carefully this area, which is not only complex but important to the outside world and thereby provided an answer to most of the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year we made major changes to the conditions for consortium relief. We increased the maximum permitted number of member companies in a consortium and allowed some of its members to be individuals or non-resident companies. These changes which were widely welcomed, expanded the scope of consortium relief, but they did not tackle the problems to which my hon. Friends' new clauses draw attention. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) who, sadly, is not a member of the Committee this year has been a persistent and ardent advocate of the consortium relief changes which we are considering tonight. His name is on the original new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present rules, and in contrast to a joint venture undertaken in the form of a partnership, a company jointly owned by a consortium is, like any other company, assessed to tax in its own right. Any profits or losses arising cannot be attributed for tax purposes to the companies which own it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, it is possible, under the group relief provisions, for the current losses and certain other excess reliefs of a jointly owned consortium company to be surrendered to the companies which own it for relief against profits arising concurrently; that is what the hon. Member for Sedgefield was describing and it is known colloquially as "consortium relief. Likewise, the consortium member companies may surrender losses to the jointly owned consortium company if that company itself has profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are two particular limitations at present which can restrict the benefit of these group relief
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
provisions to consortia. Both concern the situation where a company is at the same time in group relationship with one company, and is also either a company jointly owned by a consortium, or is one of the joint owners of such a company. First, if a company of that kind incurs a loss and so on, that loss or other amount may be surrendered either to members of its own group as group relief, or as consortium relief, but not partly as one, and partly as the other. That is the problem addressed by new clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if a member of a jointly owned consortium company cannot use its share of the consortium loss and so on, perhaps because it too has losses, then that share can only be carried forward by the jointly owned consortium company. It cannot "flow through" and be claimed as group relief by other companies in the consortium members' group. Similarly, flow through is not at present permitted in the reverse direction, where the losses arise in the consortium members' group, and it is the jointly owned consortium company which has profits. This is the problem addressed by new clause 5. New clause 30, in turn, is concerned with both problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 seeks to allow "mixed claims", provided the consortium leg of the relationship exists and satisfies the conditions for consortium relief for the whole of the corresponding accounting periods of the claimant and surrendering companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the intention here is to avoid the enormous complications that can arise where a company joins a consortium or group in the same year. It is in these circumstances that we have to be careful not to allow excessive relief. However, this new clause recognises only one part of the problem—the bit which arises when the company becomes a member of the consortium. We are left with the possibility of over-relief in the circumstances where the company becomes a member of a group in the year in which the loss is incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the purpose of the existing rule in section 263, as I am sure that the hon. Member for Sedgefield knows, is to stop a member of a consortium from getting too much relief in the case where it is the jointly owned consortium company which has the losses and where that consortium company itself has a subsidiary with profits. The right result in this situation would be for the consortium member to be entitled to no more than his proportionate share in the overall losses incurred by the jointly owned consortium company and its subsidiary. The new clause—even without its technical defects—does not tackle this need to ensure that too much relief is not given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of new clause 5 is to allow the relevant share of a loss incurred by a company jointly owned by a consortium to "flow through" and be relieved anywhere in the member company's group, and not just by the member company itself. I assume that the intention is also to allow flow through of losses in the reverse direction—where the group companies have losses and the company jointly owned by the consortium has profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the clause has a number of technical defects and does not achieve these results. The anomaly has been identified, but the results sought are not achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 30 seeks to overcome these difficulties
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
by introducing a completely different approach to the taxation of jointly owned consortium companies. Instead of treating the jointly owned company as a person taxable in its own right—which it is—the clause would treat the profits or losses of such a company for tax purposes as accruing to the member companies which own it. These profits or losses would then be treated in the hands of the member companies in the same way as any other profits or losses arising from the companies' own activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has a number of technical defects and does not achieve this result. And in some respects it goes much wider than I am sure my honourable Friend intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, for example, because the appropriate share of the losses of a jointly owned consortia company would be treated as a loss of the member company itself, that loss could be relieved more widely by the member than if it had claimed them instead as group relief. For instance, the losses could be set against profits of the member company arising in the preceding year. By contrast, the group relief provisions, under which losses of one company can be set against the profits of another, allow losses to be relieved only against current profits, and not those of earlier periods. The clause would therefore be inconsistent with the existing group relief provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be other problems, for instance where a member company left the consortium. In these circumstances, any losses attributed to the member company which remained unrelieved at that time would be lost, and, unlike under the present rules, these could not be carried forward by the jointly owned consortium company itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there is a good case in principle for allowing both mixed claims and flow through of losses. But we have to find solutions which ensure that neither too much nor too little relief in total is given, and which also cater for the various further complications that can arise, for example, as a result of the provisions having to apply to different kinds of losses, and as a result of companies joining or leaving groups or consortia part way through their accounting periods. In short, the problems here are those of finding workable solutions that do not involve excessive legislative and administrative complexity. Moreover, it is not possible to consider either of these problems in isolation; we believe they should be considered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, action to implement these proposals will entail adding further legislative and administrative complexity to what is already, technically, a very complex part of the tax code. For this reason, we decided that first priority in this year's Finance Bill had to be given to completing the business tax reforms begun last year and to getting the taxation of capital gains on to a sounder footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have received further representations, notably from those industries where there are large-scale business ventures of the kind referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for which consortium arrangements are appropriate—such as shipping and the emerging cable television industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sedgefield asked about the industries involved. All the main representative bodies,
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
including the CBI, the accountancy bodies, the Institute of Taxation, the General Council of British Shipping, the cable television industry and the equivalent leasing association and the Hundred Group of companies produced representations. I appreciate the way in which the hon. Member for Sedgefield tackled the question and, as a result of the representations and the new clauses, we have decided to act without further delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will be pleased to learn that we shall bring forward proposals on Report, and hon. Members may find it helpful if I explain briefly what we propose so that it can be on the record. It would also help Opposition Members in considering the points raised by the hon. Member for Sedgefield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose two main relaxations to group and consortium relief. Broadly, the first of these will make it possible, subject to certain conditions, for the loss or other amount of a surrendering company to be claimed partly as group relief and partly as consortium relief. That is to say, "mixed claims" will be possible. This will deal with the problem which is the subject of new clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second relaxation will make it possible, subject to certain conditions, for consortium relief which is available to, but which cannot be utilised by, a consortium member to "flow through" to, and be claimed by, another company in that consortium member's group. Similarly, it will be possible for the losses of a company in the consortium member's group to flow through to, and be claimed by, the jointly owned consortium company. This will deal with the problem addressed by new clause 5, and both these relaxations will deal with the main problems new clause 30 is designed to tackle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make these changes possible, however some new rules and some tightening up of certain existing rules will be needed. This is mainly to ensure that no more than the right amount of relief in total is given. In order to avoid excessive legislation and administrative complexity, we also propose that these relaxations should not apply in certain circumstances where the group or consortium leg of the relationship does not exist throughout the relevant accounting period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose that the changes should take effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 August 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall effect of these proposals will be to allow those companies that are, at the same time, in group relationship with one company and consortium relationship with another, greater flexibility in the use of group and consortium relief. This should be particularly helpful to those industries such as shipping and the emerging cable TV industry, which I have mentioned where there are large scale business ventures for which consortium arrangements are appropriate. These changes will complement those we introduced last year in section 46 of the Finance Act 1984 which increased the maximum permitted number of member companies in a consortium, and allowed some of the members to be non-United Kingdom companies or individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sedgefield asked about cost implications. We believe that the cost of the proposals is unlikely to be significant as the rules are designed to ensure that only the right amount of relief is given so that there should be some offset against the cost of the relaxations in the cases where the proposals have a tightening-up effect. In any case, the main effect of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
proposal is to change and advance the timing of the relief for losses rather than to increase the amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend on behalf of the Committee for tabling his new clauses, as they have allowed us to cover an important but complex area of tax law. I look forward to tabling a new clause on Report to match the basic anomalies that my hon. Friend has so ably brought to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hirst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not come as a great surprise to me to learn that there may be technical deficiencies in the drafting of new clauses 4 and 5. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for outlining the source of the many representations made for a change in consortium relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, as with group relief, there has to be the proper consortium relationship throughout the entire accounting period or that the relief is restricted pro rata to the period in which the consortium member is a part of the consortium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I am delighted to learn from my hon. Friend that the Government intend to introduce a clause on Report and I hope that it will have the unanimous backing of the House. It is my intention to seek the Committee's leave to withdraw new clauses 4 and 5, but I cannot speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Mr. Wood) on new clause 30.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this advanced hour, I intend to be brief. As this is my last chance to make a contribution, I hope that it is in order for me to say how much I have enjoyed serving on the Committee and how much I have learnt from contributions from both sides. Opposition Members from the 1983 intake have, by their clarity of argument and skill in debate, justified the claim that 1983 will turn out to be a vintage year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 7 provides an opportunity for a brief debate. I appreciate that in drafting it I have not addressed some of its technicalities, and it may be defective. I wish to cover three aspects—first, what an industrial revenue bond is; secondly, why it will benefit the economy; and, thirdly, what it will cost and how it should be paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it could be more properly termed an industrial development bond rather than an industrial revenue bond, the name by which it has been known in the United States for many years. It is proposed that principally small and medium-sized companies should issue bonds. They are bonds in that they would be secured on the issuers' assets. In the case of weak credits, they would be guaranteed by a third-party institution such as a pension fund or insurance company. In the United States, it is the practice for commercial banks to guarantee the security of bonds through letters of credit, but that arrangement would probably be inappropriate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bonds would be long term in that their maturities would be perhaps 10 years. They are distinct from the traditional way of financing by overdraft which applies to much of industry in this country. The bonds would be largely fixed-rate rather than floating-rate. The interest on them would be free of taxation to the personal recipients, although interest would not be allowed free of tax to institutional or corporate holders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bonds are designed to provide a tax incentive to individuals. Companies that issued bonds would be entitled to deduct the interest cost for the purposes of corporation tax. The coupon benefit—the interest rate benefit—would in practice be shared between the issuing company and the individual lenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practice in the United States is to share the tax benefit approximately equally. Such an arrangement means that if a company could borrow long term in the debenture market at, say, 15 per cent a coupon, the actual issue cost of the tax-free instrument might be, say, 10 per cent. However, there is a serious question mark about whether companies could borrow in that way because we do not have the long-term debt market for small and medium-sized companies that exists in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage that the bonds would be packaged by funds such as banks or Investors in Industry and retailed to individuals. It would not be practical to assume that individual companies could afford to distribute their own bonds broadly in the retail market. The bonds would have to be packaged in funds rather like a business expansion scheme. The bonds would be trade-able. There would be a secondary market in them. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
envisage a maximum limit of, say, £10 million per borrower and a total permitted maximum of, say, £1 billion. I shall come to the cost of that subsidy in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage that, with the approval of the Department of Trade and Industry, through its regional offices—I pay tribute to the efficiency and skill of those offices in monitoring the activities of small companies in their regions—and local authorities, new jobs will be created with the issue of industrial revenue bonds, and tax advantages will result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the advantage to the economy of such bonds? The tax advantage has to be targeted specifically on certain types of capital investment. In Kettering, we have an industrial estate which does not enjoy enterprise zone status, and it is very difficult for small and medium-sized companies there to attract sufficient finance not only for the infrastructure work within the industrial estate, but simply to put up the buildings and to buy the plant and equipment with which to create the new jobs. If industrial revenue bonds were solely for industrial estates—even for certain industries—that would target the benefit of this tax advantage on industrial growth in certain sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big advantage of industrial revenue bonds is that they create a long-term bond, where the principal is repaid over a significant number of years. The cash cost to the borrower—the interest cost and the portion of the principal that is redeemed each year—is probably much less than it would be if the company was borrowing from the bank through an overdraft or was borrowing over a comparatively short period. The cash burden of the borrower is minimised and spread over a longer time. If there is a hurdle rate for the discounted cash rate of return that a company needs to achieve, it is easier to achieve that with long-term, comparatively cheap borrowing. Businesses are then in a better position to expand and to create employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who pays for this? For many years, the problem in the United States has been concern at the erosion of the tax base for the issue of these revenue bonds, because substantial tax advantages have been enjoyed by individuals. I propose a cap of, say, £1 billion on the issue of these bonds. The tax forgone per annum would therefore be about £90 million. To cover that tax forgone, when the business expansion scheme comes up for review over the next two years, part of the subsidy in that scheme should be redirected to industrial revenue bonds. I am a great supporter of the BES, but the high hopes of that scheme have not entirely been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe the argument that the Government would suffer as a result of the issue of these bonds because interest costs on gilts would rise. Even the issue of £1 billion-worth of bonds over a number of years would not crowd out the Government broker's ability to issue gilts at attractive rates. After all, we have a declining PSBR, and thus a declining need for the Government broker to issue new gilts. Although those are significantly on a taxable basis, the issue of industrial bonds would not damage the Government's ability to sell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interest in the idea has been expressed by the CBI, the Association of Corporate Treasurers and a number
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
of large companies. Although, as I said at the outset, this may be the beginning of a debate stretching over not months but years, I commend the concept to the Committee and ask the Financial Secretary to consider my arguments sympathetically in the months to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's aims. He wants to ensure first that capital investment takes place and secondly that that investment is designed to make a significant contribution to employment. The Opposition naturally want to see those aims fulfilled, and in view of the decline in manufacturing investment and employment in the manufacturing sector we can understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not sure that the new clause is an effective way of achieving the hon. Gentleman's aims. It would enable a limited company to issue a loan stock the interest on which would not be chargeable to tax when it was in the investor's hands. My suspicion and scepticism are deepened by the comments of the Sunday Times on 2 June:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme would give tax relief to companies on bonds issued for investment in job-creation projects. The tax relief would provide attractive long term financing for companies and an easily tradable source of income for high rate taxpayers."</p></blockquote>
The result could be a bond the attraction of which was somewhat similar to the attraction of the business expansion scheme, by reducing the tax burden for higher-rate taxpayers without bringing about the job creation that he and the Opposition would like to see. Such a bond could be quite costly to the Exchequer, but the Financial Secretary will no doubt deal with that question. We must ask whether it is the best way of using the available resources, and whether we can ensure that the right kind of investment takes place. If my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) were here, he would no doubt say that it must take place in the right part of the country as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very sceptical about the use of resources directed towards the relief of tax for individual higher-rate taxpayers. We feel that the same level of resources could be used more effectively—although we would, of course, stray too far from the new clause if we were to discuss the possible alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the rest of the Sunday Times' comment rather intriguing. It went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme is favoured by the Government because it places very little extra burden on the Exchequer and would effect savings in unemployment benefit."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that is true, or whether the hon. Gentleman hoped for a suitable response from the Government Front Bench when he discussed his new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>Sunday Times</i> goes on to say—even more intriguingly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The administration and verification of job creation would be financed by borrowers and farmed out to accountants or lawyers."</p></blockquote>
That does not appear to be in the new clause, which seems to envisage the Inland Revenue and the Department of Trade and Industry working happily together to discern which projects are liable to lead to job creation and which are not. I found the comment intriguing because accountants and lawyers do not seem to be the right people to assess an investment project or its job creation possibilities.—[Interruption.] My hon. Friends seem to object to that. I shall sort it out with them at another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
That is the reason for our scepticism about the new clause. We accept the hon. Gentleman's account of his aim in the new clause, but there must be much better ways of using resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Moore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Lady and unlike her hon. Friends, I am neither an accountant nor a lawyer, so she and I can share a degree of scepticism about this proposal, seeing no particular job benefit in it for ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respect the care and attention that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) has put into this proposal. It is a lesson to many of us on how to launch a new idea on the Finance Bill and how to carry the argument further. I admire even more his conservatism in trying delicately to suggest to the Treasury where it might find some of the costs enshrined in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is starting a campaign that might take a long time. I have had similar experiences in the American investment banking community and I share his knowledge about this subject in the United States. I also share my hon. Friend's desire for more jobs to be created and for a reduction in unemployment—a view obviously shared by the hon. Member for Thur-rock. But we must consider whether the scheme is a satisfactory way of achieving it. That is the point that she rightly asks us to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is modelled on the tax-exempt industrial development bonds which have been issued in the United States by the states and local authorities. The federal tax exemption was originally intended for bonds issued by the states to fund public projects such as roads and schools, but increasingly the states and local authorities have used the federal tax exemption to raise funds for private sector use as well.

President Reagan's recent tax reform plan includes a proposal to withdraw the exemption, except for bonds confined to public authorities' own use. The Administration's view is that the exemption has proved to be inefficient because for every $2 of interest costs saved by the borrower, the federal Government forgoes more than $3 of tax revenue. So at least one third of the benefit remains with financial intermediaries and higher income investors. The exemption has lowered tax receipts and so caused serious erosion in the income tax base, and has had distortive effects on the economy. In the light of the United States findings and plan to withdraw the exemption, I suggest that we should be cautious about introducing a similar exemption in this country.

Although the aim of the exemption would be to generate additional investment and jobs, in practice much of the subsidy would probably go to investment which would have taken place anyway. It would not be easy to ensure that the subsidy was limited to job-creating projects which would not otherwise have gone ahead. Large companies, for example, would not find it difficult to put forward projects they were already planning which would—in the words of the clause— make a "significant contribution to employment". So the cost of the exemption could be substantial in relation to the amount of genuinely additional investment and jobs created.

My hon. Friend rightly drew our attention to the business expansion scheme. Additionality is a key feature of the Keith study and the scheme must be looked at in that regard. But to the extent that there was extra investment it would tend to consist of marginal projects which were made profitable only by the subsidy. So the return on the investment might be poor and the jobs might not last. Investment decisions might also be distorted—for example between a project which qualified for the subsidy and a high-technology project which created fewer jobs initially but might prove more worthwhile in the longer term. All this would tend to run counter to the broad direction of our policy or reducing distortions in the tax treatment of companies and their investment, in particular through the corporation tax reform we introduced last year.

I accept, of course, that investment projects need funds to finance them. But there is no evidence of any general shortage of funds for investment in worthwhile projects. Company profitability is improving strongly, releasing more internal funds for investment. Small firms have less ready access to the capital markets, but the main need is to improve the flow of equity to small firms—hence the business expansion scheme, which is a tightly-drawn and narrowly new equity investment. The past few years have seen a dramatic growth in the sources of funds for expansion, including specialist companies which can provide injections of equity and long term funds, as well as established bodies such as Investors in Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
