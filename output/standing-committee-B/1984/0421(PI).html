	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Blair (Sedgefield)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 17, line 20, leave out subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is my first speech in the Committee, may I say at the outset what a pleasure it is to appear before you, Miss Fookes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to enable us to understand the thinking behind subsection (6). The clause deals in general terms with the interest on tax recovered or recoverable by assessment. Subsection (6) deals with the situation in which a trader who is not an authorised person within the meaning of clause 14(2) issues an invoice. Under clause 14(2) the definition of persons not authorised to issue invoices includes those not registered under the principal Act. If someone not registered for VAT issues an invoice showing a certain amount of VAT due, clause 17(6) allows the Customs and Excise to charge interest on the amount shown to be due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some difficulty with that, which is why the amendment is really an inquiry. Perhaps I have misunderstood the definition of an unauthorised person. However, it seems to me that someone not authorised because, say, he is not registered under the principal Act, would not be entitled to issue an invoice requiring a VAT payment. If so, it strikes me as odd that such a person can be required to pay interest on the amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my question to the Minister. If no tax is due because the person is not authorised to ask for tax, it strikes me as somewhat peculiar that interest could be payable on it. Presumably if a VAT payment is requested by someone not authorised to request it, the person asked to pay cannot properly be liable to do so, because no authority to make the request is vested in the person issuing the invoice. If that is so, even if the unauthorised person received the VAT that he was not entitled to receive, surely he would be liable to pay the money back to the person to whom the invoice had been issued. If restitution were due in that manner, it is difficult to see how the Customs and Excise would be entitled to levy interest on the amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a reasonable explanation involving the definition of authorised people. I await the Minister's reply with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Barney Hayhoe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first welcome the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
Blair) to the discussions in Committee. I share his view that the language of clause 17 in its entirety is not of such blinding simplicity that there could be no difficulty for anyone in understanding the inter-relations between all the provisions. However, I am happy to try to explain the purpose behind subsection (6), which the amendment would exclude. As the hon. Gentleman said, that would exclude from liability to default interest those amounts shown as tax on invoices issued by unauthorised persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members might ask how an unauthorised person could issue an invoice. I am advised that from time to time people invoice customers improperly with a bill that includeds VAT when they are not registered as VAT traders. The law provides that if such a demand for VAT is made by an unauthorised trader and is collected from the customer, it must go to the Revenue, because it has been paid by someone who thinks that he has paid VAT and therefore comes within that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person behaves improperly by hanging on to the money, accumulating it and not giving it to the Revenue, having charged his customers VAT, the money must be remitted to the Revenue. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that if the money is not remitted, default interest can be charged. The sort of person who might do that is the moonlighter or someone on the fringe of the black enconomy. If an honest and law-abiding citizen has been charged VAT and, thinking that he is doing the right thing, pays it to an unauthorised person, such a person must remit it to the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person stays under the threshold in a given year, but during that year thinks it likely that he will exceed it, will he be liable to VAT on sales made prior to exceeding it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need notice to work that out precisely. My understanding is that for the period when someone believes that he is trading properly below the threshold—even when the threshold is considered for a shorter period than 12 months that sort of calculation can be made—all is well. If, at the end of the year, he finds that he ought to be registered, he must take steps quickly to register. But that goes way beyond the clause and is not affected by it as far as I know. The requirements for registration are in other legislation and are not at issue here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible that a person may decide to write a VAT invoice on the basis of believing that it is likely that within 12 months he will exceed the VAT threshold and that Customs and Excise may have refused to provide him with VAT registration on the ground that he would not do so, so he would be setting out to ensure that he fell within the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that were so, and the individual was desirous of falling within the law, he would remit the VAT to the Revenue in the proper way. The basis of the hon. Gentleman's question is that if a person sought eagerly to ensure that he was behaving totally lawfully, there would be no question of his withholding payments that he had received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
not being present to hear the beginning of his speech. I apologise to the Committee for not being present during the whole of the debate. I am involved in the Transport Bill proceedings in the House, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike), and we cannot be in two places at once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for Customs and Excise having adequate powers to ensure that if anyone wilfully evades tax due, through whatever strategem, Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue can correct that situation. There is a very fine balance to be drawn when carrying out those powers. In some cases, it might be said, correctly, that it was invading the privacy of the individual, but in my experience the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise do not usually invade privacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to certain safeguards, I am happy with the clause and I have been reassured by the Minister's comments. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has also been reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two brief points to make. I share the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). The appropriate powers are needed if tax evasion of this nature is taking place. It is not right that people should retain money which is due to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation on VAT is complex. I was talking over lunch today to some people who run small businesses. They have considerable worries about the documentation involved in paying tax, and therefore they are subject to the abuses implicit in the Minister's introduction to the debate. We cannot accept moonlighters in the black economy, and we must ensure that Customs and Excise have the powers to stamp out such practices and to see that the money that is due goes to the Exchequer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make one small comment in response to the points made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), although he is not in the Committee at the moment. No doubt he will read my reply in Hansard. He asked about registration. The trader is under a liability at the end of every quarter to judge whether he should be registered and in law a figure for the quarterly turnover is given as well as one for the annual turnover. As quarterly returns are required, no one should find, after trading for a considerable period, that he is still uncertain about whether he should be registered. The requirements are in schedule I of the VAT Act 1983.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister estimated how much is lost through abuse of the kind that he described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not the figure before me, but I shall try to obtain an estimate. By its nature, it must be a very broad estimate, because, if we had a precise figure, the investigation branch of Customs and Excise would pursue the individual traders and seek to make them comply with the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should quickly reassure my hon. Friends the Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) that, broad though the alliances which the Labour party constructs may be, we do not intend to become the party of tax dodgers. My purpose in tabling the amendment was to look at things not so much from the point of view of traders as from that of their customers and my hon. Friends may have slightly misunderstood the point that I was making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said that those sums should rightly go to the Exchequer. However, my point is that they are not sums which rightly go to the Exchquer but those which a customer has paid to a trader who had no authorisation to issue invoices with VAT on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arising out of what the Minister said, I have two questions to ask him. First, let us suppose that a trader wrongly charges VAT to a customer which the customer pays to him. If the Revenue is aware of the identity of the customer and knows that he should not have paid VAT, why is the money not rightly to go to the customer rather than to the Exchequer and why does the Exchequer have the right to money which the customer has been wrongly called upon to pay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that my second question relates rather more to the trader. As I understand subsection (6), the interest is to be paid from the date on which the invoice was issued. Presumably, that is different from the interest that is paid in normal circumstances where that is calculated by reference to the prescribed accounting periods. Normally, with an authorised trader, the interest will be assessed on the basis of the prescribed accounting periods and the various interest provisions contained in the remainder of clause 17. But subsection (6) specifies that it is the date of issue of the invoice which attracts immediate payment of interest and there is a rate of interest from the date on which the invoice is issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a customer decides not to pay the VAT on the invoice and is within his rights not to do so because the trader is an unauthorised person who has no right to claim VAT. Will the trader be left with interest to pay? It is worth while for the Committee to know the answer to that question, which arises out of the bizarre circumstance in which the Government are claiming interest on sums which should never have been paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In these detailed debates, there is always a danger of going much wider and opening up areas which are covered by other parts of the legislation. If an unauthorised trader invoices a customer for VAT and it is paid, the requirement that the unregistered trader should pass that VAT money to the Revenue is in other legislation. As I understand it, that requirement is not affected by what we seek, which is to ensure that the unauthorised trader who has improperly collected VAT by definition, if he is unauthorised, the collection must have been improper—is not treated differently if he does not pass that tax on to the Revenue than the registered trader. Of course, if he is an unauthorised trader he will incur a penalty under clause 14 which we have already covered. This clause ensures that he pays interest on money which he has improperly retained for his own use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
Therefore, rather than going into the wider question, I rest my case by saying that it is necessary for us to make such provision because otherwise we should be giving an advantage to the unauthorised trader and I am sure that no one in the Committee wants that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I do not want to press the amendment to a Division, but I should like this point to be clarified. Is it true that the interest is payable from the date not when the unauthorsied money is collected but when the invoice is issued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In normal circumstances the interest will be payable from the time when the accounting period comes to an end, when everything is proceeding according to the law. But when there is an improper procedure, the only date that could be administratively appointed is that of the invoice; otherwise, there could be even greater difficulties. But is should be borne in mind that the unauthorised trader would be behaving improperly, anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 17, line 32, after "is", insert "either".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 123, in page 17, line 36, after "concerned", insert "or if later the date on which the warrant or cheque for that amount reached that person".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two small amendments are designed to correct a point in the Bill which might be important to some registered traders. Clause 17 imposes an interest charge at the time of repayment of excessive VAT. According to subsection (7), that interest runs from the seventh day after the commissioners have ordered the repayment to be made. In ordinary circumstances, that would be a very reasonable proposal, but it could operate to the disadvantage of the taxpayer through no fault of his own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, it is not unknown for a strike to occur in the Customs and Excise, and that sometimes happens in the postal services. Consequently, if the commissioners order a cheque to be made out but the taxpayer does not receive it until much later, he may find himself substantially out of pocket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 123 proposes that the reckonable date should be that on which the cheque reaches the taxpayer. I realise that there could be objections to that, as it could be difficult to prove when he received the cheque. But if my amendment does not appeal to the Minister of State, he might wish to consider other ways of securing such an improvement—for example, by saying that the interest should run from the date when the cheque was presented or paid into the recipient's account. That would cover the possible difficulty and would not be to the disadvantage of the Customs and Excise to any great extent. It might remedy a grave injustice to a trader in the circumstances that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has explained the reasoning behind his amendments very clearly. They would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
make the reckonable date for interest charge calculations the date when the payment arrived from the Customs and Excise, if it was later than the notional date described in subsection (7). At present, Customs & Excise makes repayments twice a week. For those traders paid by credit transfer, payment is effected after six days; for those paid by payable order, the orders are posted, using first-class mail, after two days unless a weekend intervenes, in which case it is four days. Therefore the notional seven days allowed is, if anything, marginally in the trader's favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only in exceptional circumstances will payments be received later. My hon. Friend acknowledged that, but spoke about the possibility of a strike delaying such repayment. In those circumstances, the Customs would deal with the problem under exceptional arrangements. Usually payment would be made within the notional time. That notional time is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving his amendment my hon. Friend undermined to some extent by saying that he recognised the difficulties in determining the date when payment was made if it were later than the notional date which the clause sought to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that this consequence is not in my hon. Friend's mind, but the amendment would make it possible for an unscrupulous trader to allege that the money turned up at a much later date. As six years can elapse between the time of payment and the time of aciton under this clause, I can foresee the difficulties that would arise and the enormous amounts of time and energy involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I believe—I hope that the Committee agrees—that the notional date suggested in the clause is pretty reasonable. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister said about the amendment and I referred to the great evidential difficulties it involved. My hon. Friend did not mention any possible alternative means of avoiding the difficulty that I outlined, especially on the presentation of a cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not quite good enough to say, "In circumstances as yet unforeseen the Customs and Excise could be depended upon to act as gentlemen and do the right thing." A worrying feature about much of the new code for which we are legislating in relation to the Keith committee's proposals is that this arm of the executive has a wide discretion, which I am sure will be used in the vast majority of cases as my hon. Friend assures us it will. However we are continuing an undesirable trend by granting enormous discretions which the taxpayer cannot ultimately rely upon as a legal remedy to ensure a reasonable outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take my remarks on board and that he can give some reassurance if not today, then later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly respond to that request. If my hon. Friend can come up with a new formulation on Report, we shall examine it. I shall ask my officials to go over the ground again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system contains important longstops, which we must always remember. The Customs and Excise are civil servants. If they are engaged in delaying procedures, that is maladministration. The Parliamentary Commissioner can have such cases reported to him and he has investigated such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
It is wrong to suggest that traders are left totally defenceless against arbitrary acts by the Customs in this area or in others. There will be greater opportunities for appeal under the reasonable excuse provision than originally envisaged. There is also a backup power in that people can contact their Members of Parliament to go to the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave that point with my hon. Friend. If he comes up with new wording, we shall of course look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the purpose of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). However, when providing compensation for a trader who, for whatever reasons, has made excessive payments, we must ensure that there is equity in the arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a notional date of a seven-day block period, with which the national payments system and the national postal system can usually cope. Most payments are made by cheque, and cheques can be cleared within three days, except where a bank holiday intervenes or during peak times, in which case there may be a two-day delay. Provided that Customs and Excise carry out the commissioners' instructions in the most expeditious way possible, I should have thought that the provision would work. On the other hand, I do not understand the administrative procedures used by Customs and Excise in doing the paperwork sufficiently to know whether they can cause delay, so I find it difficult to balance the concept of a fixed period in which everything must be calculated with that of a moveable feast taking into account the unpredictability of the payments system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to support the seven-day block period because I cannot see the relevance of the amendment. I cannot see, for the life of me—I may have this wrong—how a substantial number of traders would lose out in terms of interest payments as a result of excess tax payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can develop the point that my hon. Friend has just made and ascertain from the Minister whether I have understood the position correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial importance of the reckonable date is that interest is payable from that date under subsection (4). Am I right in thinking that in circumstances where there has been an incorrect repayment of tax or payment in respect of excess credit, the reckonable day falls seven days after the issue of the written instruction? Suppose that the written instruction does not arrive. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) said that that could happen as a result of a strike in Customs and Excise. But it could also happen because of the vagaries of the post.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I would not deny that possibility. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) that the seven days allowed in the Bill will usually be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should get the matter into its proper perspective. The amendment seeks to prevent the possibility of unfairness arising in exceptional circumstances. But I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
cannot see how one could devise a system to meet that aim without opening the door to the unscrupulous trader to use the provision for his own benefit and against taxpayers' interests. As often happens, we have to make a judgment. I believe that the judgment in the clause is right, although, as I told my hon. Friend, I should be prepared to consider other suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) is such a slavish supporter of the Government that he cannot support me on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to be tarred with that kind of brush. I thought that I had made it clear that I was equivocal about the matter. I thought that I had put both sides of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be a slavish supporter of the alliance if he sees both sides and comes down between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had made it clear that the amendment was designed to meet wholly exceptional circumstances—for example, the possibility of a strike in the Customs and Excise or the Post Office preventing the receipt of the cheque by the intended recipient. If that happened, it would not be possible for the clearing system to operate. So although I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said, that is not the circumstance that the amendment is designed to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not push the amendment further. The debate has gone on somewhat longer than I had expected, and, in view of the exceptionally reasonable attitude that the Minister has taken, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 18, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(aa) may prescribe a floating rate;".</p></q>
This amendment relates to subsection (8) and the prescribed rate of interest to be paid in the circumstances that the Committee has just debated. The subsection provides for different rates for different purposes. The Law Society suggested that it might be useful for the subsection to prescribe a floating rate of interest. Experience of interest on income tax payments is that one has to wait for an order from the Treasury following a change in interest rates, and that may or may not be to the advantage of the taxpayer, depending on which way rates are moving. Why not simply say, "We shall have LIBOR plus X per cent or the average of the four clearing banks' base rates plus Y per cent"? A simple system of that nature was what the Law Society had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to a sound point, because in recent years the volatile nature of exchange rates has led to criticism that the procedures for changing the rate of interest are not sufficiently responsive to those changes. As a result, the Government asked the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise jointly to review the matter. My hon. Friend recognised the link between the two and the need to work in step. The possibility of moving to a system of more automatic changes is very much within the ambit of that review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of the review, as I hope my hon. Friend will agree. I can

assure him that, once the working party has reported, the Government will take its findings into account in the proposed legislation next year to implement the Keith committee report, in so far as it relates to the Inland Revenue. That would be the appropriate time to make any changes affecting the Customs and Excise part of the legislation, and of course, the relevant provisions of the legislation where interest was being determined would not be operative before next year's Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment, in the knowledge that the point is being studied and that it will be dealt with—I hope in a reasonable fashion—in the Finance Bill next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have become very inhibited about speaking to amendments tabled by Tory Members in case it should be held against me. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) intends to withdraw the amendment, but in my view interest rates should be up to date. Repayments of this nature are done by computer these days, and there is no reason why the computer programmes should not contain today's rate of interest at noon—or whenever it is that the rate changes. We should ensure that when any repayment is made, account is taken of the amount made by the Exchequer. I assume that, like any other institution, it invests its money on the overnight markets and gains through floats and various other arrangements. Why should the Exchequer keep that interest? Why should not the trader have his fair share? That would seem wholly sensible and people would get their just desserts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement. I accept what he says in the light of the review that is to take place, although we shall obviously return to the matter next year. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I wish to ask about the operative date. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) said that these matters would be computerised. I assume that Customs and Excise will need some time to sort out its programme. The Minister said during the previous debate that these provisions would not have come into force by this time next year. Perhaps he could tell us when they will come into force. Subsection (1) says only that
	<br><q><p>"This subsection shall come into operation on such day as the Treasury may …appoint."</p></q>
My second point relates to not only this but several clauses on the Keith committee proposals. However, it is most relevant to clause 17. It is very difficult even for experts to understand and interpret accurately the convoluted language of the clauses, particularly clause 17(1), (2) and (3). Mr. St. John Price writes every week in Accountancy Age on the subject of VAT. The Committee will probably accept that one must be a bit of an expert to write on VAT every week. I write in Accountancy Age every week, but not on VAT. He said:
	<br><q><p>"Parliament is about to be asked to perpetrate a serious injustice upon businesses. The VAT clauses of the Finance Bill are so clumsily
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
drafted that it requires hours of study to understand them. I believe that this means that only a handful of people do so fully and I question whether anyone has been able to think through the practical consequences."</p></q>
He has sent me a redraft of clauses 12, 13 and 17. I should like to send these simple English versions to my hon. Friend to see whether he can incorporate some of them, at least on Report, to simplify the legislation and make it more intelligible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks about the date of implementation. It will require a proper computer programme to deal with the matters contained in clause 17. The provisions of clauses 13 and 17 are very unlikely to come into operation before mid-1988 because of the extensive reprogramming of computer runs that will be necessary. We are well ahead on that, so I can confidently say that there will be time to sort out the interest problem before that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the language of the clause, I echo my hon. Friend's sentiments. The Renton committee examined the language of legislation. Lord Renton and his colleagues slaved and toiled and produced a very helpful report. But, as far as I can judge, the language is still as unreadable and unintelligible to the ordinary layman as it was. Occasionally I read the statutes of last century; I can understand them. I suspect that in those days Parliament was not the legislative sausage machine that it is today. The amount of primary legislation going through Parliament was very small, and it was probably examined with much greater care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hon. Friend's point about the need for simple language to describe tax provisions. I hope that he will joint me in commending that Customs and Excise for the considerable progress that has been made, and for the outside help it has accepted to make its leaflets more understandable. I believe that the department has on occasion won awards for the clarity of its English. It is important that official documents are expressed in language intelligible to the ordinary person, even if our legislative and legal requirements impose language like this upon us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with what has been said about the complexity of the language in these clauses. I should hate to do anything to put my fellow trade unionists in the legal profession out of work, or lessen the burden of litigation that will inevitably flow from the provisions. However, many of those who will have to implement and understand the legislation are small traders and small business men, and the Bill visits an extremely difficult task upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 is particularly complicated, but no worse than some of its predecessors, or, indeed, clauses 18, 19 and 20, and the fact that they will be so difficult for small traders to understand must cause us all great anxiety. I am pleased to hear that the Customs and Excise is attempting to simplify its pamphlets and I have been told that the attempt has been quite effective, but Parliament must be careful when introducing legislation of this type. Many of the Keith committee recommendations are fairly draconian, and I shall return to them on clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The elision of the civil and criminal law on civil fraud, and the introduction of automatic surcharges in clause 18 in particular, make it dramatically important that ordinary people should understand the provisions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 19, line 26, leave out subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 42 seeks to delete clause 18(5). It is a somewhat clumsy amendment, as consequential amendments would have to follow it to make sense of it. Many of my arguments are perhaps more amenable to debate on clause stand part rather than on the limited subject of subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues arise on clause 18. First, whether default surcharge is right—and we shall debate that on clause stand part. Secondly, even if we accept the principle of automatic surcharges in clause 18, is the type of surcharge introduced in the clause in itself too harsh? Clearly, subsection (5) must be read in conjunction with subsection (4). The effect is that there is either a fixed penalty of £30 or a specified percentage of the outstanding tax for any period. The trader will have to pay whichever is the greater of those two amounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some experience of drafting and I tried to simplify clause 18(2)(b). At first I thought that it seemed an incredibly complicated way of saying one year, but "within one year" does not quite express what is meant. It is a slight variation on Keith but, as I understand it, a default in any two accounting periods where a year overlaps with the next, or within one year, means that surcharge provisions will come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The surcharge provisions will be the specified percentage or the £30. There is then, under subsection (5), a series of staggered increases in the percentage, starting with 5 per cent if there is one prescribed accounting period in which the surcharge applies. Am I correct in thinking that a trader must have two defaults within that period of one year, or the overlap of a year, before the surcharge comes into operation? For any one accounting period when the surcharge comes into operation the liability is 5 per cent for one default rising to 10 per cent and then 30 per cent. Therefore, for the first surcharge accounting period the amount payable will be 5 per cent or £30; 10 per cent or £30 for the second; and up to a maximum of 30 per cent for subsequent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A percentage of the oustanding tax in any accounting period may be a large sum of money. If a person could be in default on many occasions, it is difficult to understand why there is no overlap with earlier provisions dealing with serious misdeclarations or evasion of tax. What provisions already exist to deal with circumstances where there may be an overlap between the automatic surcharge and earlier clauses that impose other penalities? Clause 18 will impose automatically
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
strict penalties in circumstnces where earlier provisions that allow for greater flexibility could be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the analysis of the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) in pointing out the draconian nature of the penalties provided for in clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no quarrel with the concept of automatic surcharges in this instance because the arrears of VAT are a long-standing and expensive abuse for which no one can provide a rational justification, but the remedy proposed in some aspects is out of proportion to the disease that it seeks to cure. Once on the treadmill of the escalating scale, as the hon. Member for Sedgefield lucidly pointed out, it is likely to be difficult for a small business to get off. A full twelve months' perfect punctuality is required to avoid the penalty going up by 5 per cent next time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept that we want to dissuade people from being lax in submitting accurate returns, but the penalty, which rises to 30 per cent, seems to be out of all proportion to the problems created by the existing lacuna in the law. If a trader, whose outputs are standard rated and whose biggest input is labour, has to bear ultimately a tax of 30 per cent of the VAT due even for one quarterly period, it could be utterly devastating to his cash flow. It would far outweight any conceivable gains from the use of the money for longer than was allowed. It could be so large, in relation to the quarterly cash flow, that a default in the next quarter could be inevitable, with the only escape being to cease trading. I am sure that my hon. Friend does not intend or desire that consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment proposes to reduce the maximum penalty exigible in these circumstances to 15 per cent. That would still be a heavy tax for any business to bear. It would go far beyond mere commercial restitution to the Customs and Excise for the loss which it would suffer by not having the tax revenue at the due time. At present interest rates, it would only be a fair restitution if the tax remained unpaid for more than a year and only then, if it were deductible in calculating the taxable profits of the business, which it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, the Inland Revenue's official interest rate on overdue tax is only 12 per cent. If we were to reduce the rate exigible by Customs and Excuse, 15 per cent does not seem out of the line with other penalties available in other parts of the tax code. I commend the amendment to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and I am sure that the Conservative association will be most concerned to hear of his support for Socialist amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield because the default to which we are referring could arise through evasion of tax and for other similar reasons. However, there could also be default for genuine reasons. That means that where there is a default, arrears will have to be paid and the automatic

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
surcharge, which could be as high as 30 per cent is far too high, especially for small businesses. The Labour party is the party of the small business, and in introducing the amendment we are showing the way in which the big heel of Conservatism will tread on those little companies which for all sorts of reasons, will be unable to get their complex VAT paperwork straight. The automatic system of imposing possibly a 30 per cent surcharge is far too strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gets too carried away by his own rhetoric, he should take notice of subsection (6), which makes clear that if the taxpayer "exercised all due diligence" he would not be covered by the provisions.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter will be decided by the commissioner when such circumstances arise. We cannot predict what that decision will be and I am sure that if we sit here, not for too long, we will come up with a list of default actions—that is, non-payment of all the moneys—which I would not regard as tax evasion or other such default. We seek to provide—I support my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield in this—Customs and Excise with discretion rather than a harsh automatic approach to the issue. I believe that it is advisable to provide Customs and Excise with more flexibility rather than the harsh arrangements which seems to be implicit in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give some support to my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair). In my experience the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise do not go round and try to beat the small trader with a hammer. If they see the slightest inaccuracy in a set of accounts as a result of any default, they do not try to get everything they can out of that small trader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). Subsection (6) states that provided that a person has
	<br><q><p>"exercised all due diligence to secure that, within the appropriate time limit, the Commissioners did receive the return ... he shall not be liable to the surcharge and the default shall be left out of account for the purposes of subsection (5)".</p></q>
There is a problem there in that the person affected has to provide that he did everything in his power and exercised diligence in trying to act properly. Apart from my worry about that, I am completely satisfied with the clause. Perhaps the Minister could reassure us that, through regulations or in some other way, the onus of proof will not be taken too literally. The Bill provides that unless the person affected can supply proof, a default surcharge will be thrust upon him. Common sense should be applied, so that people who inadvertently do not follow the procedures are not penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there is an onus on small traders and people who pay VAT to conduct their affairs in such a way that they are accountable and in order and that the books are properly kept. I also recognise that generally speaking, many people do not do that because they have some reason for wishing to evade the taxes for which they are liable. I insist that the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise should have the power to recover VAT and bring such people to book. Nevertheless, there are cases in which through some small error or inadvertence, something has gone wrong or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
has got lost in the post. Everyone knows of such cases. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that in those circumstances the Inland Revenue will have the power to recognise that and to refrain from exercising the punitive powers given to it by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by outlining the background to the clause against which the amendments should be seen. It is estimated that £1.2 billion of VAT is outstanding at any one time. That places a burden on the economy. Money has to be borrowed and the charge paid for out of public expenditure, which would not be necessary if the tax was paid on time. It also gives traders who hold onto VAT money unreasonably and improperly an advantage over traders who pay the tax on time honestly, and who, if they need to borrow money to run their businesses, borrow commercially, from the bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should the honest trader be disadvantaged by the less than honest trader who hangs on to money which he has collected on behalf of the Exchequer? Sometimes the tax is at the point of invoice and there may be other difficulties, but generally speaking the vast majority of the outstanding tax has been collected, belongs to the Exchequer and is being held by some traders unreasonably and improperly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith Committee suggested that withholding VAT and not providing the right returns, which are currently criminal offences should be decriminalised and that the criminal penalty should be replaced by a system of civil penalties, about which there would be certainty. That is what is at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) is a probing amendment, he readily acknowledged. I think that he will understand that I have to resist the amendment because, if it was taken literally, its cost over three or four years would be £600 million, as it would remove the basis upon which the surcharge is calculated and therefore the surcharge system could not operate. In those circumstances, my right honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget estimate that over a period the net effect of the measures would be to reduce the outstanding debt of £1.2 billion by about half could not be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that we are implementing the Keith committee recommendation by recommending the automatic series of penalties in the clause. Moreover, we have made some important changes. The proposals for calculating the surcharge that are embodied in subsection (5) reflect the Keith Committee's intention that the penalty for traders who persistently delay tax payments should increase in severity. I shall show how the behaviour must be so persistent as to incur the penalty. It is fundamental that the persistence of the default is linked to the automaticity—a ghastly word—of the penalties that will flow from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change from the Keith committee proposals benefits the trader. The conditions for liability to surcharge have been lessened from two defaults in two years—over eight accounting periods, as recommended by the Keith committee—to two defaults in one year, with the added provision that the liability to surcharge, or putting oneself at risk to surcharge, is wiped out by a year's non-defaulting behaviour. By behaving properly for a year, the trader wipes out the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
The only way in which a default surcharge can be incurred is by a trader defaulting twice within a period of 12 months—either by not paying the tax or by not providing the return. He would then be served with a statutory surcharge liability notice—an SLN—and he would know that he was at risk. The next time he defaults, provided the default occurs within 12 months, the surcharge of 5 per cent will bite and that amount extra must be paid. Further defaults within a year will cause the higher surcharge to become payable. However, if the tax has been correctly paid for a year, the trader is back to square one. Again, a default must occur; it must be followed by another default within 12 months; the notice must be issued, and that must be followed by another default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime is not so draconian as is being suggested, except to a trader who persistently and consistently defaults. Formerly, such a trader might well have been taken to court and if found guilty would have been made a criminal for that behaviour. Now, such a trader must have eight defaults in a row, without a clear year between any of them, before incurring the 30 per cent surcharge. Surely, that is not unreasonable. The intention of the provision is that it will have a deterrent effect on the non-complying trader who, knowing that the surcharge will be incurred—there is no mystery about it—will amend his behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) was right to intervene when it was asked what would happen if a trader had made a mistake. My hon. Friend was right to say that if a genuine mistake had been made, the trader had a reasonable excuse. As a result of the representations that have been made, we have covered that aspect in the legislation. It is an important issue. Everyone in the Committee would be worried about someone being caught up in the process of increasing surcharge if there were a reasonable excuse for his behaviour and he had behaved with "due diligence". Such a person can in the first place approach the Customs and Excise to explain what has happened. If the Customs and Excise does not accept that there is a reasonable excuse he can argue his case before the VAT tribunal. That is a protection for the honest trader who has reasonable cause for having defaulted on the due payment of his tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will feel it right to accept the clause as it stands. The suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) that we reduce the maximum penalty from 30 to 15 per cent comes rather late. The figure of 30 per cent was exposed originally by Keith in the documents that were circulated. It appeared in the document that we published last year and invited comments upon. It was generally, although not unanimously, accepted that such persistence of default should attract that level of penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard nothing today to undermine the great body of argument supporting the proposal in the clause—that we should stand by the 30 per cent but accept the more stringent conditions for its application, which are to the benefit of traders. We have made certain changes to the original Keith proposals and included the defence of "due diligence" and "reasonable excuse". In view of that, the proper course for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
Committee is to approve the clause and reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I shall return to some of what the Minister has said on clause stand part. However, I shall respond now to two specific comments that he made. First, it is important to set the outstanding £1.2 billion in context. There is no guarantee that the provisions under consideration will bring in £1.2 billion in extra revenue. Indeed, the net revenue effect is officially estimated at about £50 million a year. We always have to balance offences and their effects upon revenue with the nature of the penalties levied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) rightly said that if someone could show a "reasonable excuse" and "due diligence" he would be excused the penalty. However, we must bear in mind that the onus is on the trader to prove that. The clause imposes a framework of automatic surcharge. It is then for the trader to prove his innocence. I shall return to both subjects in greater detail on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is specifically directed to the question of the comprehensibility of the legislation. I have puzzled over the passage several times without finding out for sure exactly what it means. Subsection (7) has to be taken in conjunction with subsection (6), which allows someone who wishes to be exempted from the automatic surcharge to say that he has a reasonable excuse for not having submitted returns on time. The only excuse allowed is one that is "material to the surcharge".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of what the phrase "material to the surcharge" means is dealt with in subsection (7). Subsection (7)(a) deals with defaults that are material to the surcharge in that they give rise to it. That is comprehensible. However, I have great difficulty understanding paragraph (b). I should like the Minister to clarify it for all of us, bearing in mind that several people have said that this should at least be understandable, even if only with some difficulty. Am I correct in thinking that default is material to a surcharge not only if it is the default that actually triggers it but if it is a default that corresponds to the earlier prescribing periods which give rise to the surcharge? If I am correct, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman's final remarks were correct. The effect of the amendment would be to harm the trader, because it would prevent him appealing either to Customs and Excise or to a VAT tribunal on the ground of due diligence and reasonable excuse in respect of a default underlying a surcharge liability notice, and hence prevent an appeal against the issue of the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions will give him the right to claim reasonable excuse for one of the two earlier defaults which trigger off the issuing of the notice, as well as an appeal against the default which triggers off the imposing of the penalty. Is it not right that the trader who is faced with the penalty should be allowed to say, "No. I had a perfectly reasonable excuse for the default that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
you are taking into account as the trigger." If that is accepted by Customs and Excise or the tribunal, after a year, the slate is wiped clean and therefore no surcharge falls. The hon. Gentleman's understanding is correct: the amendment would restrict the ground for appeal in an unreasonable way. I hope that he will now feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to do that. Before doing so—this may be an entirely vain hope—may I ask the Minister a question? If he means that a default is material to a surcharge if it is one of the defaults taken into account in the earlier prescribed accounting period under subsection (2), why cannot subsection (7) state that the default is one referred to in subsection (2)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arcane mysteries of the parliamentary draftsman put it way beyond my ability to explain in an off-the-cuff intervention. I will gladly take advice and write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment takes us along a road that we trod last Thursday evening on clause 13 about which I had a similar worry which, happily, the Minister of State was able to allay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with subsection (10) is that it does not make clear whether defaults prior to the commencement date can be taken into account by the commissioners. My amendment seeks to make it clear that prior defaults are excluded from consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, when the commissioners come to give an appointed day when this part of the Bill becomes effective, the maximum possible notice of that appointed day should be given and it should be publicised by every available means. It may not be sufficient merely to send a notice to each trader, because, as my hon. Friend knows, it is in the nature of many registered traders that they do not read what are sometimes rather technical notices, preferring to pass them on to their accountant. Publicity in the press is essential to bring to the attention of the least diligent registered traders that these new obligations are to come into effect. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to assure the Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond that, I say only that I hope that my hon. Friend can give on clause 18 the assurance that he gave the Committee on clause 13 that

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth making some points about clause 18. The Minister said, when talking about an earlier amendment, that the proposals on default surcharge in clause 18 had been introduced in a milder way than was proposed by the Keith committee. In fact, the Keith committee proposed that clause 18 should not be introduced in the short term and that it should become legislation only if the other proposals in this part of the Bill did not work. Although it may be true that the Government have introduced the Keith committee's proposals in a milder form, a stricter application of the report would have meant that the proposals would not have been introduced in any form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not worried merely about the draconian nature of clause 18—I shall say something about that in a moment. We should be extremely careful about introducing legislation which is very tough on tax evasion in circumstances in which the toughness of the penalty introduced is a substitute for proper resources being allocated to the Inland Revenue to do the ordinary job of enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all against tax evasion, but it would be possible to introduce legislation—I take the argument ad absurdum—to treble all the penalties on the automatic surcharge if it were thought that the malice or evil which we were striking out was bad enough. But there must be a balance between the penalty introduced and the offence being hit at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee report recommended that the default surcharge should not come into effect immediately because the earlier clauses introduced two novel ideas. First, the clause introducing civil penalties for fraud, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) pointed out last week, contains some strange legal conceptions about what constitutes a civil fraud. The clause is a hard one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is an entirely new clause about serious misdeclarations of tax liability. The Keith committee felt that, given that the new clauses would be introduced, the best course was to see whether the new clauses, together with the use of existing enforcement powers by Customs and Excise, would be sufficient, so that the default surcharge need not be introduced. Therefore, the Keith committee entered a caveat on the default surcharge being introduced stating that it should be a medium-to-long-term measure and not one which should be introduced straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the Government are cutting back on the Civil Service and introducing draconian penalties in lieu of proper enforcement powers. That is not the way to make legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the Keith committee also said that there were administrative problems in introducing the default surcharge, and I should like the Minister to deal with that. However, that did not alter its basic point that this remedy should be brought in only after a period of trial of the remedies introduced in the earlier part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see a fair amount of difficulty in automatic surcharges as a concept. I do not say that they should not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
be used, and the Keith committee outlined how they might best be used, but there are dangers. We are not talking about circumstances in which people are deliberately evading tax—that matter was dealt with earlier. Nor are we talking about circumstances in which people have incorrectly written down the amount of tax they should have declared. We are talking about circumstances in which people simply fail or neglect to write down the proper amount of their VAT. In those circumstances, the automatic surcharge does not come into effect straight aways because, first, there must be two defaults within the period prescribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which people can avoid the consequences of pretty stern penalties is by saying at a later date that they had a "reasonable excuse" or had exercised "due diligence" to get their tax in on time. I believe that that will provoke an enormous amount of administrative work for Customs and Excise and I wonder whether thought has been given to how great the additional burden may be. If any small trader gets into problems and a default results, it will not be until the second default occurs that he will be liable for the automatic surcharge. Then, of course, he will try to argue that he had a "reasonable excuse" or had exercised "due diligence". I wonder whether Customs and Excise has given proper thought to the litigious anthill that will be uncovered when the clause is introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of an automatic surcharge is that something will fall without anything more being done, so we should consider carefully what the real balance of merit will be in introducing it. There is merit in taking the Keith committee's advice for seeing how the other penalties worked, what the position was a few years after they had been brought in, and then to decide whether to introduce clause 18. To introduce it now will make it appear that the Government are substituting the harshness of a penalty for the suitability of administrative convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a major problem in that £1,200 million of VAT is in arrears and I believe that the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) has underestimated the position. Earlier, he talked about the revenue benefit of the proposals being £50 million. That is not the Revenue benefit of the proposals at all, but its benefit this year from tightening up existing arrangements. The total benefit of the proposals to the Revenue will be £600 million overall, half of the total outstanding. If the present system of enforcement is unsatisfactory, what will be the most cost-effective way of combating it? The hon. Gentleman has put the cart before the horse because he is asking how many extra staff will be needed to police existing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we need to ask what would be a satisfactory, comprehensive system of enforcement and how many staff would be needed to police it. That must be the right way round, especially when we remember how many traders are registered for VAT. There are large numbers of them and I am glad to say that under present Government policy they are increasing all the time as the number of businesses increases. Therefore, that is the right approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only valid point made by the hon. Gentleman was that the Keith committee said that this should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
a last resort. We should ask my hon. Friend when he expects the clause to be implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister of State confirm that the Keith committee report advocated action on this aspect of VAT enforcement as part of an overall balanced package, with similar parallel enforcement for direct taxation? Will he explain why the parts of the report relating to VAT are being introduced in advance of those involving direct taxation? We understand that there is a review within the Treasury on the enforcement of direct taxation. Will the Minister tell us when it is likely to be completed and assure us that similar steps will be taken in the next Finance Bill to introduce stricter enforcement of direct taxation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in the light of what was said by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), will the Minister give the Committee the equivalent figures for arrears of direct taxation, and for the benefit that would accrue to the Revenue from tighter parallel enforcement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government intend to deal with the direct taxation aspects of the Keith report in next year's Finance Bill. We hope to publish draft clauses for consultation later this year and to have discussions with interested parties, along rather the same lines as with these VAT clauses. However, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury intends to give a little more time for consultation if possible. For this Bill, we published the relevant clauses in November, but we hope to do so earlier this year—in the late summer or autumn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Eggar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Enfield, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend the Minister of State explicitly ruling out any chance of a technical Finance Bill next year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enough to worry about with this Bill. I shall stick on that, and leave my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) to pursue his interests in his usual capable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central an estimate of the outstanding direct tax, as I did for VAT. Again, I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said. The £50 million is not the total sum at risk or the amount that we hope to collect. We believe that over a period of years the effect will be to increase compliance, so that there will be an outstanding VAT debt of roughly half the present size; indeed, we should like to reduce that even further. There will be a once-and-for-all flow of money into the Revenue, but a consequent reduction of borrowing stemming from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the Keith report recommends the surcharge regime as a longer-term solution. No doubt the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) appreciates that paragraph 24.5.9 mentions the administrative difficulties, and refers to the computer resources that would be required. The Customs and Excise believes that those will be in place, so that the regime can be implemented, by autumn of next year. That would mean that the first surcharge to be imposed could fall at the end of February 1987. That is the first date at which a notice could go out to a defaulting trader to tell him that he was incurring a 5 per cent surcharge. That explanation gives some idea of the time
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
scale. A much longer period would be required before a persistent defaulting trader reached the 30 per cent level. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is the best estimate we can give at present of the time when the computer resources and programming will be ready.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the short-term measures in the Keith report have already been taken. The report was published two years ago and early action was taken on some of its administrative measures. They had some but not sufficient effect and in our judgment it is right in the broad interest of taxpayers to go forward with the proposals for the surcharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comment was made about the various ways in which people could avoid the surcharge—for example, if they had "reasonable excuse". The simple way to avoid the surcharge is to pay on time, which many traders do. If other people followed what is best and good practice, no question of surcharging would arise. The message that should go out from the Committee is that we believe that people should comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime is not unreasonable. Because of accounting methods, traders have the VAT which they have collected to help their cash flow problems for an average of around two months, which is a not inconsiderable help to many businesses. We acknowledge that the use of that money for that period balances the extra charges that businesses incur in carrying out the requirements of the VAT regime. Successive Governments have realised that this taxation system places a burden on traders. It cannot otherwise exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of small towns in my constituency, and many small traders rely on few professional advisers to help them keep up to date with day-to-day administration. Will the Minister say whether dilatoriness of professional advisers would constitute a reasonable excuse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is highly unlikely. Otherwise, dilatory professional advisers would be in high demand. If all one had to do to have a "reasonable excuse" was to find an accountant who would delay everything, there would be easy pickings to be made. I am not sure whether that is Liberal policy. Perhaps, on reflection, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will find that it is not supported by some of his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sedgefield very properly raised staff resources and the problems that would arise with a large number of appeals. That was one of the matters we had to balance. For the tax administrators, the easiest course would be no right of appeal, which would be the ideal arrangement for the tax gatherers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, tax officials do not look at the matter purely from their own point of view. As we would expect from such a devoted group of public servants as those in the revenue departments, they see things in the round and they have taken account of representations. We thought it right to incur the extra work involved in allowing the range of appeals on the grounds of "due diligence" and "reasonable excuse". I should think that the House would be prepared to place that extra charge on the resources of the Customs and Excise and would accept the extra administration involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
I hope that there will not be a great deal of litigation, and that is why I resisted the idea of allowing appeals to the tribunals on grounds of the amount of the penalties. I said earlier in our proceedings that I would rather exclude the possibility of the power of litigation in clause 23 being applied by the Customs and Excise in an administrative capacity than lose the automatic nature of the penalty. But we shall come to that at a later stage. I have been reinforced in my view that we should not seek to extend the area of litigation to the amount of the penalties and surcharges involved. The Opposition Front Bench argued with great force that if the power was to be exercised in an administrative sense by the Customs and Excise there was a case for its being exercised by the VAT tribunals. My response to that was that I should prefer it to be exercised by neither—that in that case it would be better to go back to Keith and stick to the automatic nature of the penalties with a right of appeal against their imposition. It is with those considerations in mind that I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). Clearly, the Minister is right that dilatory advisers could not constitute a "reasonable excuse". As I understand it, the normal rule is that if a person fails to meet a legal obligation because of his advisers his recourse is to sue those advisers. I shall send the hon. Gentleman a bill for that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right that the tax should always be paid; we would not wish to suggest anything that militated against that. People are under an obligation to pay the tax and it is essential that they should do so. As the Minister says, one discriminates against those who do pay the tax if one is easy on those who do not. However, we must strike a balance recognising the realities within which people have to work and the type of penalties that can be levied upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), let me say that my complaint about the Government is not that they have failed to decide the staffing before deciding the policy. It is that they should decide on a fair and right policy for VAT enforcement and then decide how many staff it takes to administer it. My worry is that they have cut back on the number of staff—they have decided how many staff they can afford—before deciding the policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 introduces into the VAT code a repayment supplement payable on certain delayed repayments of VAT. That is wholy laudable. However, one or two questions arise if one compares the clause with the other clauses in this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister advise me why his Department has chosen to treat the repayment supplement differently from the interest on tax recovered or recoverable by assessment and in relation to the default surcharge?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1)(c) contains a de minimis provision, saying that no supplement will be payable where there is a minimum interval of 30 days following overpayment by the taxpayers. There is an error here, as there was in clause 17(7)(a), in that payment is required in such a way that a written instruction may be given by the commissioners, leading to the same result that I mentioned in the case of customs strikes, postal strikes, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the order may be given to pay the supplement, the money may not be paid according to the instructions. During the intervening period, the Customs and Excise will have the use of the money, and I do not see why it should have that benefit. The benefit should go to the taxpayer; he should get the interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society also objects to the drafting of the clause. It says:
	<br><q><p>"The repayment supplement is necessary for the same reason as the default surcharge, viz, to prevent one party being prejudiced by the unjustified delay of the other. It is clearly inequitable that delays by the department should be penalised less severely than delays by taxpayers, and the inequality of treatment is likely to become a source of resentment, which is not to the advantage of the department."</p></q>
That refers to clause 17, whereby the taxpayer has to pay interest on tax recovered or recoverable by assessment, following the seventh day after the day on which the written instruction was issued by the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder why the Customs and Excise has a de minimis provision of 30 days in its favour, while the taxpayer has a de minimis provision of only seven days in his favour. If my hon. Friend can satisfy me on those two matters, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton)--possibly unwittingly referred to my amendment No. 63, which is the Law Society's proposal. As he read the relevant extract from the Law Society's memorandum, I need say no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It pains me to stand in the same boat as the hon. Members for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I, too, managed to summon enough courage to read the Law Society's brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I always tell my trade union friends that what the Bar cannot teach trade unionists about the closed shop and the virtues of trade unionists sticking together is not worth knowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19 deals with the repayment supplement. The problem here is very narrow—that to be entitled to a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
repayment, the written instructions directing the making of the payment due must not be issued
	<br><q><p>"within the period of thirty days beginning on the day following the end"</p></q>
of the prescribed accounting period. The distinction made is that it is not enough for the Revenue simply to issue a written instruction directing the making of the payment, but that there should be an order for the payment of the amount due. That is to make sure that the Customs and Excise does not get the benefit of the distinction between a written instruction directing payment and the order for the payment of money. That is the purpose of the amendment, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply. As we have said on several occasions, when traders who—perhaps for good reasons—are the subject of heavy penalties for the non-payment of VAT are owed money by the Customs and Excise, similar provisions should apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These three linked amendments deal with a fairly narrow point, and we shall come to some of the wider issues later. Between the publication of the exposure clauses and the Bill, the word "order" has been replaced by "written instruction".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and others have wondered why that has happened. Customs and Excise was a computer system to deal with the three million or so claims for repayment of VAT that it receives each year. In clause 9 of the consultative paper, the word "order" was used. The change was made on the advice of parliamentary counsel that it could not be right in law that a trader's entitlement should depend upon a fact of which he could have had no knowledge: the date of the computer run when the order was issued. I am advised that "ordered to pay" can be construed in a technical sense to mean the issue of a negotiable instrument or cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not feasible for individual orders to pay to be made. A written instruction directing the making of the payment will be issued. That will permit a responsible Customs and Excise officer to initiate the repayments on each occasion on which they are to be made. The date of the written instruction will be printed on the payable orders—the cheques—and on the ad-vices issued when payment is effected through the banks' automated clearing system. Traders will, therefore, know when the authority to make the repayment is given and whether in each case an entitlement to repayment supplement has arisen. That is a protection for the trader. I shall come to the timing later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will feel that the written instruction will be fair to the traders concerned and I hope that the amendments will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister of State reconsider the matter? I appreciate that the words "order for payment" could be confused with a negotiable instrument, but I am sure that that problem could be solved with a different form of words and I do not think that that is a fundamental objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other objection was that an order for payment would not be known to the trader. That is not a reason why it should not be used. A trader would not necessarily know of a written instruction at the time that it was made. The fact that a trader would not know the precise time when the order for payment was issued, should not prevent Parliament legislating on the date from which it should run.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly give that assurance.
