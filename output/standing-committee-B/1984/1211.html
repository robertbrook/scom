<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [6 December], No. 8, in page 3, line 18, to leave out " may deal with " and insert " shall apply ".—[Mr. Gould.]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this, we are discussing amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 19, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>" in such manner as he thinks fit for "</p></blockquote>
and insert " to ".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recall that at our previous sitting I was referring to the business expansion scheme, which had been touched on by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), and I had suggested that perhaps he was underplaying the scheme's importance. I am anxious not to fall into the trap of exaggerating its importance, but I doubt whether hon. Members realise how exciting and revolutionary a scheme it is and of what benefit it could be to the film industry.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham referred to the fact that I mentioned the scheme in my Second Reading speech on the Floor of the House on 19 November. I was then unaware of exactly what success had been achieved through the business expansion scheme, because we were still awaiting certain figures from the Treasury. However, the autumn statement of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer contained some impressive figures, which he revealed to the House on 13 November and which may be of interest to the Committee.<br><br>
He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The House will be glad to know that we estimate that at least £75 million, and probably more, was raised by small businesses under the scheme in 1983-84. More than 10,000 investors have put their money into more than 400 small companies. Inevitably, the sums raised have varied enormously. About 30 per cent. of companies each raised f50,000 or less. About 60 per cent. raised between £50,000 and £250,000. A few raised more than £1 million each. Particularly encouraging is the fact that well over half the total amount invested—at least £41 million—went to young, or very young, start-up companies. The rest went to more mature, but still relatively small companies."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 November 1984; Vol. 67, c. 552.]</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
That underlines the point that I sought to make in Committee last Thursday, and also the point to which I was trying to draw the attention of the House on Second Reading. Those figures are impressive. Moreover, it must be remembered that the film industry fought long and hard to make sure that the industry would qualify under the business expansion scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould<span class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that the business expansion scheme is of considerable value, and, in the context of the film industry, of considerable value to certain types of film makers. Where I think that there is some doubt as to its efficacy is in respect of the middle-budget film. How does the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State see the scheme helping in that area? It is possible that the private company that might succeed the NFFC might wish to finance a series of films and would set up a sequence of individual companies—one company per project—so as to qualify under the scheme. However, that seems to be an extraordinary way in which to deal with the matter. I doubt whether such a method would commend itself to the Minister, nor would it seem to be consonant with the spirit of the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred again to the middle-budget film. I understand exactly the point that he was making. However, I was trying to make the point that many of the funds that have been raised under the business expansion scheme—some in excess of £2 million—could well finance films which could be regarded as being middle budget. Of course, it is early days for the business expansion scheme. In my opinion, the scheme is only in embryo form. It needs to be more dramatically pushed, perhaps by the Department of Trade and Industry. We need to increase awareness of the benefits to both the investor and to the target and qualifying company. However, as the film industry itself fought to qualify under the business expansion scheme, it is perfectly clear to me that the potential could be unlimited.<br><br>
Moreover, in his Second Reading speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) spoke of the financing of films. At the outset of that speech, he sought to make an important point, which I am prepared to accept, that the film industry is like no other industry. The point is obvious. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>" The film industry is quite different. It has an idea. Then it lavishes waves of creative talent on that idea. It embellishes it with the reputations of countless other talents—some celebrated and others perhaps entirely unknown. After a process combining cajolery, flattery, persuasion and exhortation, it raises funds of a size and enormity that would make Chancellors of the Exchequer and Secretaries of State blanch."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend put the point extremely well.<br><br>
There has been much discussion in the Committee about how difficult it could be for the film industry to raise finance. Indeed, later in his speech, my hon. Friend put the question:
<br><blockquote><p>" Where is the finance to come from?"</p></blockquote>
I suggest that he had already answered that question
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
in the early part of his speech, when he said that the industry
<br><blockquote><p>"raises funds of a size and enormity that would make Chancellors of the Exchequer and Secretaries of State blanch." —[Official Report, 19 November 1984; Vol. 68, cc.53–55.]</p></blockquote>
All I seek to emphasise is that the business expansion scheme, whether it is looked on as being pump-priming funds or as additional capital, will assist the film industry, and there has been no mechanism of that nature in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully and with interest to my hon. Friend, but he has left out his arithmetic the many independent producers who now make films. My hon. Friend's advice that the industry wanted the business expansion scheme may well have come from the remaining secure and somewhat larger companies, but I suggest that a great deal of production is done on a one-off independent producer basis. Can the independent producer really benefit from the business expansion scheme? Secondly, because of the high risk of film making, is the business expansion scheme, with its inevitable shroud of bureacracy, a suitable vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point out, first, that we are trying to cut down the bureaucracy in the business expansion scheme? I said that funds have already been established under the business expansion scheme approved by us in the Department of Trade and Industry, under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act. Clearly, £2 million is something of a portfolio. Amounts of approximately £100,000 will go to, each investment, and there are smaller sums than that. We are only talking here about funds, and in answer to what my hon. Friend says, it is perfectly possible, under the business expansion scheme, for one investor to invest directly in a small company, to take advantage of the tax relief that is now available to the film industry. Moreover, without going to the sophisticated level of a business expansion scheme fund, it is possible for some people to act as marriage brokers, bringing together potential investors and the film companies in which they can invest their money. I want to stress that few people realise the potential of this ingenious and imaginative scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that there is no intention of looking this gift horse in the mouth. Any gift horse is welcome. In his advocacy of the scheme and its advantages for the production of films, I wonder whether he has taken into account the fact that the scheme does not synchronise with the activity pattern of a film production company. As I understand it, the scheme requires that the investment should remain for five years and that throughout the five-year period the company benefiting from the investment should continue to practise the business for which the investment was made. But that is not the way films are made. It is not the time sequence in which films are made. A film producer may well move on within a couple of years to another project. The point I made earlier, perhaps the Minister will confirm this, is that it is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
possible to escape from some of these problems by setting up a second, third or fourth company for succeeding projects. I believe that the scheme precludes someone who has received investment under the scheme from setting up a second company for the same purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the point is valid in that the film industry, while it is delighted to be included under the business expansion scheme, is suggesting that there may be a degree of flexibility introduced so far as it applies to it or, perhaps, across the board. I take the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but it is not strictly correct to say that the money is locked in for a period of five years. The truth is that 100 per cent. tax relief is not enjoyed if the money is pulled out before that time has elapsed.<br><br>
The point that I was seeking to make earlier, and in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton), is that it is risk capital made available through the business expansion scheme. Numerous hon. Members have referred to the fact that the film industry is a risk industry. I accept that entirely. This scheme was designed to cater for such companies, and the wealth generation that will arise from it will provide investment for this important industry.<br><br>
On Second Reading my hon. Friend the Minister of State quoted from a leader in <i>The Times</i> which was published a week earlier. The leader said that the industry
<br><blockquote><p>" should certainly be thinking in terms of moving with the grain of the Government's policies to encourage enterprise and stimulate small businesses, instead of subconsciously pigeonholing itself as an art that needs support from the public purse "</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend continued:
<br><blockquote><p>" In the long run, the film industry will be healthy and prosperous only if it is able to attract private investment on its own merits ".</p></blockquote>
—[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 November 1984; Vol. 68, c. 38.] That is my point.<br><br>
On the substantive point the hon. Member for Dagenham made with regard to amendment No. 8, 1 do not believe that there is any difference, between the Government and the Opposition in wishing to see the assets of the NFFC used for the benefit of the British film industry. We may argue about the means, but we shall certainly not be arguing about the ends. However, I do not imagine that any of us would want to see the Secretary of State obliged to hand over the assets to the first person claiming to represent the British film industry. Yet, that is what the amendments, taken at face value, appear to suggest.<br><br>
I have been pressed by the hon. Member for Dagenham to set out how we intend to deal with the NFFC's assets. I shall make the Government's intention clear. On dissolution, the main elements of the NFFC's assets will comprise, first, cash in hand which is currently about £5 million, of which more than £3 million is earmarked to honour unfulfilled commitments by the NFFC to make loans. We intend to pass those commitments and the cash to meet them to the son of NFFC. Any remaining
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
uncommitted cash will be passed back to the British Film Fund Agency to be paid out to other recipients of the Eady levy. The main elements will also comprise the portfolio of film rights, including loans, and interest free payments due, which will also be made available to the son of NFFC.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for Dagenham queried whether in saying that the new company would have available double the funding available to the NFFC, we had counted in the profits, loan repayments and interest from the NFFC portfolio for the new company, but excluded it from the existing NFFC. We have excluded it from both so that we are comparing like with like—apples with apples. It seems reasonable to do so as the amount will be variable, whereas the others are fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of simple arithmetic, if we exclude that sum, which may be £200,000 or £600,000 a year, surely we are left with £l.5 million from the Eady levy. Is the Minister saying that the successor to the NFFC will be receiving £3 million?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain the sums in detail to assist the hon. Gentleman. He referred to the £600,000 in the portfolio of assets. In the White Paper, in the statement delivered to the House by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, and on Second Reading, it was explained that the private sector's annual contribution to the son of NFFC would be about £1.1 million or more, and that the Government's annual contribution would be £1.5 million. The Government would also make available 0.5 million each year for the project development scheme. It was, and it remains, our expectation that this work and the necessary funds should be handled by the son of NFFC. I must stress that we are talking about assured external funding. In addition the son, once it gets under way, will begin to generate internal income from the repayment of loans on film production. We hope that there will also be profits in due course. I remind the Committee that the NFFC's external funding has, since 1980, been £1.5 million a year. In addition, it also generates its own internal income from projects that it has backed.<br><br>
Comparing like with like, the external funding of the son of NFFC is, at 0.1 million a year, more than twice the sum available to the NFFC. In addition, the Government intend to make available to the son the NFFC's portfolio of rights and interests in about 800 films made since the late 1940s. In the White Paper, the portfolio of film rights was stated to have an income-generating capacity of more than £200,000 a year. That represents net profits.<br><br>
However, as we explained on Second Reading, we have decided that repayments of principal and interest should also be made to the new company. These are estimated to bring the total value of the portfolio—at least for the first two or three years—to about £600,000 a year. I hope that that gives the hon. Member for Dagenham the clarification that he was seeking.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
I accept the thrust of the argument presented by the hon. Member for Dagenham that the Secretary of State should perhaps be under a greater obligation to deploy the assets than the present drafting suggests. As presently drafted, it would be open to the Secretary of State to do absolutely nothing with the assets, using them neither for the film industry, nor for anyone else. That was never our intention. I believe that more of a duty should be placed on the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Amendment No. 8, in using the word " apply becomes somewhat ambiguous. But if the hon. Member for Dagenham will withdraw it, I shall undertake to table an amendment on Report carrying the same obligation. Unfortunately, amendment No. 9 would remove any element of discretion that the Secretary of State may have in any circumstances in which assets and liabilities are transferred from one body to another in future. I maintain that a degree of flexibility is vital. Placing more of a duty on the Secretary of State, as amendment No. 8 suggests makes the position clearer. I must therefore resist the removal of that discretion. I hope that in the light of the information and the undertaking that I have given, the hon. Member for Dagenham will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the information about the NFFC's assets, the proposed transfer of assets to the son of NFFC, and for his undertaking that the sense and purpose of amendment No. 8 will be introduced by the Government on Report. That is a substantial advance, for which we are grateful.<br><br>
However, I should like to push him a little further in connection with the drafting of the amendment that will fulfil his undertaking. I am somewhat fortified in the purpose that amendment No. 9 was intended to achieve by a brief that I, in common no doubt with other members of the Committee, received this morning from the Copinger Society—a body of solicitors practising in the entertainments and films industry. A number of purely technical and drafting amendments are proposed, one of which would have much the same purpose as amendment No. 9. When the Minister drafts his amendment to subsection (2), perhaps he bear in mind the society's suggestion that, after leaving suggests. As presently drafted, it would be open the words
<br><blockquote><p>" in such manner as he thinks fit"—</p></blockquote>
I can see that the Minister attaches importance to those words—the following words—<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>" for any purpose connected with "—</p></blockquote>
should be replaced by the words " in the interests of ". I see the point of the amendment. A " purpose connected with " does not necessarily have anything to do with promoting the interests of the industry. I offer the idea to the Minister as a reasonable compromise. There will be an obligation on the Secretary of State by virtue of the acceptance of amendment No. 8—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham(St. Helens, South)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that the Copinger Society makes a valid point? The words
<br><blockquote><p>" for any purpose connected with "</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
could be defined very broadly, so as to include giving the son or grandson of a former actor a present, for example, whereas " in the interests of ", as suggested by the society, implies the present British film industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. " Connected with " is a neutral term, which could embrace almost anything, whereas " in the interests of " has more of a teleological flavour, related to the promotion and development of the industry.<br><br>
If the Minister were prepared to accede to that argument the subsection would have the element of obligation, by virtue of the use of the word " shall " rather than the word " may "—I believe that the Minister accepts that change—and also the element of discretion, preserved by the words
<br><blockquote><p>" in such manner as he thinks fit ".</p></blockquote>
There would also be a limitation on the discretion in the form of an obligation to use the funds " in the interests of " the film industry. I invite the Minister to consider that possibility; it may commend itself to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier </span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has the advantage of me in that I have not seen the document to which he refers. However he asked me to bear the Copinger Society's suggested wording in mind, and I can certainly give such an undertaking. The hon. Gentleman referred to substituting the word " shall " for the word " may ". I am prepared to consider that seriously in connection with amendment No. 8, and was thinking along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Minister would concede that the essential purpose of amendment No. 8, which I think he finds defective, is to impose an obligation rather than to give a permissive power.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to comment on one further aspect. He purported to give us a comprehensive statement of the assets of the NFFC. I took notes, and find that only two categories of asset were listed—cash in hand and the film rights defined in subsection (4) and dealt with in subsection (3). Is the Minister sure that those are the only assets of the NFFC? I have always understood, for example, that the NFFC had a golden share in Shepperton Studios, which figured in the recent history of the film industry. Can he tell us what happened to that shareholding, if there are others, or any other forms of property, and what it is proposed to do with it all? On the face of it, such holdings would not fall within subsections (3) and (4), and so would have to be dealt with under the general provisions of subsection (2). We need to know what the Minister proposes to do with them. I remark in passing that the golden share seems an excellent precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall that when Lord Wilson, as he now is, was Prime Minister, he invoked the NFFC holding of a golden share in order to prevent developers from destroying parts of Shepperton Studios, which occupy a prime potential development site? Is not that an even greater reason why
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
we need clarification from the Government about the fate of the golden share on dissolution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend neatly illustrates the value of the principle of the golden share in the industry. The Minister must tell us what has happened to that share. Does the NFFC still hold it, and if so, what will happen to it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The NFFC holds the share, but it will not be transferred to the son of NFFC. It will go to the Secretary of State. I agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). We realised what a valuable asset that could be. <br><br>
I am anxious to assist the hon. Member for Dagenham further with answers to his earlier questions, so I shall break down the figures that I gave. The sums break down as follows, for external funding. There is to be £1·1 million in private contributions to the son of NFFC, and Government contributions of £1·5 million. The Government funded project development scheme, which is expected to be operated by the son, will receive £500,000. The total is therefore £3·1 million. We have stressed time and again that that is slightly more than twice the existing NFFC funding of £1·5 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: My mental arithmetic is not all that it should be, but there is a slight difficulty in arguing that resources available to the son of NFFC will be double those of the NFFC. If we counted the £600,000 on both sides rather than excluding it from both sides we would need more than £4 million to double the resources available to the current NFFC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried to make the point earlier that we were comparing like with like. We have removed the £600,000 in respect of both sides of the argument so that we are comparing like with like. As I said, that figure is variable.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am gratified that the Minister is at least prepared to move in the direction of amendment No. 8—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst<span class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, I should like to explain that it is not a question of comparing like with like, but of comparing like with inadequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am content to accept that gloss from the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not consider it in that light. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) makes a valid point. We must bear in mind that the NFFC was not adequately funded. The new body should be adequately and properly funded and our object is to see that the film industry is properly funded in future. I wish that we could find a name for this body rather than forever talking about the son or successor to the NFFC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that we shall have a further opportunity to discuss some of those points. His plea that the succesor should be given a name cannot be met by the Committee.

The company will be a private concern and I assume that it will be free to choose its own name as well as many other things. That is one of the aspects of the company that we shall wish to examine carefully. Having said that and accepting the Minister's assurance that he will table an amendment on Report to meet the purpose of amendment No. 8, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crowther. Perhaps I can raise this point of order now rather than in the middle of another amendment. I wish to apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) and to withdraw an inaccuracy with regard to our last sitting. In column 92, I quoted my hon. Friend as having said certain words in the long distance past with a view to devastating him in front of the Committee. I was totally wrong in my quotation. In fact the words that I quoted were said by Mr. Maurice Edelman, a late Labour Member. The words were not those of my hon. Friend the Member for Weal-den. As he lives in the present and future, and not the past, he did not seek to even check the quotation because he was unaware of the fact that what sounded like his own words were not.<br><br>
For the sake of the record, I should have quoted him as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>" There are many people in the television industry today "—</p></blockquote>
that was 20 years ago—
<br><blockquote><p>" who have left the film industry because, as the years went by, they found that it was an industry which did not nut a premium on integrity. They found that the interlocking financial interests created an atomsphere which was detrimental to real talent."— [<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1964; Vol. 688, c. 1094.] </p></blockquote>
I suspect that those words might not have devastated the Committee as much as those that I quoted. But I wish to have the record put straight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am far from convinced that that is a point of order. Nevertheless, I thought it appropriate to allow the hon. Gentleman to put the record straight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith<span class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like you, Mr. Crowther, I find it strange to regard that as a point of order, or even as an apology. However, I prefer to take it as an apology knowing that it is probably more wounding to my stature than my hon. Friend's previous remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No ruling is required on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 23, after " transferred ", insert
<br><blockquote><p>" for valuable consideration, the form and amount to be assessed by two independent auditors appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose and".</p></blockquote>
In some ways, subsection (3) brings us to the most curious part of the Bill, because it is here that the Government, at least partly, remove the veil from their intentions about what should replace the NFFC. One of the difficulties under which we labour is that the Bill does not go into detail. Perhaps it cannot do so because of the structure that the Gov-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
eminent propose to put in place of the NFFC. Because the Government are pining their hopes on a private company and intend to leave the NFFC with the status of a private company operating in its own commercial interests, one assumes that the Government have difficulty in laying down in statute any detail about that company's obligations, structure and so on, which we believe should be specified so that we can be sure of and have some confidence in the role of the successor organisation. Instead, we are merely given a hint, which is amplified somewhat in the White Paper, but only most sketchily, about how the company will operate. Nothing has been said to reassure us that the company will meet the purposes that we consider important.<br><br>
The amendment is directed at a narrow but important point. We have had to assume that some private commercial company, at some future date, will be formed in a manner consonant with some understanding reached by the Government with others in the industry. I am sorry to be so vague, but that is what we are faced with. If all that happens, the Secretary of State " may ", under subsection (3) transfer to such a company the assets of the NFFC.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State did us some service this morning by setting out the detail of some of the financial transactions involved. However, I fear that that has only enhanced our anxiety about the peculiar nature of the arrangement. First, it seems clear that the parties involved in the arrangement, especially Rank and Thom EMI, have already derived a benefit from the Bill. In a sense, they have already been relieved of the burden of paying the Eady levy. No doubt, they are grateful for that and are well inclined towards expressing their gratitude to the Government by undertaking a limited commitment to the future of the film industry. I would understand that to be the basis of their commitment jointly to supply about £850,000 a year for three years to some such company as that so vaguely indicated in the subsection.<br><br>
As for the other contributors—in particular, though I cannot recall the name of the body, the video cassettes producers' association, or whatever it is called—who are also likely to be involved in the undertaking, surely, it is worthwhile asking whether they, too, have not obtained a quid pro quo. I invite the Minister to comment on that matter. He may be aware of rumours that the video cassette producers have agreed to participate in such an arrangement because they, too, have received a sweetner, as it were, from the Government. In this instance it is not the removal of the Eady levy, but an assurance that in the future they will not be subjected to a levy. I invite the Minister of State to comment about the rumour and, if possible—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Norman Lamont)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am relieved to hear it.<br><br>
The extremely limited obligation undertaken by those who may well form such a company is already adequately compensated for by the concession
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0446">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
—or benefit—of removing the Eady levy. However, under the remaining financial arrangements, in addition to the advantage of no longer having to pay the levy, those who run the new company, according to the analysis of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State himself, are likely to receive £2 million of Government money—£1.5 million directly to the company and £0.5 million to the national film development fund, which will be under the control of the successor body. Moreover, they are likely to have transferred to them the substantial assets at present belonging to the NFFC, and these assets are so substantial that they will produce an income of £600,000 a year. Why should those large sums—not so much the Government money, because we accept that that might well be paid for the sake of the future health of the industry —at present belonging to one public-sector corporation be transferred to a private company for absolutely no valuable consideration?<br><br>
On Second Reading, after I had expressed some concern about the matter, the Minister of State intervened—unfortunately, from a sedentary position —to the effect that assets would not be transferred in the sense of ownership but that they would merely be lent on trust, as it were, to the successor company, so that income would be produced, but the ownership of the assets would not be transferred. That was my understanding of what he said. I hope that his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State will comment on that. Unfortunately, the intervention was not recorded in <i>Hansard,</i> because it was made from a sedentary position. If the assets are not to be transferred to the ownership of the successor body, what will the transfer arrangement be? Who will own them? There are many unanswered questions, and we hope that we shall be given answers to them.<br><br>
Irrespective of the answers to questions about ownership, the fact remains that for as long as the company deigns to continue its limited involvement in the film industry, it will benefit from the income of the assets, although no compensating payment will be paid to the public purse or to the film industry which, through the Eady levy, has built up the assets over many years. So in equity, as well as for policy reasons, we are entitled to ask the Minister why he does not expect this commercial company to pay a commercial price for valuable commercial property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add one or two thoughts on the creation of the son of NFFC. Perhaps the Government should think longer and harder about the purposes of the company and how it should be constituted.<br><br>
It worries me that the deal with the big or medium four who are to take over the NFFC seems to have been negotiated before this Committee stage, instead of during or after it. It smells slightly of a pre-fix of some sort, and that concerns me. I am also concerned that one of the main participants—Rankshows every sign of being completely out of film production. Is that the right sort of main partner to have in a thriving son of NFFC, which is meant to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>encourage British production? Moreover, the associations of the other three should be looked at.<br><br>
My main worry relates to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister of State on Second Reading, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>,,we think that by being rooted in the private sector the new company will bring a commercial edge to its operations."— [<i>Official Report,</i> 19 November 1984; Vol. 68, c. 36.]</p></blockquote>
I applaud that remark, but would there not be a greater commercial edge if the company, instead of being confined to four closed participants, were opened up to the public and the shares put on sale, as with British Telecom, to the small investor? Why should not the film fan invest in his interest and be able to pick up £200 worth, or £500 worth of shares in British films perhaps on the slight guaranteed reward of a few free seats each year and the chance of a big dividend if that company made a profit? The small investor could then get involved in a big way and in the sort of way that we have talked about in other sections of the Bill, to create the fund needed.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Capitalisation of a successful British film investment company would seem to me to need something in the region of £25 million to produce 10 or 12 feature films a year and possibly six shorts. We are talking about £25 million not £6 million or £3 million. I believe that there is enough interest from the small investor to move in that direction.<br><br>
The stranglehold—one has to use that word—that would inevitably occur if the interested parties were Rank, Thorn EMI, the British Videogram Association and Channel 4 would narrow the purpose of what I see as the virtue of this company. Will my hon. Friend the Minister give more thought to that and seriously consider opening up the opportunities of this company to many more people, making it public and thus giving the small investor the chance to invest? The entertainment business never really worked when it was run by committees. So could the company be made by law to appoint one chief executive and to give him the sole power of directing the funds of that company without the veto of the board? To cover the board, if it felt strongly that the chief executive was going astray, some method of appeal would need to be written into that law. I believe that the entertainment business, particularly the film business, has been ruined by committees in the past and that we need some sort of benevolent dictator. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give serious consideration to those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about being party to a Bill that leaves more questions unanswered than answered. Earlier this morning I commented that we ought to give the son of NFFC a name. That was not just an amusing aside but a realistic comment. Not only ought we to give it a name but we should know what form or skeleton shape it will take. For example, we do not know whether it will be a company limited by guarantee shares, or a company incorporated with a shareholding. If it is the latter, what is the size of its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0447">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
shareholding, its nominal capital, its issued shareholders? Will it merely be restricted to the great four—if we can put it that way? If it is so restricted, I can see the seeds of the company's own destruction being sown. Indeed, there is a great incentive for the participators, to use whatever moneys the company has available in order to fund their own projects. That temptation could be overwhelming in commercial terms.<br><br>
We do not know what will be contained in the company's Memorandum of Articles or what the objectives of the company will be. Will it merely exist for the production of new films? If so, what sort of films? What sort of entrepreneurial and adventurous steps will it take, if any? What restriction do the Government have once they have created the company? At present, they can withdraw the copyright of old films which will give the company its income. I noticed when my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was speaking, that the concept of the lease, or of the loaning of the income that is derived from the 800 films that the NFFC now has, was merely to be passed over. If the son of NFFC decided that it would buy into the hamburger market instead of funding the production of new films it appears that the Government's only sanction would be to withdraw that income which amounts, apparently, to about £600,000 a year. The original capital base would still be there. Therefore, the son of NFFC would no longer be acting in the way that its parent wished. As the Bill stands, the Government could do little about it.<br><br>
What happens if the new body is not a success? What will happen to the money poured into it? Who will pick up the tab? If mistakes are made in its management and direction, the company will be liquidated. We need a guarantee that the film rights which are really state assets, will be preserved and not passed to the creditors.<br><br>
It seems that this skeleton needs to be fleshed out before the Bill is passed. To do otherwise would be commercial folly. The Committee has the right to know how the body will be constructed. The hon. Member for Gravesham—(Mr. Brinton) may disagree about the ownership of shares and so on, but he wonders whether it will be open to others to participate in the capital structure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he is drifting into the next group of amendments. We are dealing with amendment No. 10 which is narrow in its scope, and I hope that hon. Members will keep to it. There will be ample opportunity for a wider discussion when we reach the next group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always accept your rulings on these will matters, Mr. Crowther. Perhaps my comments give the Minister a foretaste of what is to come. The point that I am making on the amendment would not have made sense if I had not referred to, the commercial aspects.<br><br>
While the Minister may not like the wording of amendment No. 10, I am always happy to listen to alternatives so long as the principle is accepted.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
It should be written into the Bill that the right being transferred must either be " for valuable consideration " or transferred in such a way that the assets can be recouped by the State, which can set up an alternative system to ensure that the aims of the son of NFFC will be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The name for the progeny born out of wedlock is not "son". I shall forbear the use of language that could be regarded as unseemly. Although the son of NFFC had a mother, I believe that the father left six weeks before my hon. Friend the Minister took over. Therefore, it is legitimately to be regarded as a bastard arrangement.<br><br>
The arrangement desperately needs proper parents who are not just living in a common-law arrangement with each other. To pursue the analogy, it should be legitimised with a proper dowry. That is where the relevance of the amendment arises, in that it contains the words " for valuable consideration". In my language, that is a dowry. Furthermore, a binding marriage contract is required. All that is involved here is living together—I shall not say " in sin ", but living together for three years, after which the common-law arrangement seems to be dissoluble.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will address himself to one matter, in that the arrangement seems to contain only a three-year commitment. What will follow if the parties to it want to go their own separate ways? We must face the fact that they are a pretty disparate lot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because I hops to catch your eye, Mr. Crowther, on the next group of amendments to discuss matters of greater substance relating to the future body. However, an important issue is enshrined in this amendment, and I hope that the Government will give us an assurance in that regard.<br><br>
We have been told that the income deriving from the rights to about 800 films will be transferred in some way. In that connection, I look forward to hearing the Minister's answers to the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). The rights will be transferred to the new body. As the clause is at present drafted, there is some reliance on the goodwill of the parties involved in the transaction. The amendment seeks to bring into a system that at present totally relies on good will the concept of independent auditors appointed by and therefore responsible and answerable to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Let us consider briefly the nature of the good will. We are told by the Government that the willingness of Rank and Thorn EMI to put £600,000 into the new body shows a certain amount of good will. On the face of it, that may well be true, but if we examine the financial circumstances of Thom EMI and Rank, we find that they will be relieved, by the lifting of the Eady levy, of the responsibility of paying £3 million or so each year into the British film industry—primarily through the NFFC, but also through one or two other arrangements. If cinema admission prices were reduced by the amount saved
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
by the lifting of the Eady levy, the argument would not stand, but we understand from statements made by Thorn EMI and Rank that they do not intend to do that. If so, their contribution of £600,000 will be substantially less than the contribution which, by statutory arrangement, they have hitherto been forced to make. So the issue of good will must raise questions in our mind, bearing in mind the nature of the good will that those companies demonstrate at present. Thus, the transaction between the NFFC— and the rights now pertaining to that corporation—and the new body requires greater care and attention than seem to be afforded in the Bill as it stands.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to allay the fears expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) when he said that the Government should think carefully about the successor body. I assure my hon. Friend that we shall. I take on board his comment that the entertainment business has not been successfully run by committees in the past, and I am sure that he is right that that will not happen in future, either.<br><br>
My main means of reassuring my hon. Friend must be to tell him that it is not the intention of the Government nor of the original prospective participants in the son of NFFC that the successor body should be in any way a closed shop. We would welcome the participation of others. That may reassure the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), too.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said that the body needed parents, and to be legitimised. He would probably accept that we intend to keep an open mind at this stage. I emphasise again that the body will not be a closed shop. My hon. Friend also asked what would follow after three years. My hon. Friend the Minister of State will deal with that question in some depth in replying to the next set of amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said that Rank and Thorn EMI would benefit from the ending of the Eady levy. Both hon. Members seem to have missed the fact that as film producers and distributors, both those companies will also lose from the termination of the levy.<br><br>
In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Dagenham, we are not aware that it was a condition of the British Videogram Association's proposed contribution to son that an undertaking was given that video cassettes would not be levied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used a curious phrase there, when he said " we are not aware " of any such condition. If anyone is aware of such an arrangement, he must be. Is he giving us an assurance that there was no such conversation and no such undertaking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no such undertaking.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to prevent the Secretary of State from transferring the former assets of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
NFFC to the successor company unless it is in return for valuable consideration as assessed by independent auditors. I assume from the nature of the amendment that the intention is for some cash payment or, to use the hon. Gentleman's word " consideration ", to be necessary, although I am advised that the term " valuable consideration " can include a variety of other transactions. However, let us leave that aside for the moment and consider the amendment's intention.<br><br>
The usable assets which will vest in the Secretary of State upon the winding up of the NFFC will comprise the following three categories. First, there will be the portfolio of film rights, or interests, in the films financial or usually part-financed, by the NFFC since its formation in 1949. That is thought to be worth an income of about £600,000 a year for the first couple of years. Secondly, there will be cash in hand, for which commitments have been made to film producers for future loans. We cannot say what that will be when the NFCC is dissolved but it is currently about £3·3 million. Thirdly, there will be uncommitted cash, currently about £1·7 million.<br><br>
In the Second Reading debate I set out very clearly our intentions for each of those elements as and when they become vested in the Secretary of State. Uncommitted cash would be transferred into the BFFA to be added to the moneys paid to eligible British films under the present Eady distribution rules. The cash already earmarked for specific forward commitments is to be made over to son of NFFC but I emphasise that with that cash will be transferred the NFFC's contractual liabilities to make loans for that amount to co-finance films. This is no give-away to the new company, but a practical and sensible solution to the problem of ensuring some continuity between the old NFFC's operations and those of the new company.<br><br>
The final element is the portfolio of rights and interests, which I take it is the principal concern behind the amendment. The amendment seeks to alter the provision in the Bill whereby the Secretary of State may make the NFFC's portfolio of rights available to the Son of NFFC, by inserting a provision requiring the portfolio of rights to be sold for valueable consideration. That would restore the position in the existing law which the Government wish to change. It would mean that the NFFC's portfolio of rights would be sold off and the sale price paid to the Government, who, under clause 3(2), would then have to hand the money back to Son of NFFC or its equivalent for any purpose connected with the British film industry. It is unlikely that there would be any buyers. The effect of the amendment would be that the Government would have to administer the portfolio with little benefit to the film industry.<br><br>
The other requirement of the amendment—that two independent auditors should assess the value of the portfolio—has never been felt to be necessary in films legislation since 1957, when the original power to sell the portfolio was given to the Secretary of State. Successive Labour Governments saw no reason to change the provisions. The only reason
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0449">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
for such a change now is the suggestion that the Government would sell the assets at an undervalue. That would never ever be our policy. Indeed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What? Since when?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sale of the portfolio is not our policy. The easy option would be to sell the portfolio, hand the money over and have no proper control of the future use of the portfolio for the benefit of British film production. That is not the Government's policy. We want to play an active part in assisting British film production. Our policy of retaining ownership of the NFFC's portfolio of rights but allowing its use by the Son of NFFC, subject to the requirement that the Son of NFFC will use its best endeavours to encourage the production and financing of British films, is the right way in which to assist the British film industry.<br><br>
The whole idea is to inject more resources into Son of NFFC to maximise its impact and, let me be frank, attract more investment for the production of British films. It hardly makes sense to start the process by extracting from Son of NFFC the very funds that we are trying to build up. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I well understand what the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State is a little sensitive about straying into the area of selling off assets at an undervalued price. He put up a curious defence. He said, " No, no. In no circumstances must you accuse us of selling the assets at too low a price because we are giving them away. That is vastly different." We are making exactly that point.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said that there is little a precedent for appointing two auditors to determine a fair price, but, surely he did so simply because it is not the usual practice for Governments or anyone else simply to give away assets. It is precisely because the Government clearly propose to give away assets that we were obliged to table the amendment.<br><br>
The Minister said that if the amendment were carried it would restore the existing position. I am not quite sure that I take his point. However, I am clear that the amendment would restore normal commercial practice. Why on earth should valuable commercial assets be given away? They must have a price. Any capital asset that produces £600,000 a year in income if reasonably managed will have a market value. Why are we not getting that market value for those assets? It is no answer for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, or anyone, to say, " But we are giving them away to a special company that will undertake especially onerous commitments." Nothing in the Bill says that.<br><br>
Consideration of what the arrangement should be between the Government and the company is extremely important for such reasons as those mentioned by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). Moreover, when one studies what the company will be doing, it is difficult to understand what distinguishes one company from another. Why
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
should not another group of people interested in film production come together and say, " We are the company will be doing, it is difficult to understand intend to spend on film production. Why should not we have £600,000 worth of assets plus some Government funding and control of the national film development fund so that we can train our own producers and others in the industry?" Why should the Committee, and the industry, be hooked on some private deal between the Minister and a group of people in the industry who are already powerful? Why should that group set itself up as recipients for this largesse?<br><br>
It is that problem which the Government must resolve. That is why the question of consideration —some price to be paid—is so important. It is the legitimising factor, to use the words of the hon. Member for Hendon, North. Otherwise, the Government are simply giving away things to their pals in the industry. It is no answer for the Government to say, " No, no. We are not giving it away because those people will do all sorts of wonderful things." Nothing anywhere says that they will do them. Moreover, even if they did, they would be doing them anyway, in their own interests, and they would be doing them for only three years and with no commitment to go beyond that.<br><br>
What would happen if, after three years, those people have coolly gobbled up £1·8 million worth of income from the assets by spending the money on any purpose that they care to select, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) rightly said, and then said, " We were very glad to have had the money. We did our best. It didn't work out. Thank you very much"? What then happens?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree that, if there were a return on investment of about 8 per cent., £600,000 a year would represent a capital asset of about £7 million? Moreover, it would form a chargeable asset against which further money can be borrowed. It is like taking pennies from a child. Does not my hon. Friend agree that it is ridiculous? It should be tightened up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. With respect, the Minister is talking commercial nonsense in suggesting that such income-producing capacity has no market value. It is absolute rubbish. If I were a business man, on the strength of such guaranteed income, I could borrow from a bank many times the sum of £600,000 if I could say that I had an asset that would produce that annual sum, without mentioning the public money and so on, which is to be diverted not for the purposes of some publicly accountable institution to promote the film industry's interests, but to a private commercial company.<br><br>
Only if some proper commercial arrangement is made can we, or anyone, be assured that there is some purpose in selecting that particular company. If a company is willing to pay the price, at least it will have reached base 1—at least we know that it is prepared to make a commitment. It is in business to do the things that we think ought to be done. However, if the company simply accepts without a

price being paid and agrees to spend £1.1 million a year for three years, it will have made virtually no commitment. Moreover, £1·1 million is a trivial sum to spend in such a short time, especially as it would be spent on purposes that the company would want to achieve, and bearing in mind all the other considerations that it would be receiving.<br><br>
The Minister must say why a proper price is not to be paid for public assets being transferred, not at large, but to particular beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that there would be no market. I said that it was unlikely that there would be any buyers. The hon. Gentleman is making a supposition by saying that that would be a price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall offer £5 now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: not enough!<br><br>
I am anxious to stress that some of the money has been taxpayers' money. Some of the money has come through the Eady levy. In other words, it has come from the cinemagoers. We do, not believe it right to tackle the problem in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. We believe that we. should keep control over it, and the money generated will go towards the future of the British film industry.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee on this point. Perhaps I was being inattentive, but I believe that the Minister said that the Government would keep control over the assets. Can he elaborate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The assets will be vested in the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will be vested in the Secretary of State. He will hand them over to the successor company which will manage the portfolio of assets and take the income over a period of three years. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The company will derive that income as a reward for managing the portfolio and it will receive £600,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we would be much more satisfied if the ownership remained with the Secretary of State and the company had a licence to manage fora definitive period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Analogies have been pouring in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Br. Bermingham) is valid, as that is the position. If that allays his fears, we are making progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could elaborate. We are anxious to ensure that there is some real nexus between the assets and the public purposes to which they should be devoted, and the company. One way would be to accept the amendment whereby the company would have to pay a commercial price
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
for the use of the assets, whatever the price. I have no doubt that an actuary could work it out perfectly well. The City is familiar with such questions. Alternatively, we could use the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). Rather as licences or franchises are granted for the right to exploit public property —for example, North sea oil concessions—the company should pay a fee for the right to manage and derive the income from those public assets. If the Minister is saying that that is what will happen, we shall need more details about the arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help the hon. Gentleman by suggesting that the Minister's proposal is fair when we take on board the fact that the disparate lot in this marriage, are taking on an unusual risk? Therefore, if they are reinforced by some assets for the exceptional risks, which film-making inevitably involves, that may be an exceptional explanation for an exceptional arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to push that reasoning too far. If what he says is right, it is evident that the British film industry is in an even more parlous state than the delicate condition suggested by the Minister in an earlier sitting. It suggests that we are desperate for someone to make a film, and that the person or company would have to take such enormous risks that the whole thing has to be sweetened by a little douceur of £600,000 per annum of public money. If that is so, we might as well kiss goodbye to the film industry now. But that is not so—at least, I hope not. There are people, including Rank and Thorn EMI, who are intent on making films and are prepared to take the commercial risks on an ordinary commercial reckoning. No one doubts that Rank and Thorn EMI will make films, but why should they—for the sake of spending money that they will spend anyway—be singled out from all other film makers, who will also make films and take the commercial risks, to receive gratis a substantial income-producing chunk of public assets? That is the simple question. The only justification for singling them out is that they will pay a price for it or that they will undertake some unusual commitment or obligation which they would not otherwise undertake. But the Minister has not said that.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is some inconsistency, in the hon. Gentleman's argument. On the one hand, he wishes the son of NFFC to be a success, but on the other he says that something is being given away to it, and he strongly objects to that. He mentioned the two companies that have been referred to time and again this morning. The point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grave-sham (Mr. Brinton)—and I replied to it—that we seek a wider participation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'> rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, we have delayed far too long on this matter, and I am not sure that the point I am answering is not outside the amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0451">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
I shall try again to reassure hon. Members that the portfolio is not being given away. It will revert to the Secretary of State if the son of NFFC abuses its powers or goes out of business. It is a form of aid intended to ensure that the portfolio is properly managed and that the son of NFFC gets off to a good start.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asume that the Minister intended to elaborate the remarks that he made to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) about the management fee that the company would pay. Can he enlighten us in that respect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we are going round in circles. If I have understood the Minister correctly, I am satisfied by what he said. He is saying that the income-generating ability of the portfolio will lie with the son of NFFC so long as that body maintains and adheres to the principles on which it was set up, but that the ownership of the assets, the copyright, will remain with the Secretary of State. If we asked the son of NFFC to pay a management fee for using the income that those assets generate, it would diminish the amount given to the son of NFFC and be counter-productive.<br><br>
If I have understood the position correctly, I am quite satisfied with it. The income is being lent to the company while it adheres to its objectives. The minute that it breaks from them, the income cessates but the ownership of the assets remains in the hands of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being misled—as is the Minister—by the concept of ownership. It is immaterial whether ownership is being transferred. What matters is that a piece of commercially valuable property is being transferred. The right to the income from the assets is a commercial property of considerable value. I invite the Minister to focus on that aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point that the property is the property of the film industry being used for the benefit of the film industry, and it will continue to be used for the benefit of the film industry. The hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) understands me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'> rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty in remembering who is speaking and who is intervening. I think I am right in saying that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is speaking. If the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) wishes to be called later, he will probably catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the Minister, there is nothing in the Bill, and we have heard nothing so far, to guarantee that the commercially valuable income-producing asset being handed over to this company will be used by that company for the purposes that he regards as important. Nor is there any reason to distinguish this company from any other company involved in a similar undertaking—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is leaping ahead, because that is the subject of the next group of amendments. Again, I carry his hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: But we cannot avoid that, because we cannot consider this question in isolation from the general function of the successor company.<br><br>
I come back to my argument. Why should not another company come along and say, " We are in the business of film production. We shall produce £1.1 million"? Why should it not be Goldcrest? Goldcrest could say, " We qualify. We will have the income and spend it in a perfectly sensible way." Why should not that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because I do not wish to prolong the debate. I am in a dilemma that has been accurately reflected by the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould).<br><br>
Of course, my hon. Friend the Member for St Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) is right. If we can be satisfied that the film rights will remain vested in the Secretary of State, that the income deriving from those rights will be devoted to the new body, and—here is the point—that it will be devoted to the promotion and benefit of the British film industry, there is no argument between the two sides of the Committee. Our problem is that with the arrangement in the Bill, with the present wording of the latter part of clause 3, yet to be debated, we cannot be satisfied that the new body will operate according to those principles. That is why in this amendment—which, to a certain extent, has to be prejudge decisions that we shall make later—we are so concerned about the granting of income to a body, when we are extremely unhappy about the structure of that body, as set out later in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) says:
<br><blockquote><p>,,on such conditions as he"—</p></blockquote>
the Minister—
<br><blockquote><p>" thinks fit, to any British company in whose case he is satisfied as to the following matters, namely—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) that the company will use its best endeavours to encourage the production of relevant films on a commercially successful basis; and "—</p></blockquote>
this is the Bill as it stands, unamended—
<br><blockquote><p>"(b) that it is willing and able to make financial facilities available to persons who wish to arrange for the production of relevant films ".</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend accept from me that that is exactly what the Minister has been saying? The income will go to the company that is set up to promote the production of films, and will stay there only as long as it carries out that objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to my hon. Friend, he is talking about discussions that are yet to come, about the legal obligation on any successor body or new company that is set up, and about how it carries out the functions which are enshrined in fine words in the clause, but which do not impose a duty to do so in as tight and independent a manner as we would wish. We shall come to that debate later.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0452">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
That is why I and, I suspect, my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham, find ourselves in a dilemma over the amendment. If we could secure changes in the wording of later parts of the clause, I would be happy to accept the Minister's assurances and the formula that he suggests for the transfer of assets. However, if that does not happen and the clause remains unamended, after all our discussions, we shall need a far more stringent analysis of how the transfer takes place than exists in the present wording of this part of the clause.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can solve the dilemma in a simple way. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) could withdraw the amendment, perhaps, while reserving the right to reintroduce it on Report. This argument may have been taken too early and perhaps should have come after the structure of the successor to the NFFC had been formed. But, Mr. Crowther, we are not masters of the list from which you select your amendments. Therefore, I suggest tentatively to my hon. Friends that that might be an honourable solution to the dilemma of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The selection of the amendments is in my hands but the order in which they are debated is not. Amendments must be debated in the order in which they relate to the Bill. I thought that I ought to make that clear to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman was referring to the fact that Mr. Speaker's selection might play a major part on Report, as well as your own selection, Mr. Crowther.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not suggest for one moment, Mr. Crowther, that you had arranged to put us in this dilemma. That was not the implication. I accept unreservedly that the amendments must follow the order in the Bill. I was merely suggesting to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham an honourable way of resolving this dilemma and securing his point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine, and hope, that this might be the last brief contribution to the debate.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South is right to say that by virtue of the way in which the amendments have been drafted and have come up, we are in this difficulty. The problem that I face, and share with my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), is that the Minister has said nothing that takes us beyond what is already in clause 3.<br><br>
If we were confident of having a successor to the NFFC which would in some legally binding way accept major obligations to the future of the British film industry, such as to bring it, in a sense, into the public realm, there would be little point in pressing the amendment. But since the Minister has been unable to suggest—perhaps he will not—that he will accept any successive amendments to the clause, we axe left to deal with the clause as it appears in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
Bill. Therefore, I believe that all the arguments which I have adduced retain their validity. On that ground, although I am very sensitive to the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South, I do not propose to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould </span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be with relief that the Committee moves on to what is in effect the meat of the debate on clause 3 and to look at the real issues involved in trying to set up a successor body to the NFFC. As the earlier debate showed, we are still having difficulty in understanding what the Government are trying to achieve. My understanding is that we have a curious hybrid proposition for a private commercial company to operate in its own commercial interests and to be active in an area in which it is already active. It is to be the beneficiary of substantial sums of public money and will undertake by virtue of an agreement with the Minister which we are not party to, some vague obligations to do things that it would do anyway.<br><br>
It is almost impossible to envisage the Government amending the Bill in such a way as to incorporate some of the legally binding obligations that we would wish. That would run counter to the Government's whole policy and the thrust of what they are trying to hand over responsibilty for the British film industry and its future to a private commercial company. There is no baulking that fact. That is what the Bill is about. As soon as one tries to ensure that the private company undertakes some commitments of a public nature, one fundamentally changes the instrument chosen by the Government. And yet, that is the problem that faces the Committee. How do we ensure that after three years, instead of the company saying, " thank you very much, we are glad to have the money but we now find that we prefer not to proceed, " some arrangement is made which will guarantee future investment in the British film industry?<br><br>
We are entitled to answers to those questions and I am sure that the Minister intends to give us those answers. What will happen after three years if the company says, " that's that. We no longer have any intention of proceedings."? What will the Minister do to convert the pious hopes in clause 3(3) into real commitments? My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) quoted some of the provisions of clause 3(3), but it is worth bearing in mind that those provision are not drafted in terms of any obligation—legally biding or otherwise—on the part of the successor company. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
clauses says that the Minister may pass over certain assets of the company which he shall indentify as likely to " use its best endeavours " or,
<br><blockquote><p>" willing and able to make financial facilities available"</p></blockquote>
That contains no language of obligation or commitment whatsoever. All the clause does is to lay a permissive power on the Secretary of State to cast his eye around and identify the lucky recipients of his largesse. The recipients undertake no obligation of any sort. Far from being an obligation, there is no legally binding element in the provision. That is what is curious about it. The Minister will have to work hard to explain how he sees the arrangement turning out.<br><br>
The problem is that without a legally binding provision, simple identification and the discretion of the Minister about some company is no assurance that that company will do what we regard as necessary. For example, under the provision as drafted the company will be accountable to no-one for the money that it receives. It will receive £1.5 million a year for itself. It will receive £500,000 a year to manage what everyone regards as an extremely valuable facility—the national film development fund. There is no guarantee that that fund will be managed properly in the interests of the film industry and will not simply become a training school for the companies involved. There will be no obligation to account for the profits made by the company on the strength of the assets that it has received from the public purse. The trading profit made with the £2 million of public money and the £600,000 worth of income may go into video cassettes or something totally unrelated. Thom EMI is a very large conglomerate. There is no assurance that the money will be spent on the film industry for any length of time, and no means of knowing what has happened to the money. The provision is entirely defective in that respect.<br><br>
It is left to the company, completely unfettered by any obligation, to pursue its commercial interests. Nothing in the Bill compels it to pay any attention to the future health of the industry. All that is required is that the Minister should say, " You look a likely lot; I think that you might do a good job for us. Here is the money." That is the legal position. There is nothing to guarantee that those who run the company—the chief executive, for example—will be anything other than a creature of the constituent parts of the major shareholders of the company, that they will do anything other than serve the interests and do the bidding of Thom EMI or Rank.<br><br>
Those matters must be dealt with in the Bill before we can be satisfied that the Government's proposals are acceptable. Amendment No. 11 attempts, admittedly in a rather long-winded fashion, to deal with some of them. It would provide a principle of accountability. At least there would be a statutory obligation that the money be spent to promote the film industry. The amendment also tries to ensure that the successor company will have a statutory duty to pay at least some regard to the promotion of the British film industry. Those are mild and permissive terms; we are not trying to tie the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0454">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
company hand and foot. The amendment also tries to ensure that the chief executive will not be simply the creature of the powerful companies that make up the successor company.<br><br>
The amendment thus seeks to achieve essential and irreducible objectives, without which the successor company will be nothing more than something which is here today and could be gone tomorrow, having in the meantime walked off with a considerable sum of public money and destroyed the future of the British film industry.<br><br>
In the group of amendments several other ways of achieving a similar result are suggested. I wish to draw special attention to amendment No. 40, tabled by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), and amendment No. 36, tabled by the Opposition, which seeks to achieve a similar objective. I have little preference between the two amendments. Both represent a way of introducing an institutional guarantee that some of our objectives would be met, and that the public interest would not be entirely lost sight of.<br><br>
We have still to hear the persuasive arguments of the hon. Member for Hendon, North, which may lend additional support. Moreover, there are precedents both in the industry—that has already been referred to this morning—and in the Government's own practice over privatisation of public enterprises. With all those encouragements the Minister may be prepared to examine the idea as a possible solution to the problem. Whatever he says, I hope that he tells the Committee that he recognises the importance of our objectives. Our previous debate made even clearer the vital importance of writing into the Bill an element of public accountability and responsibility to the industry.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has spoken with a reasonableness which my hon. Friend the Minister of State is probably not accustomed to hearing, even from me. I agree with what I have heard, and do not wish to go over too much of the same ground. I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to accept the idea. He is surrounded by people accustomed to saying, " Yes, Minister " to him, and today he is reinforced by others who have a fictional association with saying, " Yes, Minister ". I therefore hope that he will be encouraged to say yes to his Back Benchers and to the Opposition, as well as enjoying the habitual deference that he receives from other quarters.<br><br>
The purpose of my amendment is to create a share with a special protective power. I pray in aid a respectable precedent which I should like to quote in full, because it would set out exactly what we seek, if the words " son of NFFC " were substituted for the words " British Lion ", and the word " Government " substituted for the word " NFFC ".<br><br>
When the Government sold off the public shareholding in British Lion 20 years ago, my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
<br><blockquote><p>" I believe that the independence of British Lion depends on... the conditions that we propose to stipulate for its purchaser."</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend spelt out the precise conditions, and as they are relevant today I shall read them out, too:
<br><blockquote><p>" by the device of holding a single special share in the company, the NFFC should retain certain rights. These rights will include the right to veto the company's voluntary liquidation, the right to veto the sale of its undertaking, the right to veto the repayment of any capital to shareholders and any disposal of its interest in Shepperton Studios Ltd., except in defined circumstances which would be in the judgement of the special shareholder …<br><br>
The Corporation will also have the right to nominate a director to the board so that the Corporation and the Government will be fully apprised at all times of the conduct of its affairs.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>These provisions, which will be permanently effective, should ensure that no purchaser of British Lion shares can strip it of its assets or do anything but continue to operate it as a going concern. It will also mean that no cash made from an authorised sale of any assets can be removed from the business without the agreement of the NFFC.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In addition, the purchasers will be required to give positive assurances … that British Lion will continue to provide the facilities "—</p></blockquote>
in the present case, that would mean finance—
<br><blockquote><p>for independent producers."—[Official Report, 4 February 1964; Vol. 688, c.1074, 1076–7.1</p></blockquote>
As I said, for " British Lion " read " son of NFFC ", and for " NFFC " read " a Government nominated director ". Opposition amendment No. 36 and my amendment No. 40 seek similar if not identical arrangements for son of NFFC as were made for British Lion. The consequences of acceptting either amendment would be various. Amendment No. 11, which refers to the chief executive in paragraphs (b) and his annual report in paragraph (d), becomes far less important and necessary, and amendment No. 13, which requires a representative of film producers, equally pales into relative insignificance, if a referee is nominated by the Government. Amendment No. 14 intends to encourage new film makers and amendment No. 15 calls for an independent chairman. They are of as little importance in the light of a Government referee.<br><br>
I should like to refer to the chief executive. What I am about to say will also apply to a lesser extent, to an independent chairman. The chief executive is of crucial importance to the son of NFFC. He is as important to the NFFC as the Prince is in any production of " Hamlet ". The chief executive probably does not exist—I do not believe that he can be created because he would be a man of such exceptional talent that the British film industry could not afford to pay him and the American film industry would, almost certainly, have bought him. Nevertheless, the qualifications for the job are extremely important. His independence is no less vital than his qualifications. He must combine a knowledge of the film industry with creative perception and commercial judgement. He must comprehend the past of the British film industry. He must be able to interpret its present and have crystal-gazing qualities for forecasting its future. He must have the ebullience, resilience, experience and flair of Alexander Korda, Sidney Bernstein and Lew
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0455">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
Grade. It must be apparent to the Committee that such a man will be extremely hard to find.<br><br>
What I have said also underlines what lies at the heart of successful film making. It emphasises the distinction between films for cinema and films for television. It shows in stark terms the difference between normal manufacturing and the abnormality of film making. The two are not manufacturing processes. We are all agreed about that. Judgment, flair and perception are the first ingredients. Indeed, they are prerequisites for the person who is to be appointed. To be a success, the son of NFFC must be based on exceptional arrangements. If my hon. Friend the Minister of State regards the suggestion of a special shareholding as exceptional, I hope that he will realise that it is because we are dealing with an exceptional industry and an exceptional situation. We do not need to look at a run-of-the-mill arrangement for the industry. We need to look at the exceptional arrangement.<br><br>
Two amendments call for a wider shareholding, and an equality of shareholding. I am not sure whether they are probing or whether they are serious amendments. They depend upon the picture that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will paint of how he sees future development. In anticipation of his reply being satisfactory in all those respects, I await his contribution to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments that we are now debating have two main purposes. First, they say that the successor body to the NFFC ought to operate more clearly in the public interest than the clause now provides. Secondly the amendments seek to tighten the duties that are imposed upon the company to which the assets and income from the NFFC will be handed over and they seek to give some legal duty rather than merely the present enabling provisions of the clause.<br><br>
The amendments recommend several different formulae whereby those two major principles could be achieved. For example, amendment No. 11 mentions the need to instruct the successor company to invest rather than the present vague formula. The appointment of chief executive and his independence are mentioned, together with the commercial criteria the are now built into the new successor company, the wording on which should be tightened. Furthermore, amendments Nos. 36 and 40 try to give the Secretary of State a veto over the decisions that might be made by the new company.<br><br>
Several different mechanisms are being advanced in the amendments for achieving the objective of ensuring that the successor body with the assets that it has taken over acts in the public interest rather than on a purely commercial basis. There are several reasons why it is important for us to support the amendments, and the provisions and mechanisms that they suggest.<br><br>
The first reason derives mainly from what we have been told today, from what was in the White Paper and from what was said by the Government on Second Reading about the input of money and, therefore, the input of influence into the new company. We cannot get away from the fact that the new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
successor body will be dominated inevitably, by the major private interests that contribute to it. They, of course, are Thom EMI and Rank. The phenomenon is extremely worrying when public assets are being transferred, when the job of promoting British film is being handed over and when there will be a substantially dominating influence for the two companies which now control so much of the distribution of film products in this country.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
We must ask the Minister of State several questions so that our minds may be set at rest on exactly how the new company will operate and. exactly what the influence of those two major private commercial concerns will be. We must ask such questions as: What guarantee do we have that payments by those concerns will continue after the initial period envisaged in the White Paper? Secondly, what form of control, if any, have the companies sought to have over the new body in return for their commitment to put in money? Has a quid pro quo been promised by the Government, in the establishment of the new company, for the money which Thorn EMI and Rank put in? Have the Government offered preferential treatment in exchange for money contributed to the new company? Will a particular form of influence and decision-making power be available to the contributors of cash in return for their contribution? The Government need to be much more specific about the role which the contributors of money into the new company will perform. What guarantee will be given that their influence will be directed not purely at their own commercial interests but at the public interests which the new company is supposed to be protecting?<br><br>
We are worried that those two companies will dominate directly or indirectly, through the distributors to which they are linked through the system of alignments. The projects involving producers and directors already with them will attract support from those companies and from the new body. In other words, we are concerned that commercial criteria will dominate the decisions made by the new body. Thom EMI and Rank are not likely to be interested in the production of innovative and difficult films, which do not fit into the basic commercial marketable products, and commercial considerations will carry the day.<br><br>
I have been told that the dominance of Thorn EMI and Rank in the new body will a bit like putting Billy Bunter in charge of a cake shop. The passing over of public assets and the power to promote film to the new body should mean that the Government make a commitment on the exact role of the commercial sector in the new company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that he needs to ask another fundamental question? What sort of company are we talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, However, I am much more concerned about what the new company does, what powers it has and how it goes about its business of promoting film than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0456">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
about its precise structure. The two features inter-link strongly. My hon. Friend's question is important.<br><br>
The Government need to think again about the role of commercial private interests in the new company and in the promotion of film. Will private interests produce films that will be easy to market rather than those which are difficult and more challenging and which will take British film further forward rather than make it stick in a groove?<br><br>
There is a loose obligation on the new company to produce or encourage the production of films. The clause says that all that the new company has to do is
<br><blockquote><p>"use its best endeavours to encourage the production of relevant films ".</p></blockquote>
In our view that is not a sufficient duty to impose on the new company. A large piece of the inheritance of British film making since the war is being transferred to the new body and in return all that is being required to do is to use its best endeavours. The existing form of words gives little guarantee that there will be any promotion and production of film as a result of the creation of the new body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's, point gives me the opportunity to emphasise what I believe is wrong. As the subsection is drafted it imposes nothing on the company. The burden of satisfying the conditions laid down in the subsection rests on the Secretary of State, the company is entirely passive. It may say that it did not ask to be selected or that it did not guarantee to use its best endeavours; that was for the Secretary of State to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as ever, is right. It seems clear that as the wording stands it is inadequate. It does not provide for a certain and guaranteed mechanism for the promotion and production of film, nor for the encouragement of new, innovative talent.<br><br>
The clause as structured and the work of the contributors and those involved in the new body will not allow for some other sectors of film making, apart from the feature film industry. It is important that we do not assume automatically that the only part of the British film industry that is important and needs encouragement is the feature film industry. For example, we must be concerned about the making of education) and industrial films and, in particular—this is one of the most encouraging developments in the British film industry at present—about the workshop sector.<br><br>
At the moment workshops are grant-aided. The idea behind them is that they are not tied to a specific product of a film but area continuing operation and plough back profits from work that they do into future projects. They result from the workshops declaration, which is an agreement between the British Film Institute, Channel 4, the regional arts associations, the independent film and video association and the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians. Their work has been widened to include not only the production of film or video but the development of audiences research, educa
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
tion, and community work in the widest sense. There are 17 workshops at present that have been given a full or provisional franchise. They are spread around the country and have produced a substantial body of work, much of which has been for Channel 4.<br><br>
I raise the issue of the workshop sector simply to extract information on whether the Government envisage the successor body to NFFC providing support or encouragement for sectors such as the workshop sector in the film industry rather than just ploughing money into the production of feature films.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has touched on a very interesting part of the work done by the British Film Institute, of which I am a governor. However, he presumably recognises that, as with the theatre and other artistic pursuits in this country, a distinction is made between the parts whose activities are financed through the Office of Arts and Libraries, the sections which are dependent on the commercial market and the grey area which has a bit of both. Does the hon. Gentleman seriously suggest that all three should be lumped together under one organisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not trying to suggest that. I am, however, trying to establish the nature of the role of the new NFFC. Will it be wholly dominated by the production of films for commercial purposes in the form of feature films, or will it have a role in developing and promoting other sectors of film-making? I should like to know the Government's intentions.<br><br>
The Government are proposing an extremely peculiar creation—a substantially commercial enterprise in the form of a private company which, unless our amendments are accepted, will be dominated by private commercial interests, and yet will be charged with a loose responsibility for the promotion of British films. As it is now constituted, it seems to exist in a twilight zone somewhere between the area of public interest and that of private commercial gain. It is because the present definition is so worryingly loose that we have tabled amendments which seek to tighten up the provisions and the duties of the new body.<br><br>
Perhaps we should not be surprised. When we look at what the Government have said in many of their statements—when introducing the White Paper, and in subsequent debates—we see that the theme that they have been pushing all along is an attempt to set the industry free, to lift regulations, and to do away with quangos and other bodies that supposedly oppress producers of films and exhibitors of talent. In their mind, such a purpose is fully in line with their traditional philosophies.<br><br>
On Second Reading, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>" There is a clear choice, we have a commercial film industry. We can have it debilitated by subsidy, or we can have an industry which is dynamic and diverse."— [<i>Official Report,</i> 19 November 1984; Vol. 68, c. 107.]</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary may believe what he said then, or he may have suffered a slip
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0457">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
of the tongue in an unguarded moment. But the idea that the film industry can somehow be " debilitated by subsidy " is a novel one, and I hope that, on reconsideration, the Government will decide that perhaps they overstated their case. They could have made an argument about regulations, bureaucratic structures, quangos and administrative arrangements in general debilitating talent. We would not necessarily have agreed with them on all points. But to argue that subsidy somehow debilitates is difficult, even for the Government.<br><br>
When examining the successor body, we must ask the purpose behind it. Is it to impose duties of public interest to ensure that production and promotion of British film is encouraged? Is it to ensure the money from the Government from existing assets owned by the NFFC and from private commercial sources can be used independently in the public interest for the promotion of film and of filmmaking talent? Or, as I fear from the arrangements in the Bill, will there be a Government handout to a private company, with private and commercial interests dominant? Rather than putting money into promoting innovation and talent, will the Bill put money into the production of safe, easy, stale and dead films? Such films may make a bit of money for the distributors and a smaller amount for the makers, but they will not take British film and its production and innovation further forward.<br><br>
What are the Government about? At present I fear for the worst. I hope that the Government will be able to either accept our amendments or to say that they will tighten up the Bill's provisions.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Throughout the sitting we have been told about the precarious state of the industry, yet throughout his remarks the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) has referred to easy films. I should be interested to learn what those easy films are, and I am sure that many of those in the Public Gallery would also like to know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The easy film is best illustrated by the typical north American product, and not by what all members of the Committee regard as the best products of recent British film making. An extremely recent example of that is " The Killing Fields ", but then that is not an easy film or a typica lnorth American style of product, yet one hopes that it will be a commercial success. The British film industry has a wealth of similar talent and source ideas waiting to be tapped. But they will not necessarily be tapped by the Bill in its present form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to say that, throughout his speech, the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) has argued along the lines that the film industry is rather like a child suffering from malnutrition, although not on the Ethiopian scale? Nevertheless, the child is in need of careful guarding and parental care. We are not satisfied with the arrangement for its care and would like it to be made a ward of court for the time being.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As ever, the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) has expressed the matter more eloquently than I could. I hesitate to use the the word " felicitous " but the hon. Gentleman's example has hit the nail on the head, and has exhibited the two major faults of the successor body to the NFFC. One is inadequate funding and resources with which to promote the future of the film industry and the other, to use his analogy of ward of court, is that with private interests in charge we can have no guarantee, if I may continue with his analogy, of the continuing health and development of the child. We require an assurance from the Government on those two important points.<br><br>
It is important that we ensure that the successor body operates in the public interest and not in the interest of private concerns. The future of the British film industry may depend upon it. The Government must give us an assurance about the public role of this private company and the nature of that company's role before we can be fully satisfied about the future of a great industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley<span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the Bill, the Government are giving confidence to the film industry and wish to be seen to be doing so. They are not putting in as much money as many of us would like, but they should take their own words and those of the Minister on Second Reading and try to guarantee that that interest continues through thick and thin.<br><br>
The Government's commitment should be shown by the Minister in giving guarantees for the new NFFC. I think that the new body will be able to operate most efficiently and will encourage further investment in its new private structure. I believe that the structure of the son of NFFC, " NFFC rides again ", " NFFC II ", or whatever one likes to call it, is such that the various interests are reasonably well balanced. However, I remind the Committee that the original NFFC was set up to provide financing for those films which could not be financed on any purely commercial dictat from exactly those who will look after the new NFFC. Rank, Thom EMI and the British Viedogram Association are admirable bodies. Rank and Thorn EMI, especially Rank, were instrumental in the birth of British film making and we owe them a great debt. I do not deny that they are likely to support NFFC in the future. Channel 4 should be praised for its pioneering spirit in financing and encouraging the production of new films and new film makers. But those four organisations are commercial organisations and there will be great pressures upon them in an ever-different financial world.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister said, on Second Reading, that the thought that by being rooted in the private sector, the new company would bring a commercial edge to its operations. I should like to see such a commercial edge, but not commerce pure and simple. That is why I do not believe that the industry—the cinema film industry—could exist by being solely the slave of commerce.<br><br>
We cannot, as the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) said, see the articles and memorandum. We do not know what the objectives
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0458">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
will be and what assurances there will be for the existence of the new NFFC. I should prefer it if, within the reasonably well-balanced interests of the shareholdings proposed by my hon. Friend, there was a representative of independent film makers—someone representing views that are not purely commercial but nevertheless lean towards the commercial world for survival. I should prefer someone whose interests do not move quite so readily towards commercial gain or the commercial pressures present in the industry. I, therefore, seek guarantees from the Minister.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State gave guarantees on the transfer of the portfolio of existing rights, and I think that the Committee welcomed what my hon. Friend the Minister of State said earlier. However, it is the protection of independence from vested interests to balance the essential role of encouraging new film makers with that on an outright commercial concern that the Committee seeks today. I congratulate the Government on their general concept. But I believe that we should be given assurances that what the Government want, they will make sure continues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), I became more and more aware of the worry that I have about the clause as drafted. The outline is not there. In a Bill of this importance, one cannot rely simply on what the Government might do at some stage in the future. Both Ministers have said today that they have the interests of the film industry at heart. That is why I did not vote on the amendment. If we could hoist the Minister with his own petard—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry) that if one listens, perhaps one will learn.<br><br>
I am not as gullible as the Minister might think. If the Minister tells me in open Committee so that it is recorded in <i>Hansard</i> that he has the interests of the film industry at heart, I am prepared to accept it when the amendments are taken in the wrong sequence, as I see it. I would hold him to his statement, because on these amendments he will have to prove that he does have the interests of the industry at heart. If he does not hold it, we shall continue by arranging for amendments to be moved in another place or on Third Reading. We shall make his life miserable. I make no bones about it. I am quite good at drafting amendments. I shall draft them till the cows come home. It is crucial that we get the son of NFFC right. I am not content to leave it to the balance of the great and good four. Thorn EMI has substantial, if not overwhelming, American interests within it. Rank has given up making films. Channel 4 is doing a good job. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
join the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes in praising its efforts. However, of course, Channel 4 is making films for Channel 4. Our discussion is about the cinema industry. The last of the four is the video group. I know precious little about it at this stage. Moreover, at this stage, I must declare an open interest.<br><br>
As a lawyer, I looked at clause 3 and rubbed my hands with glee. It is a recipe for me to make money in the future. I can have litigation from here to eternity on it. To give one simple example, in clause 3(3) what is meant by the phrase, " a commercially successful basis "? I reckon that being briefed on that could earn me a fortune. Therefore, it must come out. We are not here to ensure that I have a big car in the future and can afford to buy everyone drinks all the time. The object of the Bill must not be to let the lawyers loose. I have said that on other Bills. The Government have failed to heed my advice, and I am already sitting back with a smirk on my face. Perhaps, this time, the Government can get it right. What is meant by the phrase? It is meaningless. Does it mean that El profit has to be made? Does it mean that X per cent. profit must be made? I have made that slight digression to give some idea of where I intend to go.<br><br>
The balance and structure of the company is crucial. The first fundamental argument is to be seen in the difference between amendment No. 11 and amendments Nos. 42 and 16. Is the company to be a public corporation? If so, certain matters have to be written in. On the other hand, if the route of amendments Nos. 42 and 16 was to be pursued, it would become a private company within the broadest meaning of the word " private ". So, how broad do the Government intend the meaning of the word " private " to be, or are they prepared to accept the concept of a public corporation?<br><br>
That is the first fundamental question. If the company is to be a public corporation, those represented within it must be much broader than the four. If it is to be a private company and it is to be successful, those represented within it must be much broader than the four.<br><br>
Earlier, I said that the memorandum and articles of association would be a fairly good start, because at least we would know how the company was to be structured. Clearly, we shall not see those documents. Therefore, perhaps we can build into it—</span></p>
