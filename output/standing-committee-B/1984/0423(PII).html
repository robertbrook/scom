	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about clause 33 because it gives a lot of money to the rich, who do not need it, at the expense of millions of citizens whose standards of living have been lowered by the Government's policies. At the last count there were 3,200,000 officially unemployed, although we all know that the real number's more than four million, because many people do not bother to register as unemployed and people who used to work full time but now work only part time are also not included on the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the gap that is opening up in our society. It worries Opposition Members and it should also worry real Conservatives in the House of Commons. There are not many real Conservatives in the House now but I hope that, although the number of Conservative Members will be fewer after the next election, a true Conservative party will then re-emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support entirely what my hon. Friends have said about the clause. It pushes up the higher rate bands and gives money away to those who do not need it. Examples have been given of the salaries of some captains of industry, but it has not been proved that if one gives more money away to those who do not need it, they will work harder because they realise that greater benefits are available. In fact, the reverse may be true. They may work less hard because they reason that to keep up their standard of living they do not have to work as hard since the higher rate tax bands and other giveaways make it unnecessary to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arguments could be advanced for having penal rates of taxation instead of giveaways to the rich so that they would all have to work harder if they wanted to maintain their standards of living. Conservative Members talk about initiatives and incentives, but if it were tougher at the top it would be an incentive to the rich to work harder to keep up their standards of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has not been proved one way or the other, but during the past four or five years of the Government's policies there has not been beneficent investment in manufacturing or record profits in our industries, nor are we seen to be leading the way as an industrialised nation. That shows that the Government's policies are wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to spend longer on the clause as time is getting on and we all want to get away, so I shall take only three or four minutes more. Besides their salaries, directors are entitled to share option schemes,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
which we dealt with in last year's Finance Bill. The Government thought that share option schemes would provide an incentive for employees to partake in the ownership of their companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can now see the first results of share option schemes. My list of share option schemes shows that the salary of John Harvey-Jones, chairman of ICI, whose salary is £170,000 a year, had a notional share option gain of £486,950 at 24 January 1985. I know that he cannot necessarily realise that gain now, but if that is his notional share option gain, it makes his salary pale into insignificance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of Trafalgar House, has a salary of £105,000, and his notional share option gain, at the same date, was £423,342. Dick Giordano has a salary of £771,600—an increase of 48 per cent—over the previous year—and his share option notional gain was 080,000. I would not say that Mr Giordano could do without his salary, because his share option gain is less than the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have six further figures, and I shall not give them all to the Committee. Brian Smith, another ICI director, whose salary is somewhere between £110,000 and £170,000, has a share option gain of £326,860. A huge gain of £2,881,664 has been made by John Beckett, chairman of Woolworth Holdings. He cannot cash his shares yet—only when the price is right—but even if the price is not right, he will still have made quite a large gain. Why do companies bother to pay their chairmen salaries when they can cash in their options and live on the proceeds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that some Conservative Members would be worried by such goings on. In the light of those figures, I do not think that the Government can say that they have a progressive tax system. The DHSS has been helping the Government with their usual policy of taking away from the poor. I shall not give a long detailed list of measures, but shall start by mentioning the break in the link between the rise in a pensioner's income and the rise in average earnings and the rise in inflation. That was the beginning of a long process whereby the needy in society have been done down by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other end of the scale we have a long list of measures giving to the rich, who do not want the money. I shall not go through that list, either, except to recount the first thing that the Government did which was to knock down from 83 per cent to 60 per cent the rate of tax paid on the top band of earned income. My second list culminates in last year's measures in favour of share option schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, even more higher rate bands are upgraded. That really annoys me. This may not be the time to bring up the subject, but it is symptomatic of the way that the Government are seeking to divide the country and have divided the country. They will rue the day that they began to follow such policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise, briefly, to express my strong support for the clause, and the measures it contains, coupled with those on national insurance contributions in the Social Security Bill, represent a considerable relief for taxpayers at all levels, and particularly for low-income earners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall never be totally satisfied with the extent to which we can relieve the burden of personal income tax, but the clause is a step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) clarified the Opposition's position on the definition of rich people. I am advised that the Daily Express article on which I relied was wrong in suggesting that the right honourable Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) intended to include household incomes of more than £20,000 in his definition of rich. I gladly acknowledged that I was misled by the 	<i>Daily Express.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my remarks to the Committee will not receive the wide attention of a feature article in the Daily Express, although I should be happy if they did. No doubt the right honourable Member for Spark-brook will take steps to correct the impression given to readers in the article if they have no chance to study my remarks. I am delighted that this point is receiving so much attention. The right honourable Gentleman's views on income tax deserve the widest publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can rely on the article in Tribune. Although that publication may not be an accurate guide to the Labour party's views, I imagine that the views attributed to the right honourable Member for Sparkbrook are his own. I see that an interview was conducted with Adrian Hamm who was a contemporary of mine at Cambridge. He seems to have forgotten nothing and learnt nothing since then. Doubtless Opposition Members will correct me if I am wrong, but in the article the right honourable Member refers to the top 15 per cent who earn £20,000 a year. I am not surprised that there has been confusion about this. The figures that I have looked at briefly suggest that the average of the top 15 per cent income earners would take us down to a level well below £20,000. However, I shall let that pass. I have no doubt that my constituents, some of whom earn more than £20,000 a year, would be very interested to learn of the prospects of much higher tax rates in the future, particularly if they knew the purpose to which the revenue would be put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further on in the same article by the right honourable Member for Sparkbrook, I find that he proposes to renationalise British Telecom, no doubt at considerable cost to the taxpayer. It seems an extraordinary use of taxpayers' money to buy BT back from the hundreds of thousands of individuals who have become share owners for the first time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member goes too far down that path, I must tell him that it would be out of order to consider the manner in which hypothetical sums might be spent. We must refer to the tax rates before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Miss Fookes, for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that if the Opposition had an opportunity to introduce much higher tax rates, they would enjoy the full support of the Liberal party which, during the period of the Lib-Lab pact, took no steps to end the 98 per cent confiscatory rates of income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) criticised the failure of tax cuts to create new jobs. That is an arguable point, but I believe--and I think that it is generally agreed—that they are at least more likely than tax increases to create jobs. Because of the concern that all Conservative Members have about the need to create jobs, we welcome the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak only briefly, because my hon. Friends have already made the case very well against these taxation proposals. It is regrettable that the lower-paid sections of the community are still more heavily taxed than other sections. I should like the emphasis to be switched back to the higher paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only those earning more than £19,000 benefit from the tax changes made by the Conservative Government since they came to power in 1979. Their first Budget reduced the standard rate of tax by 3p and the top rate on earned income by 23p. That was a bad move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only aspect of the clause that I welcome is that any tax reductions have been used in the right way. I should not have wanted a reduction in taxation rates because that would also benefit the higher paid. It was right to increase allowances and to leave taxation rates at the same level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few of my constituents have incomes of more than £19,000 or £20,000 and benefit from the overall changes in taxation resulting from Government policy. In addition to direct taxation there has been a switch to indirect taxation, which penalises the more lowly paid, as do increases in national insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in the House this afternoon I asked the result of reducing taxation from 30 to 15 per cent on the first £1,000 of taxable income. Hon. Members may find the answer derisory, but it showed what the result would be. The fact that it would mean 100 per cent taxation for those with more than £20,000 taxable income showed how few people benefited from the tax relief under that bracket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we say that that income is earned, I find it difficult to judge how someone earns the high figures that have been mentioned. When I worked in a factory, the lowest-paid unit—the packers—could bring the factory to a standstill more quickly than any other if its workers were not present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing that a manager's job is unimportant, but sometimes it is difficult to compare jobs and to decide how important someone's work is. I accept that those with responsibilities should get higher pay but I find it difficult to justify someone earning £170,000 or £120,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since 1979, personal tax allowances have been increased by 20 per cent in real terms. By how much were they increased under the previous Labour Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not relevant. The amount of money given to taxpayers by those increases could have been used in a fairer and better way. I am not saying that the Government need not have reduced the top rate of 83 per cent. I should have been happy if they had knocked it down to 80 or 75 per cent. But in all honesty I do not know how one can justify the reduction to 60 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who work long hours in difficult conditions are now worse off because of the Government's financial policy. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) to say that those earning £20,000 or more would be worried about the Labour party's proposals. They form a small percentage of the population. The hon. Gentleman is saying that to please
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
a small percentage of the population—the wealthy who already have money—it is all right to upset most of the workers and ordinary people in the country. That is the issue at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should raise the allowances further. I still believe that there should be a lower tax band for the bottom rate. I accept the difficulty in the answer given this afternoon, but the question was a probing one—[Interruption.] Hon. Members may laugh, but it is a serious matter. Once someone starts to pay tax and pays that 30 per cent straightaway, he is heavily penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The person on £20,000 would at least benefit by the £2.88 a week allowance on the first £1,000 of his income. He may feel aggrieved at having to pay a bit more, but he would pay a lot more with one hand and get a little back with the other. It would certainly benefit many more people in this country and increase the spending power of more ordinary people. If the figure of £2.88 a week were given back to the ordinary people, they would be far more likely to spend it than people who are already earning £20,000, £170,000 or whatever because they must find it difficult to spend what they earn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) referred to a birthday party mentioned in the newspaper. I assure the Committee that he does not have an invitation to go to one of those parties, following some of his comments. That illustrates how some people want to spend their money. Some people will find it hard to see that sort of money spent on a party when they find is difficult to find money to meet their budgets for good food, clothing and other necessities of life. We should be considering how to provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals may not have reduced the taxation rate. They have given the money in allowances, which is certainly the better procedure. However, we could have had a better package which would have benefited more ordinary people. I make no apology for saying that I would be prepared to vote for an increase in the top rate of taxation. That may upset some of my electors. However, even though I have a majority o only 770, I am sure that by putting extra taxation on the people paying the top rate, I shall not affect my majority at the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should look more at giving benefit. While the Government may not be prepared to make changes now, they should aim at giving more to the lower paid in the next Budget, remembering, that some people, such as the unemployed, are not fortunate enough to be paying tax. It is no good the Government saying that they are helping the lower paid, as they are not benefiting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I woke up this morning, a sudden thrill went through me. I suspected that today would be a day of revelation and explanation. I thought that I would be much better informed at the end of the day than I was at the beginning. I rushed to the Vote Office and searched for the amendment paper and thumbed through to the amendments to clause 33, because I thought that there might be an explanation of Labour policy. However, there was none. I thought that, if I rose to make a point of order, I could ask whether a manuscript amendment had been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I knew that you, Miss Fookes, had ruled that out of order. I listened to the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald), and she did not move an amendment to the clause. Therefore, I am none the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
wiser. I do not know whether it is Labour party policy to have rates of 100 per cent, as the hon. Member for Burnley would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in my own time, as the hon. Lady did to me. I do not know whether it is Labour party policy to have rates of 98 per cent. Perhaps Mr Neuberger has not managed to get the numbers through his computer yet. Or perhaps the right honourable Member for Birmingham, Spark-brook (Mr. Hattersley) is still discussing the little local difficulty with the hon. Member for Oldham. West (Mr. Meacher). Perhaps the truth is that the Labour party is in a blue funk and its members are so terrified about the rates of tax that they would have to introduce to meet their spending plans that they dare not table an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at the hon. Gentleman. He has been a member of more than one Finance Bill Committee, but he still does not understand the rules of procedure. The Opposition cannot amend a clause in such a way as to increase the burden of taxation on any individual or group of individuals. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has not learnt the basic rule of procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to give way to the hon. Lady, but as she has decided not to table an amendment, perhaps she can meet my difficulty by now telling me what she would have done, had she been able to table the amendment that she wished to table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Undoubtedly that would be out of order and therefore frowned on by the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, at least I am reassured on behalf of some of the 100 people whom the hon. Lady said that she would attack personally. Should she vote against the clause, she will get their undying support, because she will be voting for them to pay no income tax at all. She will be voting directly to assist the people who are best off. I assume, therefore, that the Labour party does not seriously argue against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) wishes to know the Labour party's policy on this clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) made it quite clear, we oppose it root and branch. When we come to office, as we undoubtedly shall in two years' time, we shall table a clause in our first Finance Bill to make only too clear our policy towards people in the higher rate bands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has given an assurance about what his party will do in its first Finance Bill, will he also give us an assurance that he will actually tell the public what his party intends to do if it ever comes to office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to contain his anxiety to know our plans for his no doubt substantial income. Let him enjoy it while he can, because things will be very different in two years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that this clause has at last flushed out the hon. Member for Enfield, North. He has been uncharacteristically reticent on this Bill. Those of us
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
who remember him last year will recall many smiles and good-humoured sallies from him, but not many speeches. At least our conduct on this clause has got him to his feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now, of course, we have been in the foothills of this Finance Bill. Indirect taxation is all very well, with Customs and Excise and VAT, and other crucial issues such as assessment of records and information, but now that we have come to direct taxation we reach the higher summits of the Bill, and the real political work begins. We look forward to an increased contribution from the Financial Secretary. It is only when we get to direct taxes that we begin to see a Government's political priorities. Certainly the political priorities of this Government and this Chancellor are all too apparent, and my hon. Friends have made very clear their priorities about the redistribution of wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer to take a different quotation from a well-known politician, and I shall willingly give wayto any Conservative Member who can tell me its source. Those who are anxious to proceed quickly will no doubt spring to their feet to tell me who said last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The poor pay far too much tax."</p></blockquote>
I shall be interested to find out who knows—apart from the chief Secretary perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help the Committee in this little quiz if my hon. Friends repeated the words in the appropriate accent and with the appropriate emphasis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not possibly manage that; I am an appalling mimic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure Conservative Members are too modest to divulge, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on 30 January. His solution to the correct observation that the poor pay far too much tax is revealed in the clause. His solution is to help the rich to pay less tax and to deepen inequality in our society.

My hon. Friends have made a very good case in arguing that inequality has increased under the Government. The hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo) made what he thought was an effective point about those on £20,000 a year. I should point out to him that anyone earning more than £20,000 under this Government is paying a great deal less tax. Personal taxation revenue has increased by almost £10 billion under this Government, but those who earn £20,000 and above are paying less tax. Similarly, taxation on the higher rate bands is now on average only 75 per cent of what it was in 1979–80.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Yeo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the sources of great rejoicing under this Government is that many more people are earning £20,000 a year. Indeed, the right honourable Member for Birmingham, Sparbrook (Mr. Hattersley) claims in his article that 15 per cent are earning more than £20,000. That is more than half the number of people who voted for the Labour party at the last election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is having great fun with his statistics. But he should stand back a little from the picture and see that the people in the higher rate bands constitute just 3 per cent of taxpayers. It is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
the richest 3 per cent of earning taxpayers who are affected by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those people have benefited under this Government—as they assuredly have because the Conservative party is true to its friends—the number of people in poverty has increased from 11 million to 15 million. I am sure that the hon. Member for Suffolk, South, with his interest in charitable works, recognises that. The hon. Gentleman knows the definition of poverty as well as anyone else on the Committee. The generally accepted definition is supplementary benefit plus 40 per cent. The number of people with that level of income or below has increased under this Government from 11 million to 15 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sign of this Government's political priorities. That is what the clause is all about—more money to those who have it and a slide into poverty for four million more people. Conservative Members cannot be proud of that. They must know that many of their constituents fall into the poverty trap. If they can look those people in the eye in their surgeries this weekend and over the holiday and say, "We have let you slip into poverty, but we have also helped, and continue to help in the Finance Bill Committee, those on higher incomes," I can only say that they must have a very steady eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to hear from the Chief Secretary how he can possibly justify the clauses. What reasons—social, political or economic—can the Committee expect for his assisting these people in this way? I am sure that he would not argue that there is enormous financial need among these people. He is an honest and straightforward man after his own fashion, and I am sure that he would not say that the people in the higher rate bands whom he helps are in need of the extra money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have made much play of the article in The Sunday Times which revealed that there are 100 top executives earning more than £98,000 a year. In case Conservative Members have difficulty conceiving what £98,000 is, it is more than a person on supplementary benefit would receive in income for his entire lifetime, but those executives receive it in one year. I am sure that they work hard and are talented men. It is interesting that no women are included. No doubt those men do a good job for the country or for their shareholders—guiding the fortunes of the companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can any Conservative Member seriously say that he wants to live in a society where someone earns for his endeavours in one year more than another man of equal worth can earn in a whole lifetime on supplementary benefit? I am sure that the Chief Secretary will not claim that there is a financial need for them to earn more. How can anyone spend or need more than £98,000 a year, much less the fantasy figure at the top of the scale of £772,000? I am sure that someone is extremely grateful for the odd £2,000. It is absurd to give those sums to people without financial need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Chief Secretary argue that it increases the efficiency of those men or their companies? I am sure that he can not. Does he say that it is an incentive? Interestingly enough, the article mentions incentive. To be fair, Mr. Beresford and Mr. Gareth Hugh Davis talk about the relationship between these increases and the increases in profitability of their companies, and there is an interesting correlation. But surely that is not why the companies' profitability has increased. It

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
cannot be because their chief executives felt that if that happened, they would receive a similar increase in salaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be said that Mr. Michael Ashcroft has had a salary rise from £106,000 to £199,000 from the Hawley Group, whose profits went up by 2,1 per cent while his salary went up by 114 per cent. There is an interesting correlation there. I wonder whether others working for the Hawley Group were lucky enough to receive £114,000. Was the Hawley Group's success attributed solely to Mr. Michael Ashcroft., or did not other workers contribute something to its success last year? I am sure that Conservative Members, with their well-known families, think that if one worker gets an increase commensurate with the profitability of the company, why not everyone?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine that Mr. Michael Ashcroft's satisfaction at seeing the Hawley Group succeed is related to the salary that he receives. I do not believe that either incentive or efficiency are the reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Chancellor sees this as a way of reforming taxation. He has always told us that he is keen to do so. Is this what he means? Can the Chief Secretary enlighten us whether this is the type of reform that the Chancellor wishes to make, and of which we will see more?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is its purpose? I am anxious for the Chief Secretary's reply, so I shall sit down. Perhaps he can answer a couple of other factual questions when he replies. I hope that he will address his mind to the political and economic reasons behind the clause. Will he tell us what is the income from the higher rate bands, how much revenue will be lost by raising the bands and how many individuals will benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist) asked the Financial Secretary in a written question yesterday how many people earned between £50,000 and £99,000. The Financial Secretary undertook to let him have an answer It would have assisted the Committee if we had had that information today. Perhaps the Chief Secretary will at least give us some idea of how many people were in each of those bands in the last available Treasury statistics. Whatever his answer, it will reveal that there is a huge political gulf between the Government and the Opposition. Labour Members cannot look at their constituencies without seeing the enormous inequalities of reasources and income in our society. In politics, one wishes either to see those inequalities reduced or expanded. The Government may say that they believe that in expanding inequalities they make a sharper and more competitive edge to society and give people a greater incentive to strive. There is not much incentive for people to strive under this Government. The inequalities are so manifest and the injustices so widespread that many people in our constituencies despair of making a success of their lives or of ever being allowed to do so under this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that inequalities are morally, politically and economically indefensible. They do not make sense. The clause widens inequalities and we oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall intervene briefly, because I do not wish to rehearse all of my hon. Friend's arguments. This is the seventh year in which I have sat on the Finance Bill Committee. I have noticed that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
every year in this debate, the Chief Secretary, or whoever is responsible for replying for the Government, invariably adopts the same approach: that of boredom. The Minister cannot wait for the end of the debates. He shows a desperate desire to get on to the next clause and an utter indifference to the contributions that are made by my hon. Friends. That happens year after year. If the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) were allowed to speak, he would say, as I do, that we are wasting our time; but there are those outside the House who expect us to put this case and that is why we persist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, the Chief Secretary's role in winding up the debate is different. He is no longer in what some might refer to as a safe Tory seat. He is in a Labour marginal, and the burghers of Dover and Deal will be very interested in his views on reducing or increasing the tax burden on the higher paid in society. I do not wish to argue an old case. I wish to ask the Chief Secretary a simple question. If he is unwilling to accept that there is any unfairness in these matters and if he refuses to accept the Socialist argument that there is a duty on Government to ensure fair play and decency in tax legislation, does he not accept that he has a duty to tell the Committee to what extent the reduction of taxation over the last few years has added to incentives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What evidence is there that business men are responding in the way that he suggests or that Mr. Giordano works one second longer or performs one moment's more work in a day when his salary is increased by so many tens of thousands of pounds per annum? I understand that his increase this year was about 48 per cent more than in 1983. Is Mr. Giordano working harder for the additional £350,000 that he is earning in the current year? If he is not, surely there can be no possible justification for the Government to reduce the tax burden that falls on him. Indeed, is there not a case for increasing his tax burden if he is not working harder and the argument is all about incentives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the salaries awarded to those highly-paid people and set out to evaluate whether reducing the tax on their incomes has in any way added to their efficiency—and it can be shown that it has not—surely it must be said that to reduce taxes in the way that the Government have done in the past few years is simply to give away money. In 1981, the then Chief Secretary kept using the words, "We need the money.", and hon. Members will remember that series of Budget debates. The point is that the Government still need the money and it is available. It is being given away and, in my view, it is not creating conditions for further incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely want to hear what evidence the Chief Secretary has because the country is entitled to know. It is not sufficient for him to say, "It is our view that business men work harder because they gain an extra £5,000 or £10,000 per annum."—he must be able to quantify the additional effort that they put in. If he cannot do so, surely it is quite wrong for the Government to persist in the current tax regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To add to the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald), I firmly believe that taxes on the higher paid in society should be increased substantially. I see nothing wrong in saying that, and the general public expect us to say it because they know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
that there have been substantial reductions in the tax paid by the better off. They expect us to reverse that tax regime, and I am sure that my hon. Friends will be eager to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get out of order, Miss Fookes, by saying that we should oppose the clause standing part, as I did on the previous clause. I do not want to oppose it for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Eggar), who is present tonight to compensate for his failure to make progress in the Government by making a noise in the Finance Bill Committee for a change. However, we can express our doubts, reservations and, indeed, hostility to the raising of the tax thresholds for the higher paid an put the argument that the rates on them are lower than they should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said, in 1979 the nub of the Government's intellectual argument, which was not an intellectual argument at all, was that they would regenerate the economy of the country by incentives. It was fascinating to hear the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo)—who, of course, is not now present—say that the proposition that tax cuts provided incentives was arguable. Therefore, what was gospel in 1979 is an arguable proposition in 1985. It is far less than that, but it was certainly central to the Government's published position and intellectual argument in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to cite some quotations because they are the basis of the proposals in the clause. On 19 April 197 the Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Conservations are going to put that incentive back. We are going to do it by cutting tax, by ensuring bigger rewards for skill for success, for responsibility. We are going to do it by making it pay to work again".</p></blockquote>
The Conservatives have created a society in which people will pay to work again because they are unemployed. The Prime Minister said that Conservatives would make it pay to work again by seeing that those who put their backs into their jobs received good wages and fewer tax deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man who subsequently became Chancellor and is now Foreign Secretary said in the same month, April 1979:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are pledged to reduce income tax across the board for the poor as well as the rich".</p></blockquote>
The Conservatives would cut the tax on work; incentives were central to their strategy and would be the means of regeneration. It was easy; all the Conservatives had to do was reduce tax, particularly for the higher paid, and there would be a surge of initiative and enterprise and a new boost to the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now five to six years into that experiment. What has been the result of the Government's strategy, based on that philosophy? Has there been a boom in the economy that we were led to expect would result directly from that easy strategy—which concealed the selfishness involved by being dressed up in economic terms as being good for the country and not just for those receiving the tax cuts? Certainly, they have felt the benefit, but the benefit for the country has been nil. Indeed, the justification for reducing the higher rates of tax and increasing the thresholds is shown to be false.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said by the present Foreign Secretary that those in tax exile would flood back here, but how many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
have? Perhaps the Minister will tell us that.— [Interruption.] Again, it was argued that cutting tax would mean that people would be prepared to be paid in salary and not in perks and by way of other dodges. Has that happened, or has there been an increase in such things as share option schemes?—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that sometimes it is tempting to make seated interventions, but when they interfere with a Member's speech I must ask that they stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that, Miss Fookes. As I was saying, the tax cuts were supposed to ensure that people took their rewards through salaries rather than by way of perks such as share options. But I suspect that there has been no reduction in tax dodges. Indeed, share options are becoming a scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear in mind the enormous number of option schemes enjoyed by many executives of major companies. Perhaps the classic example is that of John Beckett, chairman of Woolworth Holdings, whose options—which were granted when he came in to rescue the company—were worth £2,800,000 at the beginning of this month. He was allowed to buy the shares at £1.50 each and the price in early May was £8.15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary to the Treasury found it necessary to tell the Institute of Directors that such schemes should be not just for its members but for other people in their companies—the workers and others lower down the hierarchy. The hon. Gentleman nobly reminded those executives that the options should not be hogged by managing directors, and so on, but should be thrown open to everybody. More important, the promised regeneration has not come. Si monumentum requiris, circumspice, indeed, as we look at the wreckage of the economy—and at the wreckage in the Cabinet, consisting not so much of extinct volcanoes but of squeezed pimples. The monument to those false predictions is all around us in the state of the British economy. It could be argued that the clamour for tax cuts particularly from highly paid people in industry, has meant that they espouse foolishly the monetarist doctrines which became not only a rod for their own backs but an instrument of their own ruin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They took those tax cuts, paid lip service, and the CBI never attacked or criticised the Government, but praised monetarism for the first two or three years. The CBI did so because it was a means of getting tax cuts for its members. It did not see the harm that that would inflict on the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That monetarist policy has not worked out as it was supposed to have done. It has created a society in which money has been transferred to the better-off and harmed the poor, on whom the burden of sacrifice necessary for depression—the burden of unemployment and increased taxation to finance the cuts—has been placed. I shall not go on because the figures have been quoted before. The low pay unit has provided fascinating figures to show that those on average pay, slightly above average pay and below average pay are paying more taxes than they were in 1978–79. It is right that we should protest as a party which believes in a fairer and more equal society, a fairer distribution of rewards, a better society. That is a better way of bringing people together. We should protest about what is going on and the effect it is having on the economy and the highly paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to protest. Does he recall that in previous years when the hon. Members for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) and Brimingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Beaumont-Dark) were on the Committee at least they spiritedly defended the Government's position on the issue? They set out to try to justify the tax regimes but, since the Finance Bill Committee has been littered with Thatcher clones, we have never had a decent debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think hon. Members know that I deplore rather personal references. By all means attack policies but not people. I hope that we can keep off that particular tack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the correction. I would not want to make a personal attack, but the argument is not being put, not for any reasons of intellectual incompetence but because the Government's policy has exploded; it is a myth. Everyone now recognises that the policy put forward by the Government in 1979 as the principal means of regenerating the economy has exploded, been discredited and has had no effect. It will be interesting to hear when the Minister replies, what benefits have been achieved by the tax cuts given to the better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take the top 100 league of directors and the money that has been put into their pockets, we see a rather sad and sorry position if we look at the contribution they have made to the British economy over the last year. Datastream International Limited estimates that the 100 highest paid executives had an average pay increase last year of £30,000. The average salary of those people is now £156,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the companies represented by those men we do not see great companies leading a surge to exports to make the country more competitive to win back our share of world markets which has declined since the war. We do not see those companies massively displacing imports on our markets. We see companies like Saatchi and Saatchi, whose pretax profits go up as the country goes down because, presumably, that is the deal they have concluded with the Conservative party which they advertise so effectively. We also see a whole range of companies in consumer goods, retail distribution, selling cars to the consumer and money manipulation. We do not see the big exporting companies. There are some but they are in the minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A typical example is Mr. Michael Ashcroft of the Hawley Group who has been given—or has perhaps given himself—a rise of £106,000. When the Hawley Group took over companies in financial difficulties, like Coldshield and Wallguard, the people who bought their double glazing and damp coursing from those companies had guarantees from them that the work would be made good if it was faulty for ten or 20 years, which is quite a long time. When the Hawley group took over the companies, it was announced that there was no money to maintain the guarantees, but the money is there to give its head a rise of £106,000 a year. That is the sort of initiative which has been rewarded and the sort of incentive which has been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving towards a society in which the gaps are growing wider, not narrower as they should be. The Government shower benefits on the better off and privileged sections of the community and impose burdens on the poor, the unemployed and the old, who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
are the least equipped and least able to carry them. No Opposition Member can support such a society. The Opposition will reverse the evolution towards it when we achieve power. The country itself does not want such a society. The spectacle of greedy people shovelling money into their pockets, assisted by this incompetent Government on the basis of an exploded philosophy, is indecent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support clause 33 because I think that it is right that, in 1985-86, income tax should be charged at the basic rate of 30 per cent. It was suggested before the Budget that the standard rate of income tax should be reduced, but I thought that my right honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was right to keep it at 30 per cent and to use the available resources to increase personal allowances by more than the rate of inflation—they were increased by 10 per cent. I also support the allowance of £16,200, because it is an increase of 5.2 per cent on last year's comparable figure. I also think it was right to increase the higher rate bands by about 5 per cent. The lion's share of resources in the Budget went to the low-paid, which I support. It is the main reason why I support the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the speeches from the Opposition in this debate have been complaints not about this year's Budget but about the 1979 Budget, in which the balance was altered to end the confiscatory rates of taxation for the higher paid. It was not really an incentive for the higher paid, although that was an important argument. The most important argument was that a rate of 98 per cent on unearned income and 83 per cent on earned income was a confiscatory rate which was completely unjustifiable and unacceptable in comparable terms, because there was no comparable rate in any competitor country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incentives are much more important for the low-paid. As I said when I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike), the thresholds have been increased by 20 per cent in real terms since 1979. That is a major achievement. Of course, there is much further to go in that respect. We can help people, and it does matter to them. Millions of people are involved, not just the very small number on which the Opposition have concentrated in the debate. We are concerned about the millions of people on low incomes who still pay income tax, and we must press the Government to continue fighting to cut their tax and to increase the thresholds for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not underestimate the Government's achievements. Average earnings have risen substantially. Anybody who has average earnings enjoys more real take-home pay than he has ever had before, which is also a major achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition naturally talk about the percentage tax paid by people with average earnings. We must rectify the argument by repeating that today, average earnings are higher and that people enjoy more real take-home pay. That is important and is the reason why we should support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friends when they said that the Conservatives were creating an increasingly unjust and unequal society.

That policy is very much embodied in the tax rates proposed in the Bill. The tax rates are obscenely generous to the rich. The Budget benefits the greedy rather than the needy in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the Government's motivation behind the tax rates. It is all about incentives. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) quoted Mrs Thatcher's speech in Birmingham when she said that she would encourage incentives by cutting tax. My hon. Friend could have quoted other Conservative Members. For instance, he could have quoted Sir Geoffrey Howe when he said that the next Conservative Government would cut—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not usual to refer to another hon. Member by name rather than by constituency or title of office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Miss Fookes. I am not very well up with the etiquette. I have been in the Chamber listening attentively to the debate which will affect my constituents. The ex-Chancellor said in April 1979 that the next Conservative Government would:
	<br><blockquote><p>"cut and cut substantially the basic and higher rates of income tax."</p></blockquote>
He said that a Conservative Government would:
	<br><blockquote><p>"raise and raise substantially the level at which people start paying tax."</p></blockquote>
He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have absolutely no intention of doubling VAT."</p></blockquote>
All his claims were false. He did not double VAT. It was raised from 8 per cent to 15 per cent—an increase of seven-eighths. The ex-Chancellor was only partly right. He was only partly right when the he said that Government would
	<br><blockquote><p>"cut and cut substantially the basic and higher rates of income tax."</p></blockquote>
However, his statement was patently false when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall raise and raise substantially the level at which people start paying income tax."</p></blockquote>
Where is the incentive that the Government talk about? They have given £12.9 billion since 1979 to the rich. Is that not enough? Why do the Government need to keep increasing that amount year by year? Some of us believe that they have given more than enough. How much more will they give? I should like the Chief Secretary to explain the difference between an incentive and a handout. If money is given to the pensioners, it is a handout. If it is given to a voluntary group or the poor by way of a small subsidy, it is a handout. If it is given to the rich, it is an incentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said that he wanted to give incentives to those on low pay. They already have an incentive under this Government to survive. Their incomes have been cut time and time again. The Government begrudge giving handouts, yet they believe that it is all right to put aside £75 million to bail out Johnson Matthey. The Government see that as an incentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where has it led? It has led to massive industrial devastation. Two million more people are now on the dole. There are high interest rates, business bankruptcies and 6.9 per cent inflation. At Question time, I heard the Prime Minister scoff and compare that figure with the figures under previous Governments. But that is not a fair comparison. The comparison should be made with the rate of inflation in other industrial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
nations in the western world. The average in those countries is 4 per cent. At 7 per cent, this country is 75 per cent less competitive than they are. On that criterion, when have a Labour Government caused the country to be less competitive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have squandered our national resources. Despite record revenue from North sea oil, there has been less investment. Captains of industry have been given incentives. The chairman of ICI had an increase in salary of 68 per cent to £287,000 a year and others have had similar increases. But, the British people have not benefited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another traditional economic argument comes directly from the economic text books. When money is given to the rich there is less propensity for them to buy British goods, whereas money given to lower-paid working people will usually be spent by them on British goods. Working people have a higher propensity for buying British goods to get our economy going. So that incentive has not done much for British industry, nor for businesses generally, as there have been up to 26 bankruptcies a day since the Conservative Government took office. There have been 26,000 bankruptcies since that day. Lord Thorneycroft, when he was chairman of the Conservative party, said of Lord Vestey, who had paid no taxes despite making a profit of millions of pounds, "Good luck to anyone who can make a success of business". I echo his words. Good luck to anyone who can make a success of business under the Tory Government's policy that has led to record bankruptcies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the incentive for the building industry? Two building industry employers in my constituency have written to me. They want incentives to get their building work going and they complain about the Government's policy. Such people can have high pay and pay low tax on it, but it will not make any difference when they try to get their firms going.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Miss Fookes, I take that point. Fortunately, I had not intended to speak on the general issues as I spoke about them on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax rates—the subject of the clause—are supposed to provide the incentive to get the country going, but instead there has been devastation. Money has gone into the pockets of the rich, but there has been no incentive for most British people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my speech. I am in favour of much greater equality of income and wealth as well as of opportunities of power. Equality should be reflected in the tax rates set out in the clause, but it is not. The top rates of tax should be increased substantially and the burden of taxation shifted to the rich. I am in favour of soaking the rich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At that rather appropriate moment—not that I have any claim to be rich—I rise to intervene to produce a fair balance in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a vintage debate with speeches on egalitarianism of a kind that I would have found a little out of date had I heard them when I was first privileged
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

to sit in the Finance Committee in 1970. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) accused Conservative Front Bench spokesmen, and me in particular, of showing indifference. I am deeply apologetic if I seem not to have followed the speeches as closely as I should, but I assure the Committee that I have. I have heard various versions of them over the past 15 or 16 years, but I live in hope that one day there will be a flash of enlightenment on the Opposition Benches and a new form of speech—a new perception of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald). I was living in hope during the hon. Lady's speech, interesting though it was., because I had the privilege today of reading a very agreeable article in The Listener in which the hon. Lady drew some conclusions, which are entirely relevant to the debate, on the need for incentives in Chinese society and the disadvantages of a rigid egalitarian society. The hon. Lady nods, which means that I am citing her correctly. It seems that all the lessons that she learnt on her recent visit to China are not to be applied by her as a Labour spokesman in our debates on direct taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are talking about flashes of enlightenment, has my right honourable and learned Friend noticed that in the interview, Tribune the right honourable Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) has begun to recognise that the wealth tax is not the crock of gold that Labour used to think it was?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question we are discussing today, is my right honourable and learned Friend aware that if the Labour party were to double the rate of tax in excess of basic rate for incomes over £20,000, which is perhaps a construction that could be put upon what the hon. Lady has said, the yield would be only £1,700 million, or about 5 per cent of total income tax revenue? Perhaps it could be said that Opposition Members have begun to recognise that there is no pot of gold in the wealth tax and they should recognise the need to overcome the same illusions about income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made some perceptive comments. His facts are at least accurate. I have no doubt that some have been fortified by the answers given by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who has been asked questions on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the same theme runs through the contributions of many hon. Members on both sides of the House who have served in the Treasury. I recall an intervention made by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1969, who was able to give the figure that would have been yielded had all incomes over a certain figure been confiscated. The figure then was something like £15,000 a year; the sums were derisory and would not have been capable of financing the projects that the Labour party has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most contributions made by Opposition Members have fastened at the top end of the higher rate bands. I assume that those comments are entirely within order, Miss Fookes, as we are debating the higher rate bands, which stretch from £16,200 per annum to £40,200 per annum. Some of our fellow countrymen who may be rash enough to listen to our debates, which I believe are being broadcast, will be rather surprised to hear themselves described, if their incomes are about £16,200
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
a year, as the greedy plutocrats whom Opposition Members have pilloried in their contributions. I do not say that the hon. Member for Thurrock has done that—perhaps she was more circumspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify this point. The Chief Secretary is fully aware that £16,200 refers to taxable income and not to gross earnings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. I am always glad to be reminded of it by the hon. Lady, but such people would be a little startled by some of the strictures that have appeared in the contributions of Opposition Members. We are not all the time speaking of those with incomes above £40,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some highly charged speeches have been made. The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) who was courteous enough to say that he could not remain in the Committee after the Adjournment of the House spoke of a party to which I, certainly, was not invited. I am not aware of the politics of the person for whom the party was given; I would not accept, unsubstantiated, the figures being bandied about it. However, I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman's speech contributed to public enlightenment on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When looking at the top rates of tax, we must cast our minds back to the years before 1979. In those days, the top rate on investment income was 98 per cent a year, and on earned income 83 per cent. I doubt whether Opposition Members will wish to do so, but perhaps some of my hon. Friends will remind me that at that time the only country in the world to have rates to match ours was Algeria. For reasons that have escaped me, Algeria subsequently slipped out of the batting order, and Togoland now leads. I yield to none in my admiration for those two countries, but I feel that their tax structures are adjusted to social circumstances that do not prevail here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find nothing to justify in our having spent modest sums in bringing down the top rates. Comparing this country with others at a similar stage of development, I do not find us out of line, and at certain points I think that we are less generous to top earners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To bring a little balance into the debate, I remind the Committee that if the figures commend themselves to the Committee and to the House, the top rate of 60 per cent in the United Kingdom will be reached by a married man without children at £43,665. In the United States, the top rate is 50 per cent—not 60 per cent and a married man without children reaches it at £158,425. The threshold for a lower top rate in the United States is three times that for the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the European Community, the Italian top rate is 65 per cent, but it is reached at £240,200; in Germany the top rate is 56 per cent, reached at £73,000. Finally, under a regime of which I am sure Opposition Members fully approve— a Socialist Government returned to power dedicated, originally at least, to the same objectives as the Labour party—in France the top rate is 67 per cent, and it is reached at £59,195.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If challenged on our figures, we can say that we are not out of line, and in many cases they are below those of our competitor countries. I have been asked to justify top rates of that order. Let me emphasise that managerial and entrepreneurial talent is scarce in any society, and moreover, it is highly mobile. the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, (Mr. Fisher)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
expresses dissent to my views. That he knows a little about business. I judge from his contributions. When we are detached from the more general political principles and prejudices, he has made speeches that demonstrate a grasp of detail which has, I am sure, commanded the admiration of the Committee. It is a pity that he does not reproduce his real knowledge in debates of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may not have emerged clearly from interventions from the Opposition Benches, but we are discussing a modest measure which seeks to index the various bands by which the highest rate is reached. Had outsiders been listening only to the contributions of Opposition Members, they might not have appreciated that what we propose is that the point at which tax paid moves from 30 per cent to 40 per cent should be indexed from £15,400 a year to £16,200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the rate of inflation and brought up to £16,200. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is quick enough to appreciate that. We are told that people with such incomes are creatures of consuming greed for whom we should have no concern whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate at which one moves from 40 to 45 per cent is being indexed up from £18,200 to £19,200. That is below the figure that occurred to the right honourable Member for Sparkbrook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Chief Secretary is so wedded to the principle of indexation to inflation, why does he not apply it to the wages of teachers, civil servants, nurses, auxiliary workers, and others? Why is he only wedded to inflation to reduce taxation on the higher paid? Why does it not apply to everyone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to succumb to that, but I suspect that with your stern and proper regard for the rules of order, Miss Fookes, you would rule me out of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dodging!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not dodging. There will be plenty of occasion to deal with the proper principles that should be applied to the determination of wages in the public sector. People outside the Committee will be very interested to hear a full explanation of the Labour party's view on a prices and incomes policy. I should be outside the rules of order if I were to press Labour Members further on that tonight. I prefer to stick to the point at issue, because there is plenty of material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of indexation, the Government doubled the increase in basic personal allowances. If we are to be accused of meanness, it should be in respect of people earning between £15,400 and £40,200, because we have done only a fair indexation job for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Chief Secretary acknowledge that percentages, particularly the two that he has just mentioned, can be very misleading? I am sure that he would not wish to mislead the Committee. He referred to the married man's allowance which was over-indexed by 10 per cent, effectively providing about £300 more. He also said that earnings of just over £40,000 were merely indexed to the rate of inflation—approximately 5 per cent. Surely he recognises that 5 per cent of £40,000 is worth £2,000 a year, rather than £300 which is added to the married man's allowance. The cash is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
important and the percentages are very misleading. The disparity between those amounts is £1,700 of real money after tax. That is a lot. The difference in income between the two groups has widened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is self evident. That is why one is always looking for flashes of enlightenment. The point. s that the differentials have been squeezed because basic allowances have been indexed by either 9.5 or 10 per cent, while the higher rate bands have been indexed by a mere 4.6 per cent. However, the hon. Gentleman has made some very telling remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full year cost of the proposals in the clause will be £155 million. The full year cost of our proposals for the basic allowances is £1.5 billion. That does not show a mean approach to the problems. Let us get the proposals in perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cavalier approach to facts of some Opposition Members is quite staggering. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who sometimes gets carried away with his own intoxicating rhetoric, said that every taxpayer was worse off under the Conservative Administration. The appropriate figures have been given on several occasions—first and most tellingly by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have reminded hon. Members before about sedentary interventions. I hope that I shall not have to do so again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me remind the Committee that someone on average earnings or a married couple with two children on half average earnings, average earnings, one and a half times average earnings or twice average earnings, is perceptively better off in take-home pay this year and during the six years that we have been in Government than under the Labour Government. Those are the facts and they will bear close analysis from any source. Our record of concern for less well-off taxpayers stands close examination and comparison with that of the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Chief Secretary's figures for direct taxation are correct to a large degree, but would they not be more credible if there had not been a swing to indirect taxation, which has adversely affected the lower paid? The swing has nearly, if not completely, offset the advantages they gained from the changes in direct taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would profit from sitting at the feet of his noble Friend, Lord Barnett, with whom I have had many agreeable encounters in this Room. I rest my case on what Lord Barnett said on several occasions. VAT is nothing like as regressive as we thought. That is a self-evident proposition when one considers how many of the necessities of life lie outside the charge to tax. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to ponder that thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that why the proportion of tax taken in indirect tax in this country is the highest in the Western world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the debate continues, I must point out that a comparison with VAT is not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
germane to the clause. It raises far wider issues and it is not appropriate to deal with VAT or any other form of tax now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I loyally abide by your ruling, Miss Fookes. I should be delighted on another and more appropriate occasion to demonstrate what proportion of tax is taken by VAT and other indirect taxes in this country in comparison with our competitors in Europe, but I bow to your stern but appropriate warning now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A regrettable gap in our debate is that we learn only imperfectly and all too often at second hand the Labour party's position on any particular fiscal question. The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) said perfectly properly that she could forecast a Budget that in an improbable and unforeseen combination of circumstances the right honourable Member for Spark-brook might introduce. The public is entitled to know in broad terms the thrust of the Labour party's direct tax policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precise position on the £20,000 cut-off point has been made absolutely clear and I shall not reopen the debate. We understand that there will be disaggregation of the incomes of husband and wife. That is a laudable and interesting objective and I am sure that the Labour party will produce costings and demonstrate how it will achieve that. But that is material for another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I blush to use words of such crudity, but what is interesting is the statement that people are "bloody rich" to earn more than £20,000. That is apparently the starting point to the Labour party's approach to the question of the higher rate bands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that even after indexation, the lowest of the higher rate bands will be £16,200 per annum, so they are not "bloody rich" by the right honourable Gentleman's test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I deplore such words used in this context. I do not think that they are appropriate for a Committee, which should retain a certain dignity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely defer to you, Miss Fookes. I would not have been so grossly insensitive as to use those words had I not been citing an important passage from an important speech by the right honourable Member for Sparkbrook. I apologise to the Committee and especially to you, Miss Fookes, for having to repeat words of such indecency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some candid remarks on record, and we appreciate candour. The country eventually has to choose between the fiscal policies of two—maybe three or four—of the major parties of state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) spoke about penal rates of taxation to provide incentives to work harder. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central believes in a penal tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never used the words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly give way to the hon. Gentleman if he would like to remind me of the precise words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Chief Secretary will recall, if he refers to his notes, that I referred to a move towards greater equality and equal distribution of incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman went on to say—I hope that this will be noted by those outside the House—that he invited people to enjoy their incomes while they could because things would be very different in two years' time. That is an intelligible standpoint. I only hope that it is put clearly to the electorate on the hustings. We want to know where the Labour Party stands on these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to rest the Conservative case on what we have done—for people on half average earnings, average earnings, on one and a half times average earnings, on twice average earnings, and for those on the basic rate. We cut the basic rate by three points in 1979, and it was much appreciated by many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are indexing the higher rate bands, and I do not feel an iota of shame for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Chief Secretary refer to families on half average earnings? He will know that their tax burden has increased by 100 per cent under the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, the hon. Gentleman has got it slightly wrong. Between 1978–79 and 1984–85, the take-home pay for families after tax and national insurance contributions increased by 12 per cent. The hon. Gentleman should check on his facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting debate. I was challenged to explain what was the pay-off and why we were doing all this. There is an elementary measure of justice. By my standards, marginal rates of 83 per cent and 98 per cent are confiscation and not taxation. Many distinguished managers of great companies who have provided much of the employment of this country have had their salaries itemised, picked apart and much cavilled at by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Giordano's name was mentioned by Labour Members. I cannot tell what he will do as a result of what we have done. Many young men and women have to decide whether they will make their careers in industry and commerce to provide jobs and prosperity for the coming generation. They will take note of the tax rates being advocated by the political parties. They may not see themselves earning the dizzy salaries that were outlined, but once they have studied what Opposition Members have said in this and other debates, they will realise that the tax policies that we are delicately teasing out of The Opposition in debate after debate mean that they will be living in a no-hope country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the philosophic basis on which we operate. Today we are debating some very modest increases, by reference to rates of inflation, for people earning £15,400 and more. It is an elementary measure of justice and good sense that these bands should be indexed. On that basis, I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will have noticed, Miss Fookes, that only two political parties are represented here this evening. Neither half of the uneasy alliance is present to give its views.

I welcome the retraction of the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo).

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of his remarks., the Chief Secretary spoke of the possibility of a Labour Government increasing the tax rates on the better-off and said that industrialists and other young people would leave the country because they would regard it as a no-hope country. I remind him that for four million people we are already living in a no-hope country, and that more than one million of them have been waiting for more than 12 months to find another job. For them, this is indeed a no-hope country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up one or two points in the Chief Secretary's speech. He referred to my article about China and the reintroduction of an incentive system there. The range of monthly salaries following the introduction of an incentive system is from 70 yuan—the basic rate for a factory worker; it can be increased by bonuses—to 300 yuan for university professors. There must be many factory workers at British Oxygen or shop assistants at Marks and Spencer or clerical workers at the Prudential who would be glad to have half, a third or even a quarter of the wages earned by their bosses. So the right honourable and learned Gentleman should not be carried away by what I said about China in that article. The differentials there are much narrower than those which apply here and which have been made much worse by his alteration of the tax system. Beyond that, I can only say that China does not have a system of personal income tax, so a discussion about higher rate bands is quite out of place in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) made much play of the rise in real take-home pay. They said that that should be our major concern, and that the increases have taken place during this Government's six years in office. Let me refer them both to a careful study of the first table provided by the Financial Secretary in response to my parliamentary question. As the Chief Secretary has chosen to look at the increase in real net earnings for those on half average earnings and so on, I shall take one or two similar examples that illustrate the cause of our complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "real net earnings" means earnings after income tax, national insurance contributions, contracted-out contributions and child benefit where appropriate. Childless married couples on half average earnings have seen a 7.9 per cent increase in their real net earnings since 1978–79 and married couples with two children have seen a 9.4 per cent increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it would be confusing to take too many examples from the table, I shall take only one other, by way of contrast. Childless married couples on ten times average earnings have seen a 61 per cent increase in their real net earnings while married couples with two children have seen a 59 per cent increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While those percentage figures help us to see the size of the differential, we must remember that a 9 per
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
cent increase in real net earnings for someone on half average earnings means far less in terms of buying power than a 61 or 59 per cent increase in real net earnings for someone on ten times average earnings. In the latter case the increases are enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gap between the two groups is enormous and that is our main complaint. We are talking about the contrast between the lot of the rich and the poor—the deliberate distortion of the tax system in order to benefit those on above-average earnings. Whether we consider the increase in the tax burden or the increase in real net earnings, that distortion is perfectly obvious, and the unfairness involved is our main complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to wind up quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary said that some Labour Members had given the impression in the past that they looked to taxation as the source of large sums with which to benefit the poorer in society. I do not think that the Labour party has ever seriously thought that it is so much a question of raising vast sums of additional revenue. Our search is rather for fairness in the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount spent on the relief of taxation for those subject to the higher rates of tax may have been comparatively small—£85 million one year and £160 million another. But let us remind the Chief Secretary and his hon. Friends that when the Opposition have asked for such sums to be spent on the poor perhaps to make a minor alteration to a benefit in the social security system or perhaps for a hospital here or a school there—the Government have denied them to us, saying that they cannot be afforded. Even when we have talked about £100 million or so that is the response that we have had from the Government. That is why we resent the tax system being used to benefit those who are sufficiently well-off not to need any particular benefit or to require any particular incentive from the Government for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary said that he has listened to such debates for many years. I wish that he would learn a little. Of course the same points have to be made over and over again because the ideological rift between him and the Opposition is wide indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to see a fair and equitable tax system. The Chief Secretary wishes to see, and has been instrumental in bringing about, a tax system that benefits those with well above average earnings and has often penalised those below that level. That is why we must keep repeating the points. The ideological rift between us will remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
