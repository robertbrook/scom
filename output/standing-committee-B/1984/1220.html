</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham (St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will recall, Sir. John, that at the end of Tuesday's, sitting, some forty-five and half hours ago, I received instructions to protract the debate on Clause 4. Now I see that those hon. Members from both sides of the Committee who instructed me did so with the ablest and most sincere intentions in the interests of the Committee. During that forty-five and a half hours there have been born three amendments which have floated in to join this group and which I welcome wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 63 appears in the name of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and once again his support of the film industry is shown by his productivity in its best interests. The amendment goes to the heart of the remarks that I made towards the end of the last sitting. Even though some of the earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
amendments stood partly in my name I was not entirely happy about them because, the Minister had made it clear in an intervention that he had it in mind that the son might become the provider under subclause (3). That suggestion flew in the face of all that we had tried to achieve in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said during our last sitting, the functions under clause 4(1)(a) and (b) are different. If an utterly independent chief executive is to be appointed to this company he may be able to deal with the provisions of clause 4(1)(a). However, I envisage a potential conflict of interests particularly if we wish to protect the independent sector directors under clause 4(1)(b). The tenor of my remarks expressed my great fears on both the drafting of the clause and the Minister's comments. I say that with all due kindness and festive greetings to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) who was also unhappy with our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North is not the only hon. Member who has been busy. My name has again been taken in vain and I find that I am party to two new amendments, which have also floated on to the amendment paper. I am happy with those two amendments even though they are in the alternative. We are presenting the Minister with a range of options in the form of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take on board the spirit behind the last forty-five and a half hours and that they have convinced him that movement is more than required in this matter. If the chief executive is to be independent, it is important that we protect the independent director. The best way to do that is to have someone to administer that section of the industry along the lines that I outlined earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wait with interest to see whether my first glance this morning will mean that my dreams are about to be realised or whether I am to be disappointed again. If I am to be disappointed, I give notice that I intend to fight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendments Nos. 63 and 65, which are entirely interchangeable, is to ensure that advice is not given from the same source to which it is intended to be applied. If the recipient of funds is to be the adviser as to how much, when, why or for what purpose the money is to be used, there will be a question mark over its propriety. The adviser to the Minister must be divorced from any connection with the recipient of ministerial munificience. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that that is the case. My hon. Friend the Minister, may assure us that that will be the case. If so, I shall not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain briefly the two amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and me? As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, Souyth (Mr. Bermingham) pointed out, they are, in a sense, alternatives. They point in different directions, from a practical viewpoint, but are intended to achieve the same result: that an element of independence should be established in the counsel available to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) pointed out, amendment No. 65 is drafted in similar terms to his amendment and is designed to secure a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
Source of advice and an institutional focus outside the successor company to the NFFC. I should be happy if that were the route that the Minister chose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 64 takes a different direction but has the same outcome, which is that if the Minister insists that it is to be the successor company which fulfils the role and is the person appointed under clause 4(3), we should accept that. However, we should make it the vehicle by which the chief executive of that company is to be appointed by the Minister to fulfil an independent role. In either event, it is that element of independence which we seek. I hope that the minister will be able to satisfy the Committee in one direction or another but firmly to achieve that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) said, certain members of the Committee were anxious to give me more time to reflect on the Government's intention regarding the person—in the legal sense—proposed. As I said at our last sitting, it is envisaged that the son of NFFC would be that person. It is important to stress that I intervened when I did in order to be helpful to the Committee. One does not have to be very bright to work out that if the Committee had continued to deliberate on the points made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and then I had revealed in a winding-up speech that the person we intended to nominate was the son of NFFC, we should have had yet another debate which would have lasted for about three hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to meet as many of the points which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have made. I am grateful for the time that I have had to consider the matter and talk it through with my officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little surprised that terminology such as "thunderstruck" was used by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton). I know him extremely well and he would not have feigned surprise. Clearly, he was shocked. However, I should point out that we had spelt out the matter in the White paper, which states in paragraph 7.6:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would he inappropriate for this"—</p></blockquote>
the assessment of potential film projects—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be operated by the Government, and we would envisage having the entire scheme operated by some other organisation acting as the Government's agents. The company to be formed to operate the new fund for assisting British film talent"—</p></blockquote>
that refers to "son"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would seem the most appropriate place for this work to be carried out."</p></blockquote>
I listened carefully at the Committee's last sitting to what the hon. Member for St. Helens, South said. I thought that he may have had a point when he asked in an intervention during the speech of his hon. Friend the member for Dagenham:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does my hon. Friend agree that we have now completed the circle of lack of independence?" [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B, 18 December 1984; c.219.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That point certainly registered with me, and I have raised it during the past 24 hours with my officials. The hon. Gentleman laid stress on the importance of the word "independence" in connection with the chief executive and there I quarrel with him because I cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
see how a chief executive could be completely and utterly dependent. By definition, a chief executive is answerable either to some body or someone and it is clear from the Bill that, although we would like the chief executive to be as independent as possible, he would be answerable to the governing body of the son of NFFC. None the less, I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman at our last sitting that he wanted as much independence as possible, which was also stressed by the hon. member for Dagenham and my hon. Friend the member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered the matter further and I draw the attention of the Committee to page 16 of the White Paper where there is a passage which is somewhat ambiguous. I have already quoted from paragraph 7.6. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would seek, however, to move on from their current style of operation towards one which places more emphasis on funding an embryo production team and placing more responsibility on the team to come up with the right project, rather than adopt a relatively inflexible case-by-case approach."</p></blockquote>
One could take that passage to mean that we would dispense with the idea of having independent consultants and, certainly, that was in our minds. However, as a result of Tuesday's debate, it is important that there should be a degree of independence. Therefore, it is important that the son of NFFC should employ independent consultants to assess the projects. As a result of Tuesday's debate, it is now our intention to make it a condition of our contract with son in respect of the project development schemes that the consultants used must have no financial interest in son or the companies participating in it. I hope that that statement will dispel any confusion and allay any further fears that hon. Members may have. I also hope that it will reassure hon. members by confirming that we recognise and share their concern about the independence with which projects should be assessed and that we are taking steps to ensure that that independence is present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is of any comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North, he will be pleased to hear that I had given the instruction to the Sir Humphreys in the Department of Trade and Industry to change direction on that point and I did it all by my little self. Those of us who are junior Ministers have learnt a great deal from the right hon. James Hacker. I had the privilege and pleasure last week of meeting the right hon. James Hacker after a sitting of the Committee. I went up to and forced my attention on him. I was delighted to shake his hand, touch him and breathe the same air so that I could tell my children and my children's children that I had actually met the right hon. James Hacker. I made it clear to him that perhaps those of us who are junior Ministers were still trying to emulate his example. I did not have the courage to tell him that my wife had insisted about four months ago that I should see the programme for the first time. I had not seen it in the past and she thought that it was a necessary ingredient for the recipe of success. I am ashamed to admit that two thirds of the way through the programme my wife had to tell me that it was a weekly television comedy. I had thought that it was a documentary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: order. I must tell the Minister that the films Bill is not an entertainment Bill. Despite his analogy, he must keep a little closer to the point. The programme is a rotten one because it has no Chairman of a Standing Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to sit down, Sir John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that a single viewing of "Yes, Minister" has produced such a change of heart in the Minister. Perhaps that is the explanation for the welcome recantation and the move towards the opinions expressed throughout the Committee on the important issue of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has gone a long way. The one caveat that I must make and that we must bear in mind during the further stages of the Bill is that we are again invited to rely on the terms of the contract rather than an amendment to the legislation to secure the objective which the Minister and the Committee seek. We shall wish to look very closely at and will expect the fullest possible disclosure of the terms of negotiation and the contract with regard to this issue and many others. Unless Conservative Members wish to press the matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the movement by the Minister. Will not my hon. Friend agree that we are back to the terms and conditions of the contract? Perhaps the wisest course of action would be to withdraw the amendment until we see the terms of the contract and reserve our position on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend takes the words from my mouth. I was about to make the same suggestion. Unless there is a strong desire to press it to a division, my inclination is to withdraw the amendment on the clear understanding that we shall wish to return to the matter if we feel on Report that the information about the contract is not satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that this is the first time in the Committee that the Minister has made it absolutely clear that he gave an undertaking that that would be in the contract. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that that is encouraging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I trust that the Minister understood exactly what he said. On past occasions he and his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i> Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 4, line 40, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(cc) The national Film and Television School, in whose case a minimum annual grant of £2 million, up-rated annually in line with the Retail Price Index, shall be made."</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to the future of the National Film and Television school and reflects the great anxiety felt by Opposition Members, which I am sure is shared by Conservative Members, about the welfare and future of the school. The amendment simply seeks to place a duty on the Government to make a minimum annual grant of £2 million to the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline some of the background of the National Film and Television school. Its existence has been guaranteed so far by the 1970 Act, which is being repealed by this Bill. The Act stipulates that there shall be a national school. At present, the school has three-year courses specialising in training producers, directors, writers, lighting and camera operators, editors, animators, art directors and sound recordists. About 25 students are admitted each year, with five places reserved for overseas students. The average age of students is 25 years. There are also short courses for retraining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the repeal of the 1970 Act by this Bill, which does not name the National Film and Television school, would rob the school of any legislative existence. The Act stipulates that there shall be a school. This legislation makes no mention of the school. So part of our reason for tabling the amendment is that we feel that it should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White paper and the Minister' ads speech on Second Reading merely outline the agreement that the Minister reached with the BBC and independent companies and—I believe that I quote the Minister correctly—the cinemas, to provide funds. In our view, that is not a sufficient guarantee of the school's existence. I believe that the agreements between the Government and the companies which, apparently, have agreed to put money into the school, are in the form of letters. The agreements are due to last only for five years, and there is no guarantee beyond that five-year period. Our major concern, therefore, is about the removal of legislative existence and the existence of guarantees only in the form of agreement between the Minister and particular companies or organisations, and only for a period of five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the letters from the BBC and the independent television companies, agreeing to their contribution for the future of the National Film and Television school, specifically agreed to make that contribution on the understanding that there should be no levy on the showing of films on television. That caveat, which was inserted into their agreement to the future funding arrangement, to which the Minister referred on Second Reading and which was included in the White Paper, has been removed by the Committee by an earlier decision. So that raises a further question mark about the degree of security that we can place on the agreement so far entered into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the present sources of money for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
school. It receives funds from three principal sources—the Eady subvention, through the British Film Fund Agency; the Office of Arts and Libraries, which is part of the Department of Education and Science; and the BBC and independent television companies. The approximate contributions in the year ending April 1984 were £95,000 from ITV companies, £45,000 from the BBC, £500,000 from the Eady levy, and just under £1 million from the Office of Arts and Libraries. That makes a total income of about f1,640,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1984–85 figures, some of which are at present merely requested or required figures not yet confirmed, show that the Office of Arts and Libraries has again given just under £1 million, that the Eady levy has produced £600,000, that ITV is scheduled to give £160,000 and the BBC £65,000, and that income from fees is approximately 00,000. The scheduled income for the coming year is slightly up on that, although the figures for ITV and the BBC are roughly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the continued existence of the school and to ensure that it can continue the excellent work that it currently does, it is essential that it be guaranteed the present level of funding in real terms. We are doubtful whether the agreements that the Government have so far entered into and the lack of security involved in those agreements will enable that amount of funding to be procured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we assume that the Office of Arts and Libraries continues to provide the £1 million or so that it does at present—at our last sitting, we heard that, although part of it is for one-off capital reasons, an increase in the coming financial year is projected—the school needs from the trade some E750,000 or £800,000 in order to ensure that it can continue at the same level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the abolition of the Eady levy, the Government's current proposals are that the trade should contribute only about £600,000 a year, and that is less than the school needs this current financial year to fund its existing operation. Not only that, it is less than it actually needed last year to fund its operations. Therefore, we can have little confidence that the funding level currently being projected by the Government—taking E600,000 from the trade to put into the National Film and Television school will he sufficient to enable the school to continue to do the same work, and offer the same courses and the same standard of teaching as at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also note that the three main contributors have done very well out of the Bill. I understand that they have each agreed to put in £200,000, making the figure of £600,000 that the Government are projecting. For the cinema companies, that is less than half their current contribution through the Eady levy. The BBC and the independent companies, although they will be paying more than they are at the moment, are doing so in the belief that they will be avoiding a levy on films shown on television, and I hope that the Minister will address that point when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three other points are worth making. First, it is not clear from either the White Paper or Second Reading whether the £250,000 which the Government propose to contribute to improve the school's television facilities is included in or is in addition to the Office of

Arts and Libraries' amount. I hope that the Government will give a specific response on that point.

Secondly, if the Minister claims that he is not depriving the school of statutory protection because it is not specifically mentioned in the 1970 Act, it should be pointed out that the National Film and Television school is de facto the only such school. It is unique. The fact that only one such school exists gives it that statutory protection. In repealing the 1970 Act, the Bill removes that protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the projected drop in funds poses a serious threat to short-course retraining schemes which keep workers in the industry up to date with technological change. Short courses, rather than the main training work, will suffer from a reduction in funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are seriously worried about a number of matters. We are concerned that the school's statutory protection will be removed by the repeal of the 1970 Act. We are concerned that the envisaged level of funding under the f600,000 agreement with the television companies and cinemas will be inadequate for the school to continue, even in the current year, the same work that it does at present, let alone allowing for inflation. There is no guarantee that the agreement will last beyond the five-year period. That is intended to include the amount provided by the Office of Arts and Libraries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not demanding that the Minister's own Department provides the funds. We are seeking to place a duty on the Exchequer as a whole rather than the Minister's own pocket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to put into statute the existence of the school and a level of funding that will guarantee that the school can continue its good work and even improve further on its excellent record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) on his concern for the National Film school. I am sure that it does an excellent job and needs proper funding. However, I shall try to persuade him that his amendment could be dangerous. Before doing so, I should like to comment on some of his figures. I understand that this excellent establishment trains people in the art of cinematography. Initially, most of those people find jobs in television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that as both the BBC and the ITA support the school they should avoid a levy on feature films. He will also remember the figures that are necessary for a levy on feature films. The amount of support given by the BBC and the ITA is ludicrously small compared with the amount necessary for television production. As most of the pupils seem to start their careers in television, surely the BBC and ITA should give the school greater support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a totally different issue to the principle of a levy on feature films.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very dangerous if cinemas had so large a share of the funding of the school that the aims of the school turned so much to television as though the cinema were non-existent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree that a balance must be kept. Considering the state of the British feature film industry, most of the pupils start in television. We have to accept that production is a logical progression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is dangerous to seek to put in a minimum annual grant even when it is tied to the retail price index. The temptation of any Government, of whatever party, not to keep to that minimum in times of change are huge. Times will change rapidly in this area in the next 10 years. I believe that without that figure one might sometimes persuade a benevolent Government in more prosperous times to give more than the minimum. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see it that way and withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) that the National Film and Television school does excellent work. I understand the motivation behind the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and his hon. Friends. But, like my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham, I wish to recommend that the Committee reject the amendment. Our White Paper recorded the fact that the school has attracted universal praise for its excellence and its responsiveness to the needs of industry. The Government therefore share the concern of those who want to see the school adequately funded. Indeed, the arrangements set out in the White Paper for its funding when the income from the Eady levy ceases are a practical demonstration of our concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried carefully to follow the hon. Gentleman when he tabulated the figures which the school received and, as far as I could ascertain from the speed at which he was speaking, he is broadly correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee are aware that the school is principally supported by my noble Friend Lord Gowrie through the Office of Arts and Libraries. The Government already support the school to a major extent. Our concern, in the review of film policy, has been simply to find a satisfactory way of replacing that part of the industry's own contribution which has so far come out of the Eady levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our negotiations with the industry we obtained commitments from three groups. First, the cinema sector, whose contribution may perhaps be viewed as a number of quids for the quo of being relieved of the burden of the Eady levy. Second, the independent television companies. Third, the BBC. These commitments, jointly totalling £600,000 a year, are more than the Eady levy currently provides and they are for a period of five years, the same period as the latest renewal of the Eady levy in 1980 was due to last. They are also an improvement on the present position in that television interests will in future contribute at a significant level. At the same time, the independence which the majority funding from my noble Friend provides means, I believe, that there need be no fears about the funding from television unduly influencing the school's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that I referred to the generous contribution which my noble Friend had recently made to the school. I am convinced that it will remain a film and television school. Indeed, we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
announced that we intend to make a special contribution next year of £250,000 to improve the television facility at the school. But it is also important that the industry should involve itself substantially in supporting the school—after all, it receives a steady stream of fully trained young men and women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not pre-empting what will be said later, but the Parliamentary Under- Secretary seems to have skipped over two specific questions which I asked. Will he be coming to those later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have them here and shall not try to duck them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insofar as my noble Friend Lord Gowrie already contributes sums in excess of those originally proposed in amendment No. 38, there can be no question of the Secretary of State making a contribution of at least £2 million, which would significantly exceed the total budget of the school; nor does it make sense to embody such a provision in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific point raised by the hon. Gentleman about the statutory provision, it is not correct to say that the school's existence is guaranteed by legislation. Its existence is merely recognised for the purpose of making it eligible as a recipient of the proceeds of the Eady levy. The Film Levy Finance Act 1981 replaced the Films Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My misgivings about the amendment are reinforced because I know it was not proposed with the approval or support of the school. Indeed I believe that the school would not willingly become overwhelmingly dependent on the state for its income, which would be the effect if the amendment were implemented. It would prefer to preserve its independence by seeking any increased funding which might be needed from the industry. If the schoolwrites to argue that it needs more money, I am prepared to hear the case and, if necessary, to raise the matter with the industry, but I cannot hold out any prospect of the Government increasing their already generous funding of the school. I invite my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I have found the Secretary of State's response unsatisfactory. I asked two specific questions which he failed to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question was whether the funding promised from the BBC and the ITV companies of £200,000 each per year—which was originally made on the understanding that there would be no levy on films shown on television—had now been removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the question should be phrased in a more subtle manner. It may be that it is not simply a matter of an agreement reached between the television companies and the Government. It may be a request embodied by the television companies in their statement of their position. We therefore need to know the Government's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting the matter rather more delicately than I did. The attitude of the television companies is none the less important, because we are considering an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
agreement between them and Government. We are not talking about statutory provision for funding. We are talking about a voluntary agreement which they have said that they are prepared to enter into. We need assurance that the f200,000 from each of those two bodies will not be endangered by decisions taken by the Committee and which we hope the Government will pursue further in respect of a levy on films shown on television. I hope the Minister will address himself to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister touched briefly on what he called the special contribution of £250,000. 1 understood from what he said that the £250,000 was in addition to the existing budget made available to the school from the Office of Arts and Libraries. If that is so, we welcome the Minister's statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I owe the hon. Gentleman an apology. When I was about to rise to my feet a note was passed to me about the hon. Gentleman's first question. Unfortunately I did not have time to read it, but I have now done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the second question about the £250,000 is yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the first question is that it is true that the independent companies' undertaking to make a contribution to the school was linked to there being no levy on films shown on television. We are telling them that the Government are considering the position in the light of the proposed levy, but at this stage I obviously cannot anticipate the outcome of those further developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that, my fears are even greater than they were when I moved the amendment. If that is the case, and the television companies at the moment are not guaranteeing £400,000, a very substantial sum of money indeed is needed by the National Film and Television school to ensure its existence. We are told that that contribution is now under question and discussion by the Government and the companies concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend yet again, but I am anxious to avoid the problem which confronted the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) in an earlier debate. That is why I intervene in his speech before he perhaps asks leave to withdraw his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is surely right that the Minister's comments reinforce our concern—because here. is a practical example of exactly what we feared—about the nature of the negotiations taking place to put into effect many of the assurances which the Minister has been able to give us. Surely that now places an even greater premium on a frank disclosure by the Minister of all the matters currently being adumbrated in the negotiations. A clear statement of those issues needs to be put on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the last remarks of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), I do not see, from all that I have said, how the Government can
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
make clearer the support which they wish to give the Bill. Also, my noble Friend Lord Gowie has given a 13 per cent. increase in funding to the school. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) poured some scorn on that at our last sitting. I suggest to him and his hon. Friends that that increase has introduced a degree of flexibility which is absolutely necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Minister has missed the point of our discussion. My hon. Friend's point was that in discussing the Bill and this amendment in particular, we are having to depend on the Minister's assurances about discussions being held with other bodies, contracts being drawn up and requirements which the Government intend to lay upon parties to agreements which have not yet been tabled and do not yet exist. Effectively, we are being asked to take legislation on trust—and that the Government will be successful in reaching the agreements which they intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The television companies' original statement was that they were prepared to give a contribution of f400,000, on the understanding that there would be no levy on films shown on television. The question mark which must hang over that projected funding gives us much concern about the future of the school, however good the Government's intentions may be, because we do not have a firm guarantee that the funding will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the Minister has failed to address himself to the funding needed by the school to carry on its present form of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to the figures, because they are extremely important. Funding in the current financial year made available to the National Film and Television school is f600,000 from the Eady levy, a projected £160,000 from ITV and £65,000 from the BBC. That chunk of funding from television and Eady—£825,000—will be replaced by only £600,000 under the Government's proposed agreement. Of that sum, £400,000 has an enormous question mark hanging over it because it was subject to the caveat put on it by the television companies. We must be concerned about where the extra money will come from. The Government will replace an existing current level of funding of £825,000 from the trade with only £600,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary failed to satisfy my concern about the future work of the school, what it is doing and how it will pay for its courses if there is such a reduction in funding. I hope that the Minister will be able to show more clearly how the Government expect the National Film and Television school to continue its present work with the levels of funding envisaged under the proposed agreement. I hope that he will be able to give us greater cause for rejoicing than he has done so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have little to add. I think that the hon. Gentleman should clear lines of communication between himself and the school, because it is not saying the same thing. I should stress that it is the Government's wish and the school's preference that from the Eady levy to which the funds he referred should be replaced by the industry itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government may be intent on overturning the Committee's decision that there should be a levy on the television companies. Press reports suggest that that is so. If it is, it is regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let us assume that the Government intend to accept the Committee's view. Now that we know that the television companies' offer to make a contribution to the funding of the National Film and television school depends on there being no levy, two unfortunate possibilities arise. One is that the Government will be forced—as the price they pay for the offer—to abandon the Committee's view that there should be a levy. Or the Government stick to their view, in which case the school cannot avail itself of the offer made by the television companies. Either way, the outcome is not only very uncertain but very unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has pinpointed one of the two basic issues which the Government have so far failed to address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the first part of my hon. Friend's speech, as I had to attend to another urgent matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand it correctly, the television companies are suggesting a form of blackmail—surrender the levy or else we shall not pay for the school. That is quite wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has not understood the matter correctly. In principle, his point is correct. While he was unavoidably detained outside, I said that the original offer of f400,000 from the television companies as a contribution to the school was made on the understanding—we have confirmation from the Minister of that—that there would be no levy on films shown on television. Now that the Committee has decided that there should be a levy on such films the Minister has told us that there is a question mark over that source of future funding for the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that perhaps a very simple solution to the matter—perhaps it is a commercial negotiating point—is that the donation to the school is considered as part of the levy raised? That might salve everybody's conscience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking in hypothetical terms, but I hope that the money raised by a levy, such as that agreed by the Committee, on films shown on television will be devoted in part to the future welfare of the school and the work it is doing, because it is one of the major sources of talent for the film and television industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that there were two issues to which theGovernment had failed to address themselves. The first is the question mark over the funding. The Minister's reply on that was not good enough. The second is the issue of overall funding. The Minister may say that the school welcomes the fact that the Eady levy is being replaced by joint funding from television companies and cinemas, but he has not told us why, or how, he believes that £600,000 is sufficient. Clearly, the figures that I have given the Committee, that sum is not sufficient to fund the school's existing level
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
of operation, let alone the needs of the school in the future with inflation taking a bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that I am severely disappointed by the Minister's reply—I hope that he will go away and consider these matters further with his officials—the amendment as specifically drafted with the requirement of £2 million may not be the best and happiest way to progress the matter. However, I wish to reserve the right to return to the matter in further discussions on the Floor of the House, and accordingly feel that it may be in the interests of the Committee if I withdraw the amendment now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'> Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CERTIFICATION OF MASTER NEGATIVES, TAPES AND DISCS FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 72 OF FINANCE ACT 1982</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call any hon. Member to speak, I must point out to the Committee that if clause 5 stands part of the Bill, new clause 9 will automatically fall. Therefore, although one cannot group amendments with a stand part debate, clearly it would be convenient at this juncture if we debated new clause 9—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>Qualification for the purposes of section 72 of the Finance Act 1982—</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, any film, any tape or disc which would have but for the passing of this Act, qualified for the purposes of section 72 of the Finance Act 1982, shall continue so to qualify'.</p></blockquote>
I suggest that we do likewise, as the principle is the same, with amendment No. 54, in clause 6, page 6, line 33, leave out subsection (5),
<br><br><!-- lb -->
and the two amendments grouped with it, namely amendment No. 30, in clause 6, page 6, line 41, leave out subsection (6),
<br><br><!-- lb -->
and amendment No. 55, in clause 6, page 7, line 1, leave out subsection (7),
<br><br><!-- lb -->
as well as amendment No. 56 in clause 7, page 7, line 7, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although those amendments are to subsequent clauses, it might be convenient and more sensible to debate them together, if that is acceptable to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to you, Sir John, for your guidance which I and my hon. Friends are happy to follow. I believe that it will be for the convenience of the Committee if we look briefly at this stage at the range of issues canvassed by clause 5, the amendments to clauses 6 and 7 and new clause 9 in the hope that we need not return to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 introduces the vexed subject of capital allowances and what is to qualify as a film for that purpose. I do not propose to weary the Committee by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
going back over ground that was well traversed on Second Reading and in other debates about the crucial importance to the film industry of the availability of capital allowances and the immense disappointment and sense of betrayal that it felt when, in contradiction to clear ministerial assurances, it learnt that it is now proposed to phase out and withdraw those capital allowances in any effectively valuable form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the question of the link between the definitions proposed in the Bill and section 72 of the Finance Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on the hon. Gentleman's earlier phrase about the betrayal felt by the film industry as a result the withdrawal of the Capital allowance system as it affected the film industry, but does he not agree that nobody could have envisaged, when the orginal capital allowance system for the film industry was agreed, that corporation tax itself would almost be phase out, or certainly reduced to a very small percentage of the Company profits over such a short period? Therefore, while I agree about the short-term problems of making films, in the long term the changing rates of corporation tax are to the benefit of profitable film makers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense the hon. Gentleman makes a fair point when he says that the overall change in the relationship between capital allowances and the rates of corporation tax was intended to serve a wider economic purpose. I might say in passing, though it is scarcely relevant to our proceedings, that it is a change with which I have some sympathy. I have always felt that an effective rate of corporation tax was an important reform to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem from the viewpoint of the film industry, however, because of the uncertain profitability of making films and so on, is that the removal of the capital allowance concession—that incentive to investments—has left the film industry without a corresponding advantage and also, with the removal of the levy and the other changes that have taken place, with inadequate possibilities of attracting investment. Those are issues, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that we have discussed at some length on earlier occasions. I take his point, but one must concede that the film industry is still left in a particularly difficult position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the assuarance that we received from the Minister earlier in Committee in respect of the business expansion scheme and his willingness to look again and to listen again, particularly to representations from the film industry with regard to this sort of funding, was most welcome, but it is all part of an overall package? If the Minister, who is clearly addicted to the business expansion scheme—as he sought to convince me throughout our sittings—were to honour that undertaking, and I am sure that he will honour it to the utmost, perhaps we could end up with an overall fiscal package of arrangements which work to the benefit of the industry and could perhaps overcome some of the problems caused by the removal of capital allowances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend uses the word "addiction". I am not sure that that is the right way to describe the Minister's relationship with the scheme, which I think is a rather more paternal or filial relationship. Despite my hon. Friend's accurate welcome for the Minister's assurances, I think that Opposition Members generally, probably with the support of the industry, still have some reservations about the potential of the business expansion scheme to help the actual production of films as opposed to project development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may make one further general point arising from these interventions. Where, as in this case, Governments, perhaps for good reasons, have to go back on clear ministerial assurances, that does not help an industry to develop faith and confidence in future ministerial assurances. It is again worth noting that we are having to place great reliance on ministerial assurances rather than on amendments written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, I now turn to the question raised by the clause and by the other amendments and the new clause. Clearly changes in the definition of a qualifying film are proposed and effected by the Bill. One could say that as capital allowances are no longer of any great consequence to the film industry and as qualification for the purposes of section 72 is the main reason for the proposed definition, it is a hypothetical question. But we live in hope, and we must look towards the day when the Finance Act or a future films Bill will revive a system of tax or investment incentives for the film industry. In that case the definition of a British film would again become very important for the purposes of qualifying for any incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In that case the definition of a British film would again become very important for the purposes of qualifying for any incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are obliged to look carefully at the definitions, which will arise on the schedules. For the purposes of clause 5, can the Minister tell us the main differences between the definitions proposed in the Bill and the present situation? How much do those differences matter? If the differences are substantive—one must assume that substantive differences are proposed—transitional problems will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Copinger Society, which I remind the Committee is a body comprising almost all the solicitors involved in the film and entertainments industry, has pointed out that a number of contracts will be entered into for films to be delivered after the Bill is enacted. Those contracts will be drawn up on the assumption that the films to be made will qualify as films for the purposes of section 72, and indeed the contracts may contain warrantees to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be grave anxieties among those already party to those contracts or proposing to enter into them, because they cannot be certain that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
warrantees that they give or the contracts that they enter into can be met. Clause 6(6) will provide for yet more flexibility because it will give the Minister the power to introduce further statutory instruments to change the requirements in the transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can allay some of those doubts by pointing to provisions in the Bill which I take to be designed to deal with any transitional problems. I am thinking particularly of clause 6(5) and (7) and clause 7(2), which is designed to provide an extended transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know whether substantive differences are proposed and whether the Bill adequately takes care of contracts that are drawn up and are to be executed in accordance with what is understood to be the present requirement. We need an assurance that no film that has been produced or contract that has been entered into before the Bill is enacted will be prejudiced or excluded from the provisions of section 72 by the changed definition in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can give those assurances, we may be able to dispense with debates on succeeding amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The policy of giving the Minister time to think has tempted me yet again. I thought that as there was only an hour and 20 minutes to go, it would give him the whole of Christmas. But then I thought that perhaps we should not spoil his Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, perhaps the Minister and his officials will consider over the Christmas break what my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has said. The Minister can have Christmas off, provided he starts his considerations on 26 December. The points that have been raised are extremely important. I hope that my hon. Friend will not seek to oppose clause 5 at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not too happy with the amendments tabled to clause 6, or, indeed, with new clause 9, because in the birth of a film there are two stages—development and production—and each must be considered separately and the incentives and allowances given at each stage carefully covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already demonstrated some signs of creative thinking in listening to the Committee. I hope that that development will not be stifled, but allowed to mature between now and Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am being very careful, Sir John, not to trespass beyond the bounds of the debate, but as you suggested to us earlier clause 6 and schedule 1 are interlinked. However, they ought to be tidied up and the points raised by the Copinger society noted, particularly on those matters that are now in the process of negotiation and may reach contractual stage before the Act comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that under clause 6(6) the Secretary of State has power to lay statutory instruments. I welcome that power and ask my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham to accept my reservations about amendment No. 30, which we are also debating, that seeks to remove that provision from the Bill. In the peculiar circumstances of the film industry, which is exceptional and does not run along normal commercial lines, wholly exceptional measures have to be taken to
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
protect it in such cases, and perhaps statutory instruments are the best method of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I await with interest the Minister's reply. I urge him, and his officials, to make use of the time before Report stage, because certain drafting amendments could be tabled by the Government to remove many of our fears, provided that the Minister is in spirit with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already shown that I am in spirit with the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). He said that I am addicted to the business expansion scheme. He was absolutely right, and his hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) should not have corrected him. At the risk of hammering the nails out of sight, I must draw the Committee's attention to an article in this week's 	<i>Screen International</i>—one of the leading film trade journals—referring to the business expansion scheme and a package that is being put together for Goldcrest. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) will be interested to hear that. The package will raise several millions of pounds, and that helps to reinforce the arguments that I deployed at our last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main question that the hon. Member for Dagenham put to me was about the differences between the old and the new definitions. The answer is that newsreels, Government films and advertising films will in future be regarded as British if they meet the other requirements that apply to all films. The basic definition remains unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5, taken together with schedule 1, provides for the definition and certification of British films. The form in which films come does, of course, vary and the clause and the schedule therefore refer to master negatives, tapes and discs. The reasons for the process of identifying a film as British and then certifying it as such are many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 72 of the Finance Act 1982—which deals with tax allowances available in respect of expenditure on the production or acquisition of films—requires that these allowances and arrangements are available for British films only. The present position under existing legislation is to use the Eady levy qualifying criteria to determine which films may, or may not, qualify under the Finance Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the removal of the Eady levy and the repeal of the Films Acts 1960 and 1980 as provided for in clause 1, some other means of defining which films are British and which are therefore eligible for tax allowances is required. Schedule 1 fulfils that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the definition of British films is necessary in relation to clause 3. We have already debated at very great length the question of the role and activities of "son of NFFC". Clause 3(3) states that the company must use its best endeavours to encourage the production of relevant films, and that it must be willing and able to make financial facilities available to persons who wish to arrange for the production of relevant films. A relevant film is defined later in clause 3 as a film that is intended to be a British film as defined in schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already made clear in our earlier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
discussions about "son", it is correct for us to limit the right to use the NFFC's portfolio of film rights to a company that intends to use it, together with its own money, to encourage the production of British films. The schedule provides an appropriate means of identifying British films for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the financial assistance the Secretary of State may give under clause 4(1) to "son" or specifically for pre-production work must also be in relation to the production of relevant or British films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, as hon. Members will be aware, the United Kingdom has film co-production treaties with five other countries—France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Norway. The previous legislative provision on co-production treaties is continued in this Bill, but to be effective it requires a means of defining British films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the ability to define British films is necessary for a reason unconnected with this Bill or with any other legislation. Regardless of any tangible benefit or tax allowance that may be conferred by certification under the schedule, there is a much wider reason why we need to define and certify British films. It is important in marketing films world wide to be able to state that the film is British and that it follows the tradition of other British films so that we maintain the image of the British film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it is equally important to have a wider definition of the word "British" because of copyright legislation that is apparently in the pipeline?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that may be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were concerned that the Bill might not include all the necessary transitional and saving provisions referred to by the hon. Member for Dagenham. We feared that, as a result, some film makers who were already making films might be disadvantaged by the changes to the law proposed by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already identified two areas that are not provided for in the Bill and I propose to introduce provisions on Report to deal with them. The first problem would arise where a film was completed after the Bill was passed but was exhibited in the cinema before the Eady levy was terminated. The film maker should be entitled to his appropriate share of the final distribution of Eady money. However, with the Bill in its present form, such a film would not be entitled to an Eady payment because it could not be registered as a British film. Clause 1 comes into effect only when the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem would occur if films were begun but not completed before the Act was passed. Under the present law they would be eligible for tax relief but they would not be eligible after the Bill was passed. I admit that those situations are likely to be rare, but they need to be catered for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much advance publicity of the Government's intentions, not only on publication of the White Paper but since publication of the Bill. No film maker who has entered into a contract to produce or acquire a film before the Bill becomes law should be put at a financial disadvantage. I am sure that the hon. Member for Dagenham would agree with that
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
objective. If I am confident that all such possibilities have been covered by transitional or saving provisions, I shall remove clause 6(6) and (7) on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my Department and I, or even the Committee, may have overlooked some possibility that would result in a serious injustice to a current film maker. Without these provisions, nothing could be done to amend an oversight. I hope that I have made my intentions clear and that hon. Members will support clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say briefly that I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PRESERVATION OF NITRATE STOCKS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall by order establish a scheme for the preservation of nitrate film stocks held in the Pathe Film Library and the Movietone Library, to be financed by equal contributions from Government sources and the companies concerned, at a level which would enable the copying of all stock on to acetate by the year 2000". —[	<i>Mr. Chris Smith</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause relates to a very specific problem which is none the less of great concern. I raised this problem during the Government's initial statement on film policy and also on Second Reading. The Minister said on both occasions that he shared my concern. I have tabled the new clause to try to find out how the Government intend to tackle a real and practical problem in our national film archives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises because until 1951 virtually all film was made on a base of nitro cellulose. It can therefore be described as nitrate film stock. It produced excellent photographic quality but it is subject to inevitable and irreversible chemical decay as well as becoming readily and dangerously inflammable. It therefore has to be stored carefully in extremely secure conditions. Moreover, if we wish to preserve the images that are recorded on it, the nitrate stock has to copied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period after which deterioration sets in is variable and the instability pattern of nitrate stock can be difficult to predict precisely. However, most experts agree that the lifespan of even the very last nitrate stock produced just before 1951 is unlikely to last much beyond the year 2000. Copying on to video tape does not provide an adequate alternative. The results tend to have poorer quality and there are doubts about the permanence of video tape. That has been bourne out by the experience of Visnews which transferred the old Gaumont, Universal and Paramount newsreel footage on to video tape and found the results much less satisfactory than the original images. The solution recommended by most people in the industry, and certainly by ACTT, which has produced an excellent paper on the subject, is that the images at present on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
nitrate stock should be reproduced on to acetate. That process requires significant resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth pausing for a moment to remember that this stock of film is not just part of our film heritage, but recalls a large amount of our history in the early years of this century. It would be a tragedy to lose that enormous cultural reserve. There are three main holdings of nitrate stock in this country. The largest single holding, by a long way, is that of the British Film Institute in the National Film Archive, which was set up in May 1935 with a duty to maintain a national repository of films of permanent value. It now has a collection of over 75,000 titles, including features and fiction films, shorts, documentaries, newsreels, amateur films and television programmes ranging from 1895 to the present day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the National Film Archive in a moment. The other two major holdings of nitrate film stock are in the Pathe Film Library and the Movietone Library, and it is to those two libraries that the new clause is specifically addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Film Archive might be regarded by the Government as the logical mechanism for ensuring that film held by Movietone and Pathe should be copied and thus preserved. However, the archive is now working overtime to ensure that its existing stock can be preserved. The duplication rate required to preserve its entire stock is some 7 million feet per yard up to the year 2005, and it is clear that its programme of preservation—which is excellent, and much praised by everyone in the industry—is at full stretch. The facilities, let alone the funds, to take on any additional work for stock other than that already held by the archive simply are not three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for my concern, and for the new clause, become clear when we consider what is likely to happen to the stocks held by Pathe and Movietone. The Pathe Library is wholly owned by our old friend Thorn EMI, and is based at EMI's Elstree studios. The original Pathe company was established in 1896, and the library contains a major range of newsreel and magazine material dating from 1896 onwards. The value of that material is widely acknowledged. EMI, indeed, has acknowledged to some extent the need to carry out preservation by setting up a selective preservation programme, with an extra full-time member of staff employed specifically for that purpose. However, in view of the scale of the task and the quantity of footage that needs to be preserved and copied, the achievement will not be possible with EMI's current resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Movietone Library the problem is even more acute, as that library is majority-owned by Twentieth Century Fox, which holds 55 per cent. of the shares. The library rents its premises from Rank Laboratories at Denham, again our old friend Rank comes into the picture. British Movietone News, which started in 1929, continued as a production unit for some years after Pathe. The library contains an estimated 20 million ft. of nitrate film stock, and there is at present no systematic programme for copying and preserving that stock
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those two major libraries—Pathe and Movietone—are substantial holdings of extremely important footage which is deteriorating and which is
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
also highly inflammable. The present arrangements for copying and preserving it are wholly inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong argument for a Government-inspired initiative to give a major incentive to the two companies to copy their film on to acetate and to have a proper programme for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to persuade the Secretary of State to initiate a scheme—perhaps involving a mixture of tax credits and grants—whereby matching pound-for-pound Government funding is provided as an incentive for Movietone and Pathe to carry out the work needed to preserve and copy their stock. Even if the Government cannot go the whole way and devote the funds that I suggest, I hope that they will assure us that they recognise the problem and have specific practical plans to ensure that the nitrate film stock of the two private companies—I have no quarrel with the excellent work done by the National Film Archive—is properly preserved, because it is not just of our film history but of our history as a nation and a people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I comment on the remarks of the hon. Member for Islington., South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), let me declare a further interest. I was once a regular commentator on Pathe Pictorial short films and occasionally worked on "Look at Life". They were perhaps on acetate, but they are getting pretty close to nitrate. Furthermore, as a schoolboy I flirted with instant cremation by helping to project acetate films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I applaud what the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said about the activities of the British Film Institute archive in preserving nitrate. I studied the matter in some detail during the last Parliament and I am delighted that the Government gave the BFI considerably more money to enable it to keep up with its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the subject raised by the bon. Gentleman is not one that I would immediately identify as suitable for Government help. The firms behind Movietone and Pathe have considerable assets, and bearing in mind their collections of marvellous pieces of celluloid dating from 1895 to 1896 and the insatiable need of television, cable satellite, I would advise them to pull up their socks. If they invested a little and employed some staff they would make a very large fortune. One has to think only of the success on television of the Old Charlie Chaplin and other American films to realise that that is the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the interest of the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) in the preservation of stocks. Of course, one likes to see one's performances year after year. The hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) is also lying rotting on tape in those vaults. I should hate to see the day when any of these great memorials to our acting and commentating abilities of yesteryear were lost to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the serious point is that companies do not always realise the value of historic tape. I do not necessarily agree with my hon. Friend's pound-forpound scheme, but we should certainly take on board
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
the spirit of the new clause. Unless the tapes are preserved, they will be lost and there will be no way of recreating them. If the Minister is unable to accept the new clause in its present form, I ask him to give the matter some constructive thought between now and Report, because there is a good point behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cable and all other bodies may use this clause in the future. I hope tht they do. I enjoy Charlie Chaplin films being played over again, although I am not so sure about those mentioned by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes. I have yet to see one, and I shall not criticise what I have not seen. On a more serious note, if they are lost, the nation loses something of its cultural heritage. Therefore we ought to encourage their preservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the closing remarks of the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), although I do not regard them as relating to the Bill. In this respect, I share the views of my hon. Friend the member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is essentially to establish the framework within which the commercial film industry will operate in future. It is not directly concerned with the preservation of past films. Although I realise that there are problems with nitrate film stock, which decays—no doubt other members of the Committee also found most interesting all that the hon. Gentleman said—I question whether this is the appropriate mechanism for dealing with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend Lord Gowrie makes a grant of more than £7 million a year to the British Film Institute, which currently pays about £2 million a year to the National Film Archive for various purposes, including preservation of film. Not only am I becoming ever more enthusiastic about the business expansion scheme, I am becoming ever more enthusiastic about my noble Friend, who seems extremely generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pathe Film Library and the Movietone Library are owned by large bodies and are operated profitably. Therefore, I do not think that it would be appropriate for the Government to seek to introduce a statutory scheme, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) proposed. If we went down the path along which the hon. Gentleman seeks to lead us, it would involve costs of £30 million, and with the 50-50 split suggested, that would be £15 million at 1984 prices. Neither the Department of Trade and Industry nor the Office of Arts and Libraries, which is more directly concerned, have received any request for help from the two companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points arise out of what the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said. Once again, I have to record my disappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strictly speaking, the hon. Gentleman is right in saying that the Bill is primarily about the future of British film rather than its past. However, when confronted with the real, practical problem of film stock which is now deteriorating and which will continue to do so until the year 2000, and, given a vehicle through which something can be done to force the Government into activity, it was right for us to seize
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
upon it as a mechanism for doing so. The Government are not averse to doing the same when they wish to include peripheral matters in Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether specifically the pound-for pound matching contribution which my new clause proposes is the right means of achieving the desired aim is one about which I am open to argument. The two companies make a considerable profit from their holding of these libraries of film, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary may be right in insisting that it is not appropriate for the Government to put in money in the pound-for-pound mechanism which my new clause proposes and achieve the end result by incentives from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that after I had tabled the clause, and thus placed the problem before the Minister, he would come forward with a commitment that the Government would examine the best way of achieving the end product—that is, the preservation of important film stocks, by the year 2000—which surely is what we all want. It should be remembered that the figure mentioned by the Minister, £15 million at 1984 prices, would be spread over 16 years' work in preserving the stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not matter whether the objective is achieved by the specific mechanism that I suggest or by an additional grant to the National Film Archive, so that that body could take over stocks held by Movietone and Pathe and preserve it, or by placing a duty on those companies to do so at their own expense; I wish to ensure that those stocks are preserved. At Pathe, some work is being done on copying the film, but it is not sufficient, whereas no sustained steps seem to have been taken at Movietone in that respect. I hope that the Minister is prepared to tell us that he appreciates the problem and that he will consider ways of achieving the result that we all wish—that the important elements of film stock will be copied and preserved—and say on Report how his discussions and investigations have progressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he hoped that I appreciated the problem, which I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has, perhaps taken a tiny step along the road towards achieving what we wish. However, there is a world of difference between appreciating that a problem exists and wanting to do something about it. I fear from what the Minister has said that his recognition of the problem has not taken him much further than that; certainly, he does not appear to wish to do anything real, serious or practical in terms of ensuring that the film stocks are preserved. Therefore, I must put on record my disappointment. In view of what has been said, it may be that the form of wording embodied in the new clause is not entirely appropriate. Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister will feel able to re-examine the problem, which he appreciates but which he does not seem to want to do anything about at present. I shall keep that faint hope in mind and trust that we may be able to come back later to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that while the Minister said that he appreciates the problem—no doubt that also applies to his officials—it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
would be in our interests to keep the matter under review and to continue to press it? As time goes by, the problem will become more acute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is, of course, correct. One of the major features of the problem is that the longer the time period extends and the later it gets, the more difficult it will be to resolve the problem. The Minister of State said that he was on a learning curve. I hope that he and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will progress along it a little more rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not feel that pressing the new clause to a Division would be the most productive way of resolving the problem, but I intend to press the Minister's appreciation of it much further in the coming months. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments will meet with some disfavour from my hon. Friend the Minister. I suspect, rather gloomily, that there may be some faults in the drafting and that I may be told by my hon. Friend that the amendments are in some way illegal. However, they are nakedly and unashamedly patriotic and nationalistic. If we are to fulfil the needs of the British film industry, we should define a British film narrowly as British. That is the purpose of the amendments. As I understand it, under the Bill as drafted a Frenchman could set up a film, hire a scriptwriter from Australia and actors from Canada, and provided it came within the definition of the Commonwealth and the EEC that film might qualify as a British film. I apologise to my hon. Friend if I am wrong, but many other countries subject to the agreements make sure that our industry cannot participate in their schemes. I hope that my hon. Friend will give the amendments his favourable consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess immediately that I share the somewhat gloomy forebodings of the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) of the Government's response to the amendments. I wish to associate the Opposition with the Government's patriotism in pursuing the amendments. We have in the Bill an example of the way in which our obligations under the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Accession are inappropriate to the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all understand that the Treaty of Rome imposes upon our country and Government an obligation to ensure fair competition in industry throughout the Common Market. However, there is no point in trying to help a Common Market film industry when what is at issue in the Bill is the cultural significance and identity of a British film industry. I know that it is easy to state that fairly obvious point, and I am sure that Ministers will support that. I agree that it does not help them to overcome the difficult legal and treaty obligations that we have undertaken. Nevertheless, in supporting the hon. Gentleman's amendment I draw the attention of the Minister to the example of other Community countries which, perhaps typically, have pursued policies based on robust common sense whereas we have tended stringently to fulfil the obligations that we have undertaken under the law and the treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Germans have quite sensibly and, I repeat, robustly, insisted that there is no point in trying to extend right across the Community the rules to support the EEC film industry when supporting one's own film industry is a matter of cultural identity. Their domestic policy has made it clear that when they support the film industry they mean a German film industry that reflects German values and interests, employs German people and is an expression of German culture.

If Ministers want an escape route in legal terms, I understand that they must place some reliance on article 36 of the treaty which apparently authorises Governments to take measures that would restrict the free circulation of people where the objective is the protection of national treasures of artistic value. In some circumstances, it may stretch the definition of "national treasures" somewhat when one looks at some of the products of the film industry.

	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
Nevertheless, I believe that we may see there the flavour of the sort of argument that I hope would commend itself to Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the French supply a panoply of Government assistance to their film industry and they have not been inhibited or deterred in any sense, for example, by the obligation to extend that range of Government aids to the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have an obligation to the Committee not merely to say, "This is all quite impossible by virtue of the Treaty of Rome." We want to know how it is that other EEC countries are able to direct help towards their film industries and we expect at least as strong support for the British film industry from our Government as is available to that of other EEC countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) by saying that just as a British sausage is different from a German frankfurter, so a British television or film product is different from one that is European. I emphasise what my hon. Friend said. British means British—it does not mean European, and European does not necessarily mean British.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to endorse the comments made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and especially those of my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton). Clearly, it is not the intention of the Bill or the Committee that we, as a nation, should fund a film made by a French-Canadian director through a company registered in Southern Ireland, shot in Spain, once it has successfully gained entry into the Common Market, and using Italian film extras. At present, that is what we appear to be legislating for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great care to the points that were made and especially to those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton), who moved the amendment. I have great sympathy for the intention behind this set of amendments. However, there are important reasons why I must resist them and I cannot be as kind to my hon. Friend as I was when the previous amendment was moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4(1) and (2) set out the requirements for a film to be a British film. The maker of the film must be either a resident of a member state or a company that is registered and whose central management and control is in a member state throughout the making of the film. By contrast, any studio used in making the film must be in a Commonwealth country—which, of course, includes the United Kingdom—or the Republic of Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to feature films, the definition is identical to that which at present applies to the registration of British films under the Films Act 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the United Kingdom entered the European Economic Community, amendments were made by section 8 of the European Communities Act 1972 to extend the definition to include citizens of or companies incorporated in any member state. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
extension was necessary to comply with the obligations imposed on all member states by directives issued by the Council of the EEC requiring the removal of restrictions on the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services in the film industry. However, the requirements in respect of the location of the studios used were not amended by the 1972 Act because the use of national studios is accepted as a justifiable requirement from a cultural point of view and provides the security of skilled labour and the know-how essential to the atmosphere of a film.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in respect of labour costs therefore provide that not less than a stated proportion of the labour costs of making the film, such as, fees, salaries or wages paid to directors, producers, actors, actresses, technicians, and so on, is a necessary requirement. That is to prevent, for example, American labour counting towards the qualifying labour costs of films that could be certified under schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background in which the United Kingdom has demonstrated greater Community spirit than some other member states. To put the clock back some 15 years later, and re-erect the barrier against other member states, would be pointless and futile. Sooner or later—probably sooner—such a provision would be held by the European Court of Justice to be inconsistent with the fundamental right of establishment and the freedom to provide services. Our Community obligations are clear and I must ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 62 is, I believe, a technically correct version of what was intended by amendments Nos. 49 and 50, which were not selected. It would exclude Commonwealth citizens or residents from counting towards eligible British labour costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed amendment No. 60, which relates to Commonwealth studio use and in many ways is linked to the intention behind amendment No. 62. It is worth examining why any concession is made to overseas labour, leaving aside the question of what overseas labour should or should not be allowed. Film makers travel widely to find appropriate locations. They may need deserts, jungles, mountains—with or without snow—swamps and so on. At a previous sitting my hon. Friend the Minister of State referred to the film "Ghandi". It is interesting to note that to capture the atmosphere that film was shot in Delhi, on the same road along which Ghandi's funeral procession passed. Those points are important. The rules have been designed over the years to permit film makers to go overseas for location shooting. However, that concession is not unlimited. The limit for non-United Kingdom labour is 20 per cent., although there is some flexibility in special cases, and for non-United Kingdom studios the limit is 7·5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is flexible and gives film makers a proper degree of freedom to use overseas facilities. However, traditionally it has been part of the concessions to strengthen our economic and cultural ties with the Commonwealth by encouraging British film makers to use Commonwealth countries where possible. The relaxation has not been carte blanche, but a practical solution to the circumstances of film making. We have decided to retain present definitions as far as possible and I see no pressing reason to drop the reference now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Minister and cannot pretend that I was surprised at the response he felt forced to make. He spoke of being unable to put the clock back. However, I do not believe that that is practical either. We are asking him perhaps to stop the clock, as is done in many other countries to ensure that their money does not flow overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend has taken note of what I said, and I hope that it will be considered. It is surely a pity that on relatively small issues of this nature we are steadfastly and enthusiastically pro-European, while on some of the big issues we do not do what we should do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having drawn the amendment to the notice of my hon. Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to. </i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 2 agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>On proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. It is now an academic point, but it has some importance for the future. Earlier in our proceedings, you ruled that my hon. Friend the Minister and I were out of order in referring in coded language to Sir Humphrey and the right hon. James Hacker. The Minister said, in so many words, that he had consulted his officials, and I said, in so many words, that as he had been so helpful in meeting the Committee's wishes, he might well go on to occupy Downing street one day. In effect, you ruled out of order euphemisms about the role of the Civil Service and the rewards to a Minister for meeting the Committee's wishes. In the event—for the future, before it joins the folklore of precedents for Committee Chairmen—I wonder whether you may wish, if not to withdraw your ruling, at least to leave it open-ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that that is not a point of order for me. It was quite charming, and one is delighted that the hon. Member should wish to felicitate the Minister and his officials. One is also delighted that he should wish that, some day, the Minister will change his residence. However, as we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
in this state of euphoria, would it not be polite if he also wished the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) the chance to move house? Nevertheless, I hear what the hon. Member says, and as I have not yet sat down, perhaps it may appear in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> But it was not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I, too, may contribute to the euphoria by thanking you, Sir John, and also, through you, Mr. Crowther, for presiding over the Committee. We have greatly enjoyed our proceedings under both Chairmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also thank all the members of the Committee most sincerely for the interesting speeches and points that have been made. I felt that it has been one of the most interesting Committees that I have ever attended. There has been a lot of give and take—I was going to say on both sides—between the Government and the rest of the Committee. I compared it earlier with the position of a minor Minister in a minority Government. However, I am very grateful to everyone, because everyone has been extremely constructive and we have got a lot out of the Committee. So I thank everyone and you, Sir John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to endorse what the Minister said. We have had a most enjoyable Committee, because it has been animated by a genuine concern for the film industry. At times, the Minister has accepted the concept—perhaps he did not invent it—that he has been on a learning curve. We should all accept that a learning curve is something that one not only ascends but sometimes slips down. We hope that some of the matters that we have discussed will, in due course, produce concrete results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by thanking you, Sir John, and your predecessor, Mr. Crowther, for the way in which you have guided the Committee, because it has contributed a great deal to its good humour and, I hope, to some of its constructive achievements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
