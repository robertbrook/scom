	<p>[MR MICHAEL MORRIS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education (Corporal Punishment) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Mr. Bob Dunn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Education (Corporal Punishment) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
In moving the motion, may I say how pleased the Committee must be to be under your guidance and Chairmanship, Mr. Morris. Even-handedness and fairplay is your hallmark. During the sittings on the Bill we look to proceed in the cheerfulness and amiability which education Bills have begun to attract in recent years. I am sure that all members of the Committee will join me in wishing you a happy reign as it were, over our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Morris. I hope that we need not spend long on the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition made it clear to the Government that if they were willing to meet us in a few respects we could speed up the Committee's proceedings. First, we said that sight of the regulations that will arise from the Bill would be helpful to us. To some extent the Minister has tried to help us. I understand that members of the Committee who collected their post after 12 noon today will have found therein a set of notes on clauses and a copy of the regulations. It would have been much more helpful if we had had a little time to read through the documents and consult others, but it is not too much of a disadvantage. I appreciate that Ministers have great difficulty in persuading civil servants that it should be automatic for us when discussing legislation, to have sight of regulations that will be made under it. Therefore, although we were a little disappointed not to have the documents sooner, the concession is useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the other points on which we hoped that the Minister would meet us, in particular, we would have liked exclusion from corporal punishment for pupils suffering from physical or mental handicaps and for pupils over 16. We would also have liked some agreement about limiting the frequency and extent of corporal punishment and an opt-in rather than an opt-out system. The regulations seem to be a little better—they edge a little more towards our aims than I had expected. I welcome that. We had also hoped that the Minister would make it absolutely clear that local authorities which have already abolished corporal punishment cannot have it reintroduced in their areas because of a decision taken in a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, the Minister has been able to meet us only on the regulations. If the Government could meet us on some of the other points, our deliberations could be speeded up. We have no intention of deliberately delaying the Committee, but if there cannot be abolition of corporal punishment, which is what we believe in, we want a Bill that limits it as far as possible and meets the spirit of the European ruling. I support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clement Freud 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridgeshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also warmly welcome you, Mr. Morris, as Chairman of the Committee. In view of the Minister's contention of cheerfulness and amiability, would you guide us on how long we shall sit on a Wednesday evening? You will know that many important political parties have parliamentary meetings on Wednesday evenings. Although an occasional Wednesday would be supportable, it would be helpful to have an idea of when we would get a break in which to look after our other interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Government, but in view of the experience of the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) on gastronomic matters, I am sure that the Government Whip on duty will take due notice of his requests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Key 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be several Committee members with an interest in education and I should like now to declare mine, so that I need not repeat it later. I have been a teacher for 16 years and am a member of the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association, but when I speak, I do not represent its views, nor have I sought its views on this subject—I shall be speaking entirely for myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Education (Corporal Punishment) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Four o'clock</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we continue, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Committee room. Secondly, I call attention to the fact that adequate notice of amendments should be given and, as a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 60, in Title, line 1,leave out " in respect " and insert "for the abolition ".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be obvious to the Committee that this first group of amendments is designed to produce an abolition Bill rather than the mismatch of a Bill now before us. It was clear on Second Reading that a large majority felt that we should not continue to have corporal punishment in this country and, added to that, a large number said that the Government's Bill was not workable. While some wanted to keep corporal punishment, they felt that the bureaucracy and the invidiousness of treating one pupil differently from another rendered the scheme unworkable. Therefore the Opposition's first group of amendments seek to ascertain whether the Government have actually taken any notice of those views and whether, even at this late date, they might not be prepared to accept that it would be far better to abolish corporal punishment in all our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to repeat the point that I made on Second Reading—that I used to be a teacher and that, sadly, I sometimes used corporal punishment. I regretted that I had to do that on those occasions and I very much regret it now.—[Hon. Members: "Why?"] I do not believe that one can teach effectively in an atmosphere of fear. There is ample evidence that successful teachers and successful schools can manage adequately without any consideration of corporal punishment. If we are trying to teach young people the importance of self-control and self-discipline, it is totally inappropriate—even immoral—to threaten them or to try to coerce them to do something that they cannot be persuaded to do other than by employing violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe that not only is corporal punishment immoral and wrong but that on far too many occasions it has proved actually physically damaging to pupils. There are fairly regular instances of pupils ending up with broken fingers or wounds as a result of corporal punishment, which is unacceptable in an enlightened education world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some pupils subjected to corporal punishment get fairly hardened. They get used to it and some of them achieve a certain measure of notoriety and show bravado because such punishment makes no impact on them. Some youngsters can be damaged even when they are unlikely to be subjected to corporal punishment. If it is threatened, or if they witness teachers using corporal punishment on other children, some children can be damaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Humfrey Malins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to get the trend of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Does
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
he believe it wrong for a parent to smack a child at home in any circumstances? If not, how does he distinguish that from physical punishment at school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be argued that a person is not successful in disciplining a child if he has to smack the child. One should not be proud of having to smack a child. It is not a measure of success. It shows failure and incompetence. Some parents, because of their incompetence, are driven to smacking a child. However, that does not mean that someone trained as a teacher should admit that he is also lacking in competence. I accept that some teachers have occasionally used corporal punishment. I have done so. I admit that it was due to my own incompetence and the situation in which I was placed in the school. However, corporal punishment cannot be justified just because a parent does it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Thorne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the main difference between the punishment of a child by a parent and by a teacher is that the child knows that the parent loves him despite the punishment. That cannot be said about the teacher. That is the major different between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the argument about the loving relationship between the parent and the child and the ease and ability with which the parent can begin the process of forgiveness between himself and the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important at this early stage to establish the premise on which the hon. Gentleman is basing his thinking. The hon. Gentleman implied that corporal punishment at home was a demonstration and manifestation of the failure of parents. Does he believe that that is the only interpretation of corporal punishment at home? If so, I must beg to differ with him most profoundly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should all strongly object to the use of violence. There is no justification for the use of deliberate violence. It is perhaps because the parent has failed in other ways that he is pushed into using violence. The use of violence in all walks of life is evidence of an individual's failure or of society's failure. If we wish to believe that humans have attractions in their characters, we should try to organise society so that we can eliminate violence. I do not see how it can be argued that one sort of violence is wrong while the sort of violence we are talking about is right. We should aim to try to create a society in which violence is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that society is not perfect. Violence is inevitable on occasions. However, I still believe that we should try to create a society where it is unnecessary. I believe that a parent should try in all circumstances to avoid violence, but I accept that however hard parents try not to, they will sometimes lose their tempers or resort to violence. It cannot be said that that is a good thing. It happened because the parent was unable to find an alternative. I do not suggest that parents should act in that way on purpose. Ideally, they should avoid such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the first requirement for parents is to ensure that children behave themselves because they want to. Parents set an example and so, by their arguments and actions, they can try to persuade their children to act in certain ways. Children are then more likely to respect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
their parents and—because they accept their parents' authority—will do what they might prefer not to do. If parents fail in those respects, they may be tempted to coerce children by a slap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, easy to discuss such matters in abstract in Committee. It may be quite different and much harder for an extremely tired parent with a crotchety, small child to live up to that ideal. However, parents should aim for that ideal and not rely on violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could clarify one point because we are in danger of steering in the wrong direction. The real problem is that the Bill establishes several different punishments for exactly the same offence. Does my hon. Friend agree that a parent would create difficulties if he smacked one of his children for an offence but exempted his twin brother—who was guilty of exactly the same offence—because his name was on a household register? Natural justice is at the heart of the problem created by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that argument. I thought that I had made that clear when I outlined why the Government—having secured a majority for the Bill to proceed to Committee—should reconsider it and examine our amendments. Many of those who favour corporal punishment believe that because the Bill could treat children differently it is unacceptable. I hope that my hon. Friend will develop that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring to the emotional damage caused to some children who never receive, or are ever likely to receive, corporal punishment in schools. They become upset, for instance, because a teacher may have said that if a class acts in a certain way, pupils will suffer the strap or the cane. Children can still fairly frequently be heard to say that they do not wish to go to school; that is often because they have been frightened by a general threat to the class from the school system or an individual teacher, even though those particular children are unlikely ever to be subjected to such punishment. I shall not go into detail, but there are many instances of children being disturbed by, for example, a blanket threat that they could be subject to corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many connotations about the damage to individuals' personalities and sexuality by the misuse of caning. We have all seen on bookstalls objectionable publications such as the "Joys of Spanking", "The Art of Caning" and so on. That is perhaps a minor but unfortunate effect of the use of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My strongest argument is that corporal punishment is anti-educational. One may be able to condition people—or animals—with such punishments, but if we want to educate people we should not do it with force of that kind. We should try to create an atmosphere in school where young people want to learn and where they learn one of the most important things—self-discipline. I can see little point in coercing pupils in school until they are 16, if at the end of the day one has not actually taught them anything or instilled into them self-discipline. Therefore, the whole idea of corporal punishment is anti-educational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also counter-productive. There is much evidence to show that in schools where corporal punishment is used a great deal, particularly where it is used excessively, it breeds an atmosphere of violence and it breeds bravado in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
pupils, because they are subjected to corporal punishment and say that it does not hurt. There is nothing more damaging to a school than when corporal punishment is held in contempt. There is quite a lot of evidence to show that pupils from schools which breed violence become violent in later life. I believe that the amount of child abuse—child battering—and abuse between husband and wife is the result of the belief held by some schools that total discipline can be imposed through violence.

My final point is that corporal punishment is unnecessary. It amazes me how many countries in Europe either have never had corporal punishment or abolished it many years ago. No one so far, either on Second Reading or in any of the correspondence that I have seen, has been able to tell us that it is impossible for the schools to operate in Greece, Italy, Iceland, Luxembourg, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, France, Finland, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Norway, Romania, Portugal, Sweden, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, West Germany, Switzerland or even Ireland. All those countries have managed to get rid of corporal punishment; no one has come to me and said that the schools in those countries cannot operate, that education is defective without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those fairly brief introductory remarks, I hope that we can persuade the Government to abandon the convoluted proposals in the rest of the Bill even at this late stage and to turn clause 1 into an abolition Bill, and perhaps finish at an early time at our first sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Flannery 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been against corporal punishment since I was a child, because I went to a school where it was the order of the day. It was very rare to get through a day without counting about six that occurred on most hands in the school. It was unbelievable that anybody could be so silly as to do that. It made me realise that it was so counterproductive to education that as a teacher I never used it, and I found myself very unpopular on occasion in staff rooms when arguing against it on educational grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel sorry for Conservative Members. I think that most of them do not believe in the Bill. I have spoken to some of them, and the fact that they are here, defending the indefensible, is almost alarming, because they do not have the heart for it. On Second Reading some of them made speeches at the end of which their conclusion was the opposite of the feeling expressed in them. I see one Conservative Member smiling in recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is surely the most ridiculous that any of us have seen, even those who have been here for many years. It has so many anomalies. Hon. Members have received documents from many sources. One from the Childrens Legal Centre lists 17 such anomalies, and most reasonable and even unreasonable human beings would agree with its representations. But what is even more important is that from those anomalies further anomalies bristle. The Bill is pregnant with absolute nonsense. It gives birth almost by the second to issues which have nothing whatever to do with education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the Second Reading debate and read the Bill, I cannot but believe that the only answer to this silly piece of legislation is the complete abolition of corporal punishment in schools, which has already happened in most other countries. Corporal punishment lingers in our schools like imperialism. Imperialism is now dying, yet the imperialist countries try to keep a toehold. Similarly, those who want corporal punishment

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in schools cannot face getting rid of it, so we have to mobilise a head of steam to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise that this will be my only intervention. But I suspect the hon. Gentleman will make a lengthy contribution to our deliberations, and I should like him to answer one question now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman started by saying that it was the abuse of an instrument of discipline to which he reacted so strongly. Will he explain the logical process involved in first acknowledging the abuse and then saying that the instrument itself should be abolished? I cannot quite follow that transfer of reasoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman can follow it very clearly and is merely making a debating point. He must understand what I have said because it is so simple—children cannot be terrorised into good education. Any experienced teacher knows that. Sadly, however, oversized classes, too few books and education cuts have led them to resort to that method of ending, if only for a short time, their own frustrations while deepening the education problem which they face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the anomalies to which my hon. Friend has referred are appalling. The vast majority of schools in this country use corporal punishment, although many pretend that they do not, and they violate necessary rules all the time. For instance, corporal punishment should take place in the presence of a witness, and is often administered in the head's room—but not as often as all that. Usually what happens is that a frustrated teacher calls out young Johnny and thrashes him in front of the class. How will that affect the sensitivities of the other children in the class? The result of such a stage act—a teacher beating a small child—is to close the channels of learning that the teacher was trying to open or to keep open, and the essence of the beating is anti-educational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, nearly all such beating go unrecorded, although they go on all the time and have nothing to do with education. I have met people standing at the bar who have said, "It never did me any harm." As I said on Second Reading, one looks at them quizzically and thinks, "Really?". Many of them think that it is manly—like using after-shave lotion—to have been beaten at school. That is utter nonsense. The Government are in an untenable position. Even if they had tried, it would have been difficult for them to think of anything more retrograde and anti-education than this silly Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(1) shows that a teacher beating a pupil in loco parentis is really acting in loco draconis. He will terrify the child. We can see what the Government are frightened of: a teacher losing his temper and beating a child, and then finding that the child is on the exemption list. The Bill will provide exemption on demand. It will create a furore. A teacher will have to know which child is to be beaten and whether perhaps only one parent wishes that and is in conflict with the other parent. The Bill will also excuse staff who beat an exempted pupil from criminal liability. What is the good of that? It will prevent LEAs in England and Wales from abolishing corporal punishment in the schools that they control, and it will allow the retention of corporal punishment in schools that have, for educational reasons and in common humanity, abolished it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I shall not make a long speech. The essence of the Bill can be dealt with quickly because most Conservative Members do not believe in it, and certainly the Opposition do not. If we do not waste time, the Bill can be enacted quickly and will put all teachers in the most difficult and anomalous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to institutionalise rule by fear, with certain exemptions. Punishment is usually administered with other children watching. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) made an important point. Many of the children will never receive corporal punishment. Many are timid and sensitive, yet they have to watch a brutal and silly act. So many of them, who will do everything in their power not to do anything to justify being punished, will be terrorised by what they see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many adults think that a good smack is all right. But it is quite different from an adult seizing a stick and beating a child. It is not like the little get-along used by parents. There is an indignity in a child sticking out his hand, or another part of his anatomy, to be beaten. No one can believe that that is in the child's educational interest. It sets an appalling example to children. It tells teachers that they can beat people into submission, and that they can get what they want if they terrorise people. It is organised beating. One thing worse than an individual losing his temper and striking another person is organising for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is bristling with unfairness and anomalies and it will produce endless problems. It is not only unfair, unjust and silly, it is totally unworkable. Unless it is abandoned, as it should be, it will produce such problems that teachers will have to ask the Government to withdraw it because it cannot work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not surprisingly, the two Opposition Members who have spoken have been sweeping in their condemnation of the Bill and in their promotion of the amendments. However, they are utterly wrong if they suppose that no Conservative Members support the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the clauses, the Committee must consider, first whether corporal punishment is in itself unacceptable and, secondly whether the decision of the European Court has changed matters. I say "No" to the first. It is appropriate in a few cases, and the fact that it is abused on occasion is not a compelling argument for imposing an abolition on schools. I believe that in a few cases it is a proper and residual power for the schools to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point—whether the European Court's decision will distort that conclusion—is more troubling. When I first considered the Bill, I concluded that it would, and that it gave rise to so many anomalies that the Bill could not be supported and that we should go for a wholehearted policy of abolition. However that was just my initial conclusion. I do see that where some children are exempted and some are not anomalies will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I reflected further on the proposals and, in particular, considered the terms of the Bill. I noticed that the ultimate decision for secondary schools is left to the governing body, and I believe that in the end that is where it should rest. If the ultimate decision is left to the governing body because a school chooses not to have a register, it cannot have corporal punishment. Decisions on discipline are best left to the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not wholly disagree with the criticisms of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Opposition Members, and though I believe that anomalies will arise on occasions, I conclude that in most schools in most circumstances the ultimate decision should rest with the governing bodies. For that reason I shall be supporting the Bill and voting against the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to consider whether the governing bodies should be totally sovereign. One or two local authorities have abolished corporal punishment, but they have recognised that that may cause extra problems for teachers and agreed to increase staffing to take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local authority has decided that it does not want corporal punishment in schools and is prepared to provide extra teachers to compensate, it would be unfortunate if a governing body were to say that it wanted to reverse the policy of that authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of leaving the decision to governing bodies. Clearly we can choose a number of authorities to make the ultimate decision. We can say that the ultimate decision should be made by central Government—the view of the Opposition—or that the ultimate decision should be made by the LEA for the particular area. That is a respectable stance to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively we can say that the ultimate decision should be made by the governing body of particular schools. I am totally opposed to the ultimate decision being made by Whitehall. I am surprised to hear hon. Members advocating that, as they have been going on for so long at such length in favour of local authorities and their attendant powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that with his legal mind the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the Bill is not about leaving the decision to governing body. It is about preserving one particular form of discipline—corporal punishment. Surely he would accept that the argument is not about the maintenance of discipline but about the form of punishment that could be administered. The Committee should not take away from governing bodies the responsibility for discipline but the option of corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not affected the argument at all. The question is whether corporal punishment should be an option in a particular school. I believe that it should, but whether it should be capable of being an option or being carried out in the school is a matter for the governing body. I said that there were three authorities where the decision could rest: central Government, which I regard as unacceptable; the LEAs, which I am not against in principle and think would be a respectable option; and the governing bodies of schools, which I think are best qualified to judge the needs of particular schools. I shall support the Bill not because I am in favour of wholesale corporal punishment—I tend to be agnostic about that—but because I believe that the governing bodies should make such decisions. I shall oppose the Opposition amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare my interest. For many years I, too, was a teacher. However, I speak not for any teachers' organisation but entirely on my own behalf. I taught in many inner city schools and I stopped using
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
corporal punishment because I found that it did not work. However it is not for me to lecture about whether or not there should be corporal punishment. I tend to argue much more on the justice of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago in the British Army the cat-o'-nine tails was the regular form of punishment to discipline troops. However, when the Secretary of State for Defence, complete with flak jacket, led his troops in that valiant action at Molesworth, I did not see that he was using any whips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has to remember that under the Bill, the boys in state schools would be subject to corporal punishment, whereas boys in Army schools would not. That is a relevant point. However, we now have no choice but to implement the decision of the Court of Human Rights. If we had stayed out of the Common Market, one would not be in that difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the Court of Human Rights has nothing to do with the Common Market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. However, there is no dispute that we must now carry out the decision that has been made. What we are arguing about is how that decision is being interpreted by the Government. Although I should like corporal punishment to be abolished, the argument about whether it should exist is a red herring. Will the Bill create an apartheid among children? They may be guilty of the same offence but will have different punishments. Children have a very keen sense of natural justice, and we must remember that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Lightbown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Staffordshire, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the comments which I have heard to date on that particular point relate specifically to the injustice of corporal punishment. By saying that, we take away the discretionary powers and common sense of teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am totally opposed to all the emotive talk about beating. As a former chairman of an LEA, my knowledge of corporal punishment in schools is quite extensive. To me, it is the ultimate deterrent and not something that is handed out without considerable thought. It is always administered by a head of department or a head teacher. If two children are involved in the same offence, with one on the register and one not, clearly the head teacher will choose a punishment appropriate to both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. A teacher wants a form of punishment that does not involve a great deal of bureaucracy; after all, corporal punishment is immediate and swift. But now teachers will have to check registers. The child will be kept waiting, with the sword of Damocles hanging over him. It may be argued that a hard-pressed teacher—it should be remembered that education cuts have been imposed by the Conservative Government—will sometimes have to administer what punishment he can. It is easy to see that different punishments may well be applied for the same offence. Children will be divided between those with articulate and inarticulate parents, or with caring and non-caring parents, or by one school against another or one area against another. That will create indiscipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the definition of discipline? It is the creation of a working relationship in which a child learns and a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
teacher teaches. But under the Bill there will be a system of apartheid, with a feeling of discrimination and unfairness not only by pupils, but by teachers and parents. That is no way to create citizens of the future. Recent court cases show that people of this country have a strong faith in natural justice; it is necessary to create a working relationship. The Secretary of State for Education is an intelligent and nice man, but unfortunately not very strong. I believe that he is extremely unhappy with the sort of legislation that he has to put before the House. The Labour party will help him out of his difficulty, provided that he agrees to our proceeding on a non-corporal punishment basis. In that way, we can greatly reduce the Committee's sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a very telling point when he spoke about two children who had committed an identical offence, and one was smacked by his parents while the other was not. That is the real problem of the Bill—the dual system. In many ways, the contention that corporal punishment should be completely abolished is more defensible than saying that there should be two systems in one school. I cannot support the argument that we should abolish it altogether, but, in effect, it is a better argument than that which says we should treat two children who have committed the same offence entirely differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of corporal punishment is fairly emotive and we shall be apt to be carried away if we use words and phrases such as "cat-o'-nine-tails", "beating" and "heavy physical punishment", because corporal punishment in schools or at home does not often lead to those extents. However, I am sure that we are all united in deploring that cat-o'-nine-tails and birching. Such things upset me enormously, as does any form of corporal punishment which is taken too far. We could all relate stories from our own lives that support or go against the argument for corporal punishment, and I ask the Committee to forgive me for telling two very brief stories, both of which are powerful arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a school that I know, in the early 1960s, not only the masters but the senior boys were allowed to impose corporal punishment, that is, to beat other boys. The system worked reasonably well, by and large, but I remember that there was a boy of 14 to whom and 18 year-old senior boy, who was entitled to beat him, took a dislike. He thought that the 14 year-old was perpetually lying and being a nuisance, and he would beat him with a stick, to my certain knowledge, once a week. It transpired that the 14 year-old sold to a local bookshop his only asset of any value—the Bible that his parents had given him on his confirmation—to obtain money to buy sufficient aspirin to kill himself. He duly took the aspirin but he did not die.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one tells that story, everybody who hears it will say, quite rightly, "It's a disgrace. A system that enables a sadistic 18 year-old boy to impose such punishment on a child of 14 is wrong." I believe that we would all react in the same way to that story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second story relates to a large comprehensive school in south London of which I was once a governor and my appointment was political. I have never been in favour of political appointees to governorships because I knew nothing much about the school before I got there and did not contribute as much to it as I should, but I was appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A boy committed the serious offence of thumping a
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
member of staff, the governors took a decision to suspend him and his mother appealed against it. She came before the governors and a discussion took place in which the mother said, "My son has behaved very badly indeed, but, for goodness sake, don't suspend him because he will be out of school for four or five weeks at least. The next thing is that he will be put into a very bad school somewhere and his whole education will suffer." Very foolishly, I said to the governors, "That seems a fair point of view. Cannot he be given six of the best in front of the whole school and the matter forgotten?" The attitude of some of the governors was that corporal punishment was wrong and immoral and that we must not inflict it in 1981 or whenever it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mother said, "Please do that. The boy will learn his lesson and can stay at this excellent school". The end result was that because the governors would not allow him to be beaten he was suspended. He spent five or six weeks out of school, went to another that was not as good, his mother and father were desperately unhappy and his education suffered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps that story gives a slightly different slant to the argument. I would be wrong were I to say that I am against corporal punishment because I believe that it can be useful if used sensibly—perhaps that is the point—by masters and staff. However, the old system that permitted boys to beat boys is not sensible and I am against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must face the problems that were mentioned by many hon. Members on Second Reading. If there is one school, and two boys who enter it through the same door on the same day are subject to different regimes, that cannot be good. There are private schools in which there are assisted places, and I understand that the parents of such pupils in such places can opt them out. Is that helpful? I know of a private school in which the headmaster intends to write to the parents of each boy in an assisted place to say, "You are entitled to opt your boy out of corporal punishment. Generally, the alternative to corporal punishment is expulsion. Please let me hear from you". How sensible will that be in practice? Not many of those parents will follow the opting-out system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have noticed that there are some later amendments which seek to achieve that purpose. He should consider supporting an amendment that would not allow teachers to blackmail parents into making a decision on the basis of whether the child would be allowed to remain in the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. "Blackmail" is a strong word and it may be simply a statement of intent. Beating in schools is usually reserved for serious offences, and the only alternative to corporal punishment is often expulsion or suspension. The hon. Gentleman said earlier that corporal punishment was an admission of failure. That argument is difficult to follow and I do not believe I have come across a parent who would say that smacking a child is an admission of failure. Will not suspension have the same effect as corporal punishment? Will not there be more and more suspensions and expulsions, and are not they much more admissions of failure than corporal punishment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have yet to be convinced that schools which do not use corporal punishment produce better 0 and A-level results than other schools. There is very little proof either way. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
am not convinced by the argument that a number of European countries have abolished corporal punishment. New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Singapore are four relatively civilised countries where corporal punishment is, I believe, retained. The argument that other European countries have abolished corporal punishment does not take us very far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall be forgiven for voting against the amendment because I support corporal punishment when used sensibly. However, I see the consistency of the argument for abolishing it altogether rather than having a two-tier system. That is my dilemma and I believe that many members of the Committee share it, as Opposition Members have recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments because, like other Labour Members, I am an abolitionist with regard to corporal punishment. I am surprised that Conservative Members who, according to the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg), support the Bill have not attempted to put forward some proof of some of the underlying suppositions inherent in their case. For example, is corporal punishment per se harmful? There has been no presentation of an argument from Conservative Members that would refute the suggestion that it is harmful. Is corporal punishment of value to teachers? There are teachers on both sides of the Committee and there are obviously differences of opinion in that respect. Does corporal punishment assist the maintenance of discipline in schools or make it more difficult? Again, there has been no attempt to establish that. However, the assumption is that the onus of proof is on the Opposition to prove that it is harmful, does not contribute to discipline, and that teachers who use it find it difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is being very unfair to Conservative Members. We are saying that the decision should be made by the governing body of each school. The governing body of a school, which represents in part the teachers in that school and will be very close to them, will make the decision in accordance with the needs of that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so we should be discussing a Bill that contains one clause—I am sure that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what clause 2(2) in effect states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the rest of the Bill say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing amendment No. 1 and I shall be grateful if hon. Members will stick to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Morris. On the basis of experience, I contend that there is nothing about corporal punishment which suggests that it achieves any of the effects that some hon. Members appear to believe. I made this point on Second Reading. Looking around schools and examining punishment books personally, I found
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that a picture emerged, which was that the same pupils were punished, and tended to be punished, repeatedly. I do not say that it happened every day, but the names in the book were the same names over a year or two. Joe Bloggs' or John Smith's name was there frequently. He was someone who misbehaved and did not give tuppence about the fact that he paid for it in the end. In fact, within his classroom peer group he became a hero because he could cope with the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hubbard-Miles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a wide choice of punishments, of which corporal punishment might be the kindest, and better than being told "You will not play in the rugby team next Friday as a punishment"? A pupil might prefer corporal punishment. Is not it therefore only a question of choosing punishments. Corporal punishment is not the most severe punishment that can be inflicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that we could introduce thumbscrews, but no one would seriously suggest that we should. We are discussing the fairly well-accepted forms of punishment—the cane, the strap or the slap. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that if there were alternatives some teachers might use them. But they do not, in my opinion, come within the definition of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we are tending to ignore factors outside school which determine a child's behaviour. I can recall a constrasting situation which emerged during one examination that I made when, like the hon. Gentleman, I served on a local education authority. In a city centre school in the Scotland Exchange area, Liverpool, 3, which for obvious reasons I shall not name—this is an area which has all the problems of poor housing and deprivation and bad social conditions that one could imagine—the punishment book was much more detailed and showed far more activity that the punishment book in a school in Liverpool, 18, which as the district number suggests, is an area of extremely good housing, better social conditions generally and better opportunities for a child within its home environment, because of standards there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is a fact that family strains have an effect upon a child which the child can unknowingly take with him to school and fail to respond in the way in which a teacher might expect, and the child is then punished for his lack of conformity in certain circumstances. All these factors support the notion that if we are going to do anything about the problem—which is what the Bill attempts to do—it should be done by way of abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept fully the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Mr. Young) about the two systems, but it is so absurd that I have not addressed myself to it. The idea of a class of 30 children, of whom 17 are not to be punished while the remaining 13 are, with a teacher checking up as and when problems arise, is a total absurdity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised when the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State addressed a pleasant letter to us when sending this material. His name did not immediately ring a bell, and I thought that he must be someone with considerably more intelligence than there is in the Bill. Perhaps the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will reveal to the Committee what he really feels about it. It is nonsense and it ought to be amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

So I have some painful memories, which inspire me to oppose corporal punishment.

I want to make one or two general points before speaking to the Scottish aspect of amendments Nos. 38, 39, 45 and 50, all of which deal with clause 4, which in turn deals with the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. However, I want first to make the point to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland that, while the English and Welsh regulations are with the Committee, I have not seen any sign yet of the Scottish regulations dealing with this matter. I hope that the Scottish Office will take rapid steps to correct that omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg). I have an in-built feeling about lawyers. They spend half their time arguing against themselves and other half arguing with their client. The half of his time that the hon. Gentleman spent in Committee today he spent arguing against himself. We are not talking about the ability of governors to decide the question of discipline but about the form that that discipline should take. It surprises me that Conservative Members—I shall come to the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Hubbard-Miles) and his interesting intervention in a minute—appear to be arguing that the one form of discipline that should be enshrined in legislation—this is the only form that will be—is the ability of teachers to strap or cane a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not really understand the position. If corporal punishment is to be lawful at all, it has to be dealt with by way of legislation, partly because of the effect of the decision of the European Court and partly because, unless a defence is afforded either at common law or by statute, it would be an assault, which is a criminal offence. Therefore, we have to deal with corporal punishment by way of statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill in effect only gives governing bodies the ability to provide for corporal punishment in their school. It does not prevent them introducing other forms of punishment, nor does it compel them to introduce corporal punishment. It merely enables them to make the appropriate decision, with an option of corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had not given way, that lecture could have come from me, because I was about to come to my understanding of why corporal punishment is being enshrined in legislation. I fully understand that if an adult beats, straps or canes a child and that is not enshrined in legislation, technically, in the eyes of the law, it is an assault. I understand the reasons for it, but if someone had told me 14 years ago when I came to the House that in 1985 I would be involved in discussions in Committee to preserve corporal punishment in schools I would have looked at him in disbelief. I would have laughed in his face—but I would have been wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are in 1985 seeking to preserve something that now has no useful purpose—if ever it did, which is questionable. I am sure that the Minister himself, in his heart of hearts, will accept that it has no useful purpose,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
particularly in Scotland—I shall come to that in a moment—yet here we are seeking to enshrine in legislation corporal punishment in our schools in perpetuity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend, in an interesting intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Thorne), said that some boys prefer the strap to being left out of the rugby 15 on a Saturday or the soccer 11 on a Wednesday night. I understand that at rugby-playing schools the boys who play football have to do so during the week while the rugby players play on a Saturday. This may come as a surprise to the hon. Member but if leaving boys out of the rugby 15 or the soccer 11 or leaving girls out of the hockey team is a way to preserve discipline in a school, I am 110 per cent. in favour of it. There is a far stronger case in the example that the hon. Gentleman gave to my hon. Friend for withdrawing the right to strap or cane children. If the hon. Member for Bridgend believes that it is a much better way to preserve discipline in a school that is exactly what we should be doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hubbard-Miles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that the possible psychological effect of withdrawal of the facility of playing rugby was greater than the psychological effect of a smack across the bottom. I speak as a parent of five children and I have only once smacked one of them, but I suspect that there were punishments which they would have preferred I did not give them, that they would have preferred corporal punishment because they felt that that at least was a step taken on the spur of the moment for one specific purpose which did not in any way prejudice the relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To revert to another sport, the hon. Gentleman realises that he is skating on rather thin ice. He is suggesting that children, in the home or in the school, should be allowed to accept an instant punishment in order to forget it. I understand his point, that they will have forgotten having their bottoms smacked or hands strapped on a Wednesday by the time they play in the rugby team on a Saturday. That is not a good argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I take the other point seriously. If leaving pupils out of pupil activities is a good alternative way of maintaining discipline successfully, I—and I speak only personally—would strongly support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the child was suspended from school as opposed to receiving corporal punishment, would he take the same view? That is another option, which has been suggested by many very knowledgeable people in the education system as the ultimate only alternative to corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I leave the question of sport, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. Hughes) has just reminded me that we could punish children by making them play for their school team as some school teams are inclined to be of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in Scotland the option mentioned by the hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-East (Mr. Lightbown), and I have supported schools which have suspended children. The Minister could easily relate the most recent incident in Scotland, where a girl was suspended from a school that I shall not name—it would be so obvious—for a number of weeks. This was not in my constituency so I shall not provide details. I am led to believe that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
ultimate solution was to transfer that pupil to another school. That is an option in Scotland and it is one that I, too, support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these cases are analysed it is not a question of discipline or indiscipline, but of personality conflicts when the teacher and pupil cannot get on. In that case it is in the best interests of the pupil, teacher and parents that the pupil should go to another school. That is especially true since the Government introduced parental choice. When I have had to deal with a case of a disruptive pupil in my constituency, I have always supported the 99.9 per cent. of pupils and parents who conform. I support disciplinary action and I believe that disruptive pupils should be suspended from school. However, I draw the line at corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham has left the Committee, but I do not make much of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is astonishing that we are dealing with legislation that seeks to preserve corporal punishment. I suspect that the Minister and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will argue at Scottish Question time that the pupil teacher ratio in Scottish and all United Kingdom schools is lower than it has ever been. There are about 21 or 22 children per class in Scotland. I do not suspect that the numbers are higher than that in many schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government can boast about that, we have a golden opportunity. We shall never get another opportunity like it. Evidence from the Registrar General shows that the birth rate is increasing. In three or four years, class sizes will increase. Also, class sizes are bound to increase because the Government are reducing the number of teachers. If corporal punishment is to be banned, now is the time to do it because we shall not get another opportunity. I shall not say that teachers now work in a more relaxed atmosphere. If I did, I should get a million letters tomorrow telling me that that was untrue. However, teachers have a better opportunity to adjust if corporal punishment is banned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of clause 4 dealing with Scotland is absolutely ludicrous. I am aware that that the two junior Ministers and the Whip have been sent along to Committee to get the Bill through. I have never seen such a waste of Government time. I do not know what the Chancellor thinks about it. I do not believe that he knows that the Bill is in Committee. I wonder whether he knows what expense it will incur. If the Chancellor wishes to reduce the PSBR he can save a few pounds if the Minister says that he sees the sense of our argument, withdraws the Bill and consigns to to the bin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with less than 10 per cent. of the Scottish pupil population, as 92 per cent. of the pupil population are already exempt from corporal punishment. We have this panoply of legislation and regulations and the code of conduct for parents to opt in or opt out. One twin will be belted and the other will not. I have never seen such rubbish. For the first time in years, I feel sorry for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does my hon. Friend credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that I am a mild mannered man at the best of times. Out of the 10 per cent. of the Scottish pupil population only a small proportion will be subjected to corporal punishment. This is my
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
commercial and I shall not go beyond it, Mr. Morris. I plead with hon. Members to understand what we are discussing. When we reach clause 4, I hope that I can inspire the Conservative Members to knock some sense into the heads of Scottish Office Ministers and persuade them to delete the clause. Less than 1 per cent. of Scottish pupils will at any time be subjected to corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do hon. Members really believe that the legislation is necessary? Surely we could tell the regional education authorities in Scotland—only one is affected in practice—"That is the end of the matter. We shall have no more of this nonsense. It is finished." Why not do that instead of having a panoply of legislation with complicated clauses which the Minister must explain and defend—defending the indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when we reach clause 4 I can persuade hon. Members to give me a wee bit of help. If they do, I shall remember them with eternal gratitude. Indeed, the day will come when the Labour party is in power and there may be a few knighthoods going. I know that they are attractive bait to hon. Gentlemen. It seems that there are now more nights—perhaps I should say knights—than days in the House of Commons. However, I do not wish to bribe Conservative Members, but to persuade them by the sense and wisdom of my arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well persuaded by the argument that as the vast majority of regions in Scotland have abolished corporal punishment we appear to be dealing only with the remaining regions. I read carefully the part of the Bill which relates to England, but did not examine as closely the part relating to Scotland. I am worried about whether it is possible for a governing body—in a region in Scotland where corporal punishment has been abolished—to reintroduce such punishment. That is the fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear the worst in that respect. I suspect that my hon. Friend is right and that the Bill could be a vehicle for extending corporal punishment; it might not contain it to 10 per cent. of the pupil population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us assume that the hon. Gentleman is right—I have no doubt that he is. However, if a local authority has the power and wishes to reintroduce corporal punishment, what is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most local authorities have abolished corporal punishment because they have the power to do so. I do not make a party political point here by saying that most regional authorities are Labour-controlled. However, as regards education, the Scottish regional authorities are fairly forward looking. That is perhaps why the vast majority of them have abolished corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried by the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). The political complexion or attitude of mind might change in local authorities which have abolished corporal punishment and clause 4 might enable them to reintroduce that punishment. That, of course, would be a step backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 38 is very important and refers to when corporal punishment is administered and a civil or criminal action arises. The amendment would ensure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that, in the event of such civil or criminal proceedings, the mere fact that the teacher had the authority to administer or to order the administration of corporal punishment is not in itself a defence for the corporal punishment being administered or its effect. I shall clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mere fact that under the legislation a teacher had the right either to administer or to order the administering of corporal punishment should not be a defence in any civil or criminal proceedings arising from that punishment. I hope that that important point will not be lost on the Minister. I am sure that after giving the matter some thought he will realise what could happen if in a civil or criminal court a teacher could claim as his defence that the legislation enshrined his authority to administer corporal punishment so that if the court found that he had acted within the legislation that would be the end of the matter. The court proceedings ought to be able to progress beyond that. Such a defence should not be accepted in cases such as those I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I freely admit that amendments Nos. 39, 45 and 50 would negate the effects of clause 4. If those three amendments were accepted, clause 4 would be rendered ineffective. I have no wish to hide that from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have spoken only briefly—and bearing in mind my difficulty with my twin brother—I hope that if Ministers do not see the sense of what we are saying Conservative Members will make them do so and that in a few minutes the Bill's passage will be ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to open my remarks by disappointing the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing). I fear that his expectation will not be fulfilled, but I was grateful for his expression of sympathy at the beginning of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science will seek to speak on the more general points made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East and others. I shall confine myself to the Scottish aspects and to the comments of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. I believe that the hon. Gentleman will accept that several of the amendments to which he referred have direct English equivalents. For example, amendment No. 38 is directly equivalent to amendment No. 1
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Scotland differs vastly from that in England and Wales. The general policy since 1968 has been to work towards the ultimate abolition of corporal punishment in Scotland and the hon. Member for Falkirk, East was right to say that the provisions of the Bill would apply only to about 10 per cent. of Scottish pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can it be reintroduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that. I will first set out the position in Scotland. Grampian and Shetland still have to reach a final decision on phasing out. Tayside and the Western Isles intend to retain the sanction of corporal punishment in secondary schools in restricted areas. Only the Borders region has taken no steps towards abolition of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could have simply said, "We have had this ultimate objective for some time and we now impose it on all Scottish education authorities." That was a possible option. However, for the reasons spelt out by
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science on Second Reading that option would not be sensible in Scotland. The general policy of working towards the ultimate abolition of corporal punishment is clear, but I believe that it is sensible for the timetable to be left to individual education authorities. That is also the view of the education authorities. The Bill has not created great controversy in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely my point. Clause 4 is seen as such an irrelevance that it has not provoked controversy. Why not take the opportunity provided by this period of tranquility in Scotland—corporal punishment is not controversial simply because it is never used—to get rid of corporal punishment altogether?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it would have been controversial if we had imposed abolition against their wishes on authorities which have not yet decided on a timetable for abolition. It is much more sensible to ask authorities to consult teachers and parents locally on the provisions in particular areas. That is the essential difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East asked me about the regulations. Again, the position has differed considerably north and south of the border. In England and Wales, the Department of Education and Science issued a consultation paper to determine how to comply with the court's judgment. In Scotland, authorities were working towards voluntary abolition. There was therefore no need to issue any consultation paper. However, we are consulting COSLA on the detailed regulations and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that they will probably be on the same lines as the English ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Bill permits an authority to reintroduce corporal punishment is theoretically arguable, but the trend throughout Scotland has been towards voluntary abolition. I know of no authority which has abolished corporal punishment but now wishes to reconsider its position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept one of the later amendments which would make it impossible for any authority to go back on that? As he seems to believe firmly in phasing out corporal punishment, would it not be logical to provide that where it has been abolished there are no grounds for reintroducing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe in a voluntary policy in Scotland. I should have thought that the Opposition would applaud those sentiments on the part of education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that if he were minded to accept the hon. Gentleman's suggestion he would have some difficulty in persuading his hon. Friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. The voluntary policy is widely accepted in Scotland and seems to me perfectly reasonable. The alternative is to force abolition on education authorities in Scotland. I hope that hon. Members will resist the relevant amendments, particularly amendment No. 45 which goes to the heart of that proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enjoyed the debate on the amendments, especially the exchanges between my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Hubbard-Miles) and the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing). Perhaps I was in the minority, but when I was at school if I had been given the choice of receiving corporal punishment or playing rugby the last thing that I would have chosen would have been to play rugby. I was one of the few who did their best to evade the rigours of the games field. I have avoided similar rigours ever since and hope that I shall do so for the rest of my life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a wide debate on the amendments. The key purpose of the amendments is to achieve abolition and to prevent us from carrying out the proposal that we outlined on Second Reading to allow exemption and the registration of pupils accordingly. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) said that he would like an abolition Bill. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Durham, North (Mr. Radice) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I warn the Secretary of State that we shall try to amend the Bill to make it an abolition rather than an exemption Bill".</p></blockquote>
Earlier, there had been a defiant suggestion that there would be an attempt to prevent the Bill moving into Committee, but the hon. Member for Durham, North said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Secondly, there is the deliberation that the Bill will receive in Committee."—[Official Report, 28 January 1985; Vol. 72, c.53.]</p></blockquote>
Like my hon. Friend the Parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Scotland, I cannot give the hon. Member for Falkirk, East the undertaking that he would like—that we shall have a blinding flash on the road to Damascus and say that the Bill is wrong. We firmly believe it to be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish took us on a Cook's tour of his views on European habits and the habits of the bookstall. I have never heard of some of the titles that he mentioned. However, I dare say that by our third or fourth sitting he will produce evidence so that we can see precisely what he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In camera, of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In camera, or in public, I think that the camera was probably overused in the context of the titles to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery), whom Conservative Members regard as a regimental mascot, did not disappoint us in the range, richness and variety of his English in defining his total opposition to the Bill. However, I assure him that we shall not succumb to his blandishments and join him in making this an abolition Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I firmly believe that where local education authorities seek to permit the application of corporal punishment in schools whose governors wish to maintain a register, parents should have the right to exempt their children. If just one school wishes to apply corporal punishment, it must have the right to do so. That is the fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham said, he is opposed to Whitehall deciding this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are right to point out the difference between European countries and other countries. However, I remind the Committee that in the main, English-speaking countries retain the sanction of
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
corporal punishment. European countries, both east and west, do not allow its use and it is banned in China, the USSR and Japan. But their education systems are different from ours. Our teachers are more actively involved in helping pupils to develop high and improving standards of behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham mentioned the sovereignty of the governing bodies in this matter. The governing body would have to decide whether to set up a register. Without a resolution from that body, no register could be maintained. It would be unnecessary to have annual repeal or discussion of that resolution. The policy of the school, as affirmed by the governing body, must be set out in the school brochure as required by the Education Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish gave examples of children being physically hurt by corporal punishment. He mentioned broken fingers. Of course we are talking about reasonable and moderate corporal punishment. The Government would not support unreasonable or immoderate punishment of any sort. But if it did take place, it would be a matter for the courts, criminal or civil, and the existing law of the land would cover that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes argued that corporal punishment is a sanction of last resort and that if it cannot be used another perhaps more dramatic sanction must be found. On Second Reading some of my hon. Friends raised the question of suspension. Suspension is being used more often with the result that many children who ought to be in school are not there and society and the community suffer, as do the parents who have to maintain discipline at home. As a result, the children's response to school deteriorates and truancy may result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall that we tried to persuade the Government that they should have taken the Bill through the Special Standing Committee procedure so that we could have a wider discussion on the alternatives to corporal punishment. It is unfortunate that we are now forced to deal with one form of sanction in isolation and cannot discuss how to improve discipline in schools in general. There is probably more of a case for us to spend time considering how some local authorities use suspensions inefficiently so that pupils remain outside school, rather than spend so much time on corporal punishment, when we have heard that it is virtually extinct in Scotland. We need a full debate on the alternatives to corporal punishment, taking into consideration how to introduce good discipline so that few sanctions are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the prerogative of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish to raise that point. He knows that the request was not met. He can seek to raise the matter on the Floor of the House at a time suitable to him. If he wishes to raise the subject, I hope that he has a fair wind to enable him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between Opposition Members and ourselves is that they are abolitionists. Although some of my hon. Friends may not always walk in step with me in our deliberations, they support the Bill, albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm. I hope that the more we deliberate the more they will realise how attractive and sensible the Bill is in its provision and application, and that those who are agnostic will become more zealous in their support of our views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The amendments are interesting, but perhaps also pernicious in that they would bring about abolition. Amendment No. 1 would expose teachers to civil and criminal proceedings in cases of corporal punishment without the benefit of the in loco parentis defence. In effect, it would mean the enforced abolition of corporal punishment in education. The Committee must be clear that that is what it would do. The Committee will appreciate that the Bill's main purpose is to provide an exemption scheme, a point made abundantly clear both in the Bill and on Second Reading. The Government remain opposed to enforced abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would leave out subsection (3) which would prevent a teacher from using the in loco parentis defence if a battery involving an element of punishment were to be used on an exempt pupil to protect persons or property from immediate danger. It would also leave out subsection (4) which would mean that a teacher might be the subject of criminal proceedings because of a contravention of exemption arrangements. It would also leave out subsection (5), which would leave clause 2 effectively without a definition of who would be exempt from corporal punishment. In the light of that, I hope that the amendment will not be pressed. Subsection (5) defines an exemption. It is fundamentally related to clause 2, and the Bill is meaningless without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 relates to clause 3 which tidies up a number of issues for the convenience of those who have to operate an exemption scheme. Without subsections (1) to (3) there will be uncertainty about the definition of a responsible body, the procedures for providing register extracts in legal proceedings and the service of notices, such as the forms which parents will sign. Subsection (4) gives the Secretary of State the necessary power to withdraw an assisted place participation agreement if a school in the assisted places scheme flouts the regulations. Other amendments are mechanical consequences of amendment No. 33.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 is a straight attempt to force the abolition of corporal punishment. As I said before, the Government and I are against such an approach, as I believe are the majority of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 seeks to change the Bill's title by leaving out "in respect" and inserting "for the abolition" . The title would the not reflect the contents of the Bill. As the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish with his considerable knowledge of the workings of the House knows, it would then be virtually impossible to steer the Bill through its remaining stages in the Commons and the other place. The amendment is consequential to a call for abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not and, in our view, should not be about the abolition of corporal punishment. It provides a scheme allowing individual parents to exempt their children from corporal punishment. Some people may want this to be an abolition Bill, but on Second Reading it was clear that the House did not want that. Therefore, I urge that the amendments be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Andrew F.Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Government might move on this subject.Since Second Reading.I do not imagine that they have received a single communication in favour of their proposals, and I suspect that they have received a considerable number setting out the inconsistencies and problems for
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
educationalists which the legislation will produce. We had vainly hoped that the Government would see the light and become abolitionists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set out all the arguments and we firmly believe that what we ought to have is an abolition Bill. However, the Opposition have a slight problem. Your selection has enabled the Committee to have a very effective debate on this group of amendments, Mr. Morris, but it is not easy to select from the group amendments to put to the vote which set out the abolitionist principle. Will you allow the Committee to have a vote on new clause 6 when we reach it? I think that that would give the Opposition the best opportunity, to make it absolutely clear that we are abolitionists, and that even if our other amendments seek to modify the Bill in particular areas, we are at heart abolitionists. Otherwise, we are forced, I think, to have a vote on amendment No. 1 at this stage, and then wait until we reach about amendment No. 45 on clause 4, which would cause some difficulties. If you were prepared to accept a vote on new clause 6, I would seek the Committee's leave to withdraw amendment No. 1 and we could defer the vote until that time. I realise that it would not be very satisfactory to have a vote somewhat detached from the debate. The problem is that we have to have the votes in the order in which the amendments are on the order paper. I seek your guidance, Mr. Morris.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to help the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 66, in page 1, line 6, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>" (1) Where in any proceedings it is shown that—
	<ol>
	<li>corporal punishment has been given to a pupil by or on the authority of a member of staff other than a headteacher or a teacher acting on the authority of a headteacher, or in relation to a pupil for whom education is being provided by or for a local education authority at a place other than a school, by anyone other than a teacher employed by the authority; or</li>
	<li>corporal punishment has been given to a pupil for whom a statement of special educational needs is maintained, by or on the authority of a member of the staff, or</li>
	<li>(i) corporal punishment has been given to a pupil by a headteacher or a teacher acting on the authority of a headteacher, employed by a local education authority for the purpose of providing education for a pupil otherwise than at school, and</li>
	<ol>
	<li>at the time the punishment was given, the pupil was exempt from corporal punishment by him, giving the punishment cannot be justified on the ground that it was done in pursuance of a right exercisable by the member of staff by virtue of his position as such ".</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote>
To ensure that the European Court judgment is fully respected the Bill must include within its scope all those who may have a defence in law if they beat a child in a school. Presumably, that is the reason for the wide definition of "member of the staff" in clause 1(8). The amendment is intended to ensure that only headteachers or teachers acting on their authority—or, when pupils are being educated other than at school, those acting by permission of the local education authority—can administer corporal punishment. Perhaps we are in danger of sometimes being too anecdotal, but I should point out to the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing)—I regret that he is not present now—that I started my teaching career in Scotland and I appreciate the conditions about which he spoke. Indeed, although my experience was many years ago, it is perhaps why I take the view that I now hold on corporal punishment. There was the famous chaplain's last stand, when he was approached by a horde of unruly children and defended himself on his podium with a cane. There have also been references to boys beating boys and master beating boys from my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Malins), but I feel strongly that those days are past. It is clear to anyone with a knowledge of the independent sector of education that the jibes levelled against it in this respect are largely false, but I should like to talk about the practical reality of corporal punishment in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I wrote to all the head teachers of the 76 schools in my constituency to ask for their opinions on the matter, and about a third of them have so far responded. Overwhelmingly, the head teachers were abolitionist and the position of the few who were not was that they wished to retain the right to beat, the use of the cane was rare indeed and nobody but themselves was permitted to use it. Therefore, the practical fact is that head teachers are reserving that right to themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are, of course, cowboy schools where that is not the case. As ever, we have to consider legislating for the minority rather than just the majority and I have that minority in mind. The variation in the use of corporal punishment in schools is rather startling and I can find no uniformity of opinion. There are 125 local education authorities in the United Kingdom of which 22 have abolished corporal punishment altogether. Of the 103 retentionist authorities, 99 allow sixth formers to be beaten, 90 allow all primary school children to be beaten, 86 allow infants to be beaten, 87 allow handicapped
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
children to be beaten, 97 place no limit on the number of strokes or blows allowed, 87 allow public beatings, 65 allow male teachers to beat girls, and 98 allow female teachers to beat boys. Seventeen authorities have no rules at all and leave the matter entirely to the discretion of head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that that is not a satisfactory position and I seek to improve the Bill by my amendment. It seems essential, too, that there should be provision to ensure that non-teaching staff, such as caretakers, school dinner staff and ancillary workers, cannot, in any circumstances, administer corporal punishment in schools with impunity. The amendment would also exempt from corporal punishment pupils who have a statement of special educational needs under the Education Act 1981, wherever they were being educated, by removing the defence referred to in clause 1(1) from a member of staff who administered such punishment to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the most ardent supporters of corporal punishment tend to hesitate over advocating it for handicapped young people. Yet we see, as I cited earlier, that a large number of authorities allow handicapped children to be beaten. In response to the Department of Education and Science consultation that preceded the Bill, the Voluntary Council for Handicapped Children, which is an umbrella group representing organisations working in that sphere, wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p> "We are convinced that the use of corporal punishment is inappropriate for any children in school, and particularly undesirable when a child may have a disability or special needs."</p></blockquote>
The Royal College of Psychiatrists, in a memorandum to the Government, wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children who are suffering from handicap, emotional disturbance or severe deprivation are possibly the most likely to receive it and the most likely to be harmed."</p></blockquote>
Similarly, the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation responded to the DES consultation:
	<br><blockquote><p>" We would emphasise our objection to corporal punishment of any kind. We believe that in no circumstances should physically disabled children be subject to corporal punishment as not only is it an inappropriate method of maintaining discipline, but may also physically harm the child concerned."</p></blockquote>
The Campaign for the Mentally Handicapped also called for complete abolition, adding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As an organisation working with and for people with mental handicaps, we are particularly concerned that any moves to change the current position should ensure that mentally handicapped children do not continue to receive corporal punishment."</p></blockquote>
During the debate in the House of Lords in 1981 on the Education Bill, Baroness Young, then a Minister of State at the DES, said that she believed that the use of corporal punishment on handicapped children was wrong. While it is true that integration of children with special needs is increasing in all our schools, and the overriding aim is to achieve as normal an environment as possible for them, the overwhelming professional view is that the potential dangers of using corporal punishment on such children are too great to risk. As some children are to be exempt under the Bill on the ground of parental objection, there is no longer an argument against exempting others on the ground of special needs. I wish to ensure that only head teachers and teachers acting on their specific authority can administer corporal punishment and to exempt pupils with statements of special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) for raising that important and interesting point to which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary should give serious consideration. The phrase used in clause 1(1) is "member of the staff" and in subsection (8) that phrase is sufficiently widely defined to include non-teaching employees of the school or authority—for example, a caretaker. If one looked only at subsection (1) one would suppose that the defence was available to all members of staff, including non-teachers. I am sure that the Committee would shrink from the proposition that non-teachers should have the right to administer corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not believe that that is the case. My understanding is that the Bill is largely declaratory of the present common law position and that only people who stand in loco parentis in relation to any child has the common law defence to a charge of assault. Therefore, it follows that school caretakers not standing in loco parentis do not have the common law defence of standing in loco parentis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is correct, there is an inconsistency between clause 1(1), which is broadly defined, and the present common law position. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary that he should look at subsection (8) to see whether the phrase "member of the staff" should not be defined more narrowly so that it is clear that subsection (1) applies only to members of the teaching staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In maintained schools with boarding facilities a matron or other member of staff with supervisory responsibilities may also be deemed to be in loco parentis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so and I take the point. Whether a matron should exercise corporal punishment is an open question. If we assume that my hon. Friend is correct, I am prepared to see the definition in subsection (8) expanded to include teaching staff and those who have a direct supervisory role over pupils. However, I oppose the concept that anyone who happens to be a member of staff should be covered by subsection (1), even though the defence of in loco parentis would not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend look again at the definition subsection with a view to rephrasing it to include only those to whom the defence of in loco parentis applies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, I am enchanted by my hon. Friend's comments. If some children on school premises or on the site were behaving in a way that was a danger to themselves, other children, or members of staff, and a caretaker walked past, would my hon. Friend argue that that caretaker should walk by, look the other way and let those children cause harm, rather than restrain them in such a way that might be deemed to have been the application of corporal punishment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend cannot have read the Bill carefully, or he would appreciate that if the purpose of force is to prevent injury to pupils, subsection (3) would apply and, accordingly, the offence could not be made out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennet</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not being suggested that an individual's common law rights to protect himself or property should be removed. I hope that the point will be pressed that only a qualified teacher should administer the punishment if punishment is to be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish in that there are a number of lawful circumstances in which physical force can be applied, for example, in self defence, to prevent injury to a third party—the statutory exception—or to prevent injury to property. Those are all common law offences that are in no way affected by the Bill. They would run in any event. We are dealing here with the administration of corporal punishment outside the range of common law offences, save in the context of in loco parentis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman that the administering of punishment should be confined to qualified teachers. I think that I am persuaded by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State that there are people with a supervisory role who should have that power. However, I would not extend it to the caretaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another problem with a supervisory role in that it leads one towards games coaches and roundsmen who have responsibility for coaching younger boys in cricket or other sports and those who are not on the teaching staff as such but have what one might call a supervisory role. It is rare in many schools to find a person employed there who does not have a supervisory role, even it is just by way of coaching in sport, or in carpentry or something like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a sound point. But I do not want to extend the powers in subsection (I) right down the scale of those employed by a school. I was contemplating qualified teachers, and the matron, but the idea that the carpentry fellow or the gym instructor or the caretaker or any other person employed by the school are covered by subsection (1) is anathema to me, and I will not have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary replies that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury has raised an interesting point and that he will go away and look at it again, I shall reply "Splendid. I can support you." If on the other hand he tells my hon. Friend, "You are a tiresome fellow and I shall have nothing to do with your amendment" then I shall have to tell him that I may vote against him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) will come a little further with us. I realise that his experience are of the so-called public school—the private sector, in fact—because of his examples about matron and the possibility of the carpentry fellow not being qualified. However, I remind him that in most instances our debates will relate to the state sector. I do not wish to discourage him from supporting the amendment—there are strong arguments for his doing so anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Salisbury made the valid point that if corporal punishment is to be administered, it should be on the authority of, and with the permission of, the head teacher, and that that should be made clear. I cannot see any circumstances in which a teacher ought to have to justify administering corporal punishment, whether or not the youngster was on the register, unless
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
the head gave approval and authority. If we are to retain corporal punishment, in a sense we have to encourage its ritual element rather than its pain element. It has to rest on the disgrace of being punished rather than on the fact that pain is being inflicted deliberately. The ritual element is that the head has to know, and has to authorise the punishment. Amendment No. 66 is useful because it makes it clear that punishment must be administered on authority from the head teacher. Then we must turn our attention to the question of who can administer it, and we should say firmly that, if anybody is to do so, it should be a qualified teacher. The hon. Gentleman may have more faith in matrons than I have, but in many public sector schools the matron may not be particularly qualified, although I suspect that in most such schools the head would not dream of allowing anyone but a qualified teacher to administer the punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the hon. Gentleman about the problem that arises in some of our better-staffed primary schools, where there are ancillary assistants working under the supervision of the teacher. In one that I was in not long ago, the fairly young and recently qualified teacher was working with an ancillary assistant who could have been her mother. The ancillary said that they got on extremely well, that the teacher planned and organised the lessons and was in control of the class and that she, the ancillary, was ancillary and was assisting. The one thing that the qualified teacher was worried about was that the ancillary was occasionally inclined to give some of the children a slap. She made the point that the likelihood of that happening had more to do with whether the ancillary was feeling tired and worn at the end of the day than with the youngster's behaviour. She was very worried and disturbed by that. They got on well, but although the teacher tried to tell her that she did not want that sort of thing going on in her classroom, it was difficult to break the habit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we make it clear in legislation that only a qualified teacher can inflict corporal punishment, we avoid that problem. Therefore, it is important to make it clear that, if corporal punishment is to continue it should be administered only by a qualified teacher. If it is necessary for public schools to have a provision that covers a matron or someone else carrying out supervision during the evening, so be it, but for the state sector "qualified teacher" is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also pay attention to the point about excluding from corporal punishment children who have a statement saying that they have special educational needs. I am very worried that in a few special schools, particularly special schools for the maladjusted, far too much corporal punishment still goes on. It can rarely be justified with a disturbed youngster, but in some schools it seems to be the simple solution. I believe that, instead of solving problems, it increases problems at those schools, but teachers resort to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept the three points in the amendment—that corporal punishment should be administered only on the authority of a head teacher and only by a qualified teacher, and that in no circumstances should it be carried out in special schools or anywhere else on a child on whom a statement has been made. The hon. Gentleman will be well aware that at the Committee stage of the Bill dealing with special educational needs Baroness Young said that in her view there were no circumstances in which corporal
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
punishment should be administered to a child receiving special education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister will look with sympathy at the amendment, he will do a great deal to speed up our proceedings, because it contains very reasonable proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have enjoyed the exchanges—in which I was a minor participant—between my hon. Friends the Members for Salisbury (Mr. Key) and for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) and the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). Like Salome, perhaps I can take my time about getting to the point on which they wish in particular to hear me reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, which was so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury—whom I would never describe as tiresome, even if I thought it—has two distinct parts. The first relates to those who may use corporal punishment and the other to the effective exclusion of pupils who have a statement of special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, I believe that it would be wrong to create restrictions. Each teacher has an in loco parentis responsibility, which carries with it the duty to care for pupils and the right to use reasonable and moderate corporal punishment. The Bill will make only a limited impact on this position. Indeed, once we begin to introduce questions about the head or LEA giving delegated authority, we run into practical difficulties. How is the delegated authority to be given? What happens when some or many of the staff are away from school because of illness or other special circumstances? The school would find its own way round these difficulties by giving delegated authority to all its teachers, and thus the intention of my hon. Friends amendment would be thwarted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must also bear in mind that the Bill covers the actions of a wider range of staff other than teachers. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) made that point. Matrons, boarding staff and others may well have in loco parentis rights and responsibilities, and we should not lightly take away the right to use a slap on the leg when the circumstances warrant it and the parents have agreed in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A member of the staff will have an in loco parentis defence if he has supervision of a child, so too, in some circumstances, will matrons and boarding staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some circumstances, such as those I outlined earlier, even caretakers might be in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having listened to the blandishments of my hon. Friends I will undertake to look into the matter further, without an absolute guarantee that I can do what they want. I am sure that they will accept that in the honest spirit in which it is given. If they remain unhappy with the result of my further investigations, there are, of course, other occasions during the passage of the Bill when they can take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave the illustration of the head teacher and the fact that he could give authority to all the staff. I do not object to that. If the head makes a decision and gives the authority, that is all right. We are concerned if the head says, "I am the only person who will administer corporal punishment", or "I shall allow three of my named senior staff to do so." As I understand the Bill, if someone who is not given authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
by the head actually administers corporal punishment he may be involved in a disciplinary complaint through the head but he can still use all of clause 1 as justification for his act if he is brought to court, namely, that he was giving corporal punishment to a pupil on the register. I think it important to make it clear that he can use that defence only if he had been given the authority by the head teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have' said, I am prepared to be reasonably flexible. I am a man without prejudice and of total tolerance on these matters. I shall do what I can to meet the points made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the second part of the amendment, which deals with children with special needs. I say immediately that I have considerable sympathy with the amendments intention, which, again was supported by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. However, I believe that it would be undesireable and would produce inconsistencies due to variation in education authorities' practicies in relation to statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that, as the common law stands, teachers can use only moderate and reasonable corporal punishment. This will remain the case when the Bill is enacted even in dealing with those pupils whose names are on the register. Teachers know very well that when they are dealing with a child who has special educational needs—which, as the Committee knows, cover an immense spectrum ranging from a slight learning problem through difficulties caused by minor handicaps to the difficulties of those who manifest serious behavioural and social problems—they must exercise special care in dealing with that child. The teacher is in the best position to judge what approach to adopt in any given situation. While, by and large, teachers do not use corporal punishment on children with special educational needs, to ban the use of this sanction entirely could be undesirable. I think that the Committee will accept that as a major point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be unfair because there is a wide variation in practice among individual education authorities when dealing with special educational needs. Nor is there a satisfactory dividing line any longer between those in special schools and those in ordinary schools. Under the Education Act 1981 those pupils with milder difficulties may be integrated into ordinary schools while being given the protection of a statement. To base exclusion from corporal punishment on whether a child has a statement would not be satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Committee accepts, from the reasonable tone of our debate on the amendment, that we are dealing with a sensitive issue and that a sensitive approach is needed. The parent will know, particulary in cases when his child has a statement for special educational need following multi-professional assessment of his problems and abilities, what those needs are. The parent has the absolute right under the Bill to exempt his child from corporal punishment. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene. Ministers of all Governments are notorious for making bland statements and saying that such and such a proposal would not be practical. I listened with great interest to the Minister's reasons why the introduction of the exemption for children with a certificate of special needs would not be practical. The Minister says that the reason is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
variation in practice by education authorities. If the amendment were adopted, there would not be any variation. His excuse is taken away because the amendment would make the practice uniform. All children with a certificate of special educational needs would be exempt from corporal punishment. It seems illogical and inconsistent for the Minister not to accept the amendment due to the variation in practice across education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to realise that children in special education are there for an enormous variety of reasons. They need selective teaching and support from the educational services. Occasionally, temper tantrums can lead to hysteria. People in special education are the most caring in the world. They are experts. Those do not choose to use corporal punishment. However, they use it when a child, who has an abnormality, has a temper tantrum to prevent him from going into hysteria which is serious. They use the short, sharp shock. It is not used as a punishment, but it could be interpreted as such if we are not careful. Discretion must be left with teachers in such instances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is making a speech rather than an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. However, I have made my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Gentleman in his tribute to teachers who work in special schools. I am privileged because one of the finest schools in my constituency is staffed by just such a dedicated band of teachers who educate difficult children. I pay tribute to teachers throughout the country who work in such schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not reminiscing, but when I first came to the House the education of such children—certainly in Scotland—was not the responsibility of education authorities but of social work departments. All the arguments which the Minister raised tonight against his hon. Friend's amendment were put forward then—by successive Governments. I do not make a political point. However, a group of us argued that such children could be integrated into the normal educational system and educated to the limit of their abilities. We all have a limit to our own ability. It reached the stage where Scottish Members from all parties formed a group, led by the now Lord Gray—then Hamish Gray—the former member for Ross and Cromarty. Lord Gray was lucky; he came out in the top six and introduced a private Member's Bill. I stress that private members, not a Government, were responsible for transferring—from the social work departments to the education system in Scotland—the responsibility for educating those children. The Minister will look back on that and verify and testify to the success of that move—made against all the advice, pleadings and opposition of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply say to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) that there are times when a Committee must impose its will on a Government. Such issues will not bring down the Government or even get the Minister a mild rap on the knuckles. They will not cost him his job. The amendment would make a difference and would state much more clearly who is exempt from corporal punishment and who has the right to administer such punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham raised a good point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
about those who are allowed to administer corporal punishment. The Minister seemed unsure about whether matrons or dormitory and residential boarding house staff had responsibilities in loco parentis. I think I quote the Minister correctly in saying, "They may have". We know the rights of teachers. However, do dormitory and similar staff have responsibilities in loco parentis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, I suggest, a question of fact in every case for the court to determine whether a degree of supervision existed so as to create responsibilities in loco parentis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his advice. I refer especially to the special needs children. We now have an opportunity that will not arise again for some time. Once legislation is on the statute book, it is the devil's own job to bring forward amending legislation. It could be another 10 or 15 years before we can return to the matter, so we must seize opportunities as they arise. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Salisbury will press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members who have contributed to the debate and to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for his assurance that he will further examine the question of restricting the use of corporal punishment to head teachers. That is absolutely fundamental and we shall watch closely to see how far he goes towards that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make this clear to my hon. Friend because I should not wish him to express a view on my behalf which I did not hold. Certainly, I would seek to restrict the use of corporal punishment—perhaps to make it more narrow as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham. However, I cannot undertake—as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury wishes—to restrict its use to head teachers alone. I hope that I did not suggest that I could give that undertaking. My hon. Friend the member for Grantham sought to pull in the net. He thought that it was too wide. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury is asking me to go even further to put the noose round my own neck in a way that I would find most uncomfortable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I understand why he wished to clarify the point I made and perhaps overstated a little. As for the special needs, I am much less happy. No one who has had anything to do with special education could but fail to be concerned about the issue. I have always had an interest in special education. For some years I was chairman of the governors of the Great Ormond Street hospital special school. I cannot imagine that anyone at that school would consider using corporal punishment in any circumstances. I am sure that that is true of most special schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit however that there is a flaw in my argument. The Bill will create a two-tier system of discipline, which many of us think is undesirable. I fear that if I press the amendment, a further sub-class might be created in the existing two-tier system. That would be even more undesirable than the system which the Government wish to impose. Therefore, all I can say is that when our debate is brought to the attention of local education authorities,I
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
hope that they will think twice about the situation in their schools now. The Government intend to increase the influence of parents and governors in schools, and I believe that that too will have a desirable effect. Moreover, later in the Committee's proceedings, I think that there will be another opportunity for a bite at this cherry. For those reasons, and in view of the assurance from my hon. Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government Whip will consider a motion to end this sitting when we have completed this group of amendments. If I understood the hon. Gentleman's nod correctly, I shall not need to spend too long talking about the amendments, although if pressed we could draw out the debate to 7.30 pm. However, on the basis that we shall try to finish then, I shall be as brief as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by making a general point to the Government. It is helpful for hon. Members to receive notes on clauses, but it is especially helpful if they receive them before they table amendments. Many of the amendments—certainly, the whole of this group are probing amendments to find out exactly what is meant. If the notes on clauses were available to hon. Members very soon after Second Reading, and certainly before we need to table amendments, and the notes on clauses were also available to outside groups, it would be much less necessary for us to table many of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in this group come from two directions—from those who are a little anxious that the Bill is drawn to widely and from others who are concerned that it is not drawn widely enough. I shall now sit down so that the Minister can explain why the amendments are unnecessary. Then, if need be, I can return to the separate points. I stress that they are all probing amendments. I shall listen with interest to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a short debate. Indeed, I have only just gathered together my papers so that I can reply. However, I now hope that I can given the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) a helpful reply. As the hon. Gentleman said, these are probing amendments intended to give me the opportunity of explaining what lies behind the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Amendment No. 2 relates to clause 1(3), which I consider essential because it makes it clear that teachers who have a duty to protect people and property from immediate danger caused by pupils are able to fulfil that duty without having to consider whether a child is exempt from corporal punishment. That may hark back to what was said earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham, although the actors would change and the names would not be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many circumstances a teacher must act quickly to protect a pupil or to protect property. Often his action will take the form of physical intervention, which might amount to battery and could have an element of punishment. For example, let us suppose that a teacher is leading a crocodile of unruly infant pupils along a busy and dangerous road to the swimming baths. He is holding one unruly pupil by the hand. The pupil makes as if to dash across the road in front of fast-moving traffic; the teacher restrains him, but he nevertheless continues to try to break free. In the interests of the child's safety the teacher might well decide to smack the child on the leg, and I am sure that we would all accept that that would be the action of a reasonable, concerned adult. Yet it could be construed as punishment for misbehaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give another example. A secondary school teacher passing the chemistry laboratory sees several pupils engaged in horseplay surrounded by dangerous equipment and chemicals. He intervenes using—as he might have to—a reasonable amount of force to quell the disturbance. In such circumstances, a teacher cannot consult a corporal punishment register to see who is and who is not exempt from corporal punishment, nor would it make sense to expect him to distinguish between pupils. But the pupils in the laboratory need to be protected from the immediate danger caused by their own folly. The ordinary issue of parental views must be overridden in such circumstances, but again it might be argued that the use of reasonable force could amount to corporal punishment as defined in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered what would happen if two boys were fighting, and the teacher had to engage in physical force to separate them and prevent further injury? Presumably he would not be subject to the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not thought of such an instance, and I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's observations. After all, he speaks with some authority, having spent many years as a teacher and headmaster in the maintained sector. But I hope that the examples that I have given have not been uncommon in his many years of experience. There are occasions when not exactly rioting, but dispute, breaks out in classrooms between two children which may bring in others and cause real dangers. That could happen not only in the laboratory but in the gymnasium where children are doing exercises, in the carpentry shop, the woodwork room or metalwork room. The hon. Gentleman, as a teacher and a reasonable man, would first try to separate the children and quell the disturbance to prevent damage to the children—the loss of a limb or an eye or even, tragically, the death of a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive my asking a technical question, but it concerned me a good deal. I should accept a written reply. Is it intended that the subsection will prevent an act such as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
teacher intervening to prevent a pupil attacking someone else or damaging property being regarded as a criminal offence? If so, I am worried about the word "include".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for reasons that include averting"</p></blockquote>
a number of circumstances. Is the subsection meant to be an all-inclusive statement of the circumstances that will not constitute a criminal offence, or merely to give examples? I can contemplate situations that do not fall within subsection (3) but which should not constitute a criminal offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing his learned mind to the assistance of the Committee once again. An off-the-cuff comment from me would support his view, but I suspect that I shall soon have a blinding flash of inspiration that will tell me the precise answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will accept that we need to protect teachers who act with the best motives and in ways that would gain wide support. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham suggested, subsection (3) seeks to give that essential protection. It is the counterbalance to subsection (2) with which it needs to be considered. Subsection (2) covers any battery where there is an element of punishment, however small. Subsection (3), sensibly, tips the scales the other way in the interest of teachers acting as we—parents, taxpayers, ratepayers and members of the wider community—would expect them to act
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that amendment No. 3 is a probing amendment aimed at establishing the purpose of the words "apart from any justification" in clause 1(2). Their purpose is to prevent a legal uncertainty about whether an act is a battery for the purposes of the definition of corporal punishment. The law recognises a number of justifications other than in loco parentis for the application of physical force to the person—for example, self defence, the prevention of crime, and consent in circumstances such as lawful sports. However, in one of those situations it is unclear in law whether there is no battery or whether there is a defence to an action of battery. The words to which the amendment relates ensure that that question is ignored in deciding whether a battery has been committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words are simply intended to clarify what is meant by battery. Of course, if the teacher has had a legal justification of the kind to which I referred, he would still be able to use it as a defence in legal proceedings. I assure hon. Members that the words concern only legal justifications such as I have mentioned, and that they would not enable a member of staff to avoid liability by seeking to show that the corporal punishment was justified on some other basis. I accept that this is a rather technical and difficult explanation, but I hope that in the light of it the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still have not had the blinding flash, but will shortly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in the Minister's notes on the next amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), whom I like enormously, teases me almost to the point of aggravation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to discuss amendment No. 64 which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
relates to subsection (3) and action that might be taken by a teacher to protect property or people. The Committee will accept that such action would be on the spur of the moment and the precise combination of motivation may be difficult to disentangle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A teacher may slap a child's leg to stop him from running on to a dangerous road. The prime motivation will be to avert immediate danger. But there may be other thoughts running through the teacher's mind. "If I slap this boy on the leg I will stop him running into the road—and I may make him think twice about doing the same when I am not here." As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham will know, those mixed motives could be a source of endless discussion in court. The wording of the subsection cuts through those difficulties. If one of the teacher's motives is to avert immediate danger, that is enough. The complications of what exactly was running through the teacher's mind do not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present working is in the interests of common sense. Having probed the meaning, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 6, I accept the proposition that the Bill should place no legal barriers in the way of attempting to avert immediate danger to pupils—any pupils—but the wording of the subsection is adequate for the purpose. The word "person" in line 4 includes any pupil, whether it is the pupil causing the danger or some other pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have suddenly had one of those revelations that come to Ministers in these circumstances. I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham that we are dealing with several offences. Clause 1(3) is exhaustive of the cases where the in loco parentis defence still applies to the punishment of an exempted pupil. If my hon. Friend is still unhappy with that I am sure that he will make his views known in the robust manner for which he is famous and I shall undertake to make sure that he receives an explanation in a brown envelope, sealed and sent privately through the post.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee on this. Nevertheless, I am worried because if subsection (3) is meant to be exhaustive it is oddly phrased. It uses the words "for reasons that include" and then specifies reasons. That suggests that there are reasons not included in the subsection, but that is not compatible with an exhaustive definition of protective reasons. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary would reconsider whether subsection (3) is aptly phrased to contain and set out an exhaustive statement of the protective reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had dealt earlier with that
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
problem. This is a difficult technical matter. If my hon. Friend wishes to bring to my attention difficulties which his legal mind has unravelled, I shall be happy to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary the phrase implies that there are other reasons which are not included. As I understand my hon. Friend, however, subsection (3) purports to set out all the reasons that can be relied on—in which case the words "that include" are not just otiose but misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to appear churlish in the light of my hon. Friend's incisive deliberations, but we are dealing with cases where the in loco parentis defence still applies, so he must accept that the subsection is adequate for the purposes to which I have referred. With the kindest will in the world and much as I like then hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, I cannot offer any hope of further changes. I am satisfied, as I hope the Committee is, with the various explanations that I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for those replies. I had hoped that he would also refer to the question of "or any other pupil", but I do not want to press him at this stage. The trouble is that the Bill will produce problems for both parents and teachers. I hope that the Minister will give some consideration to the practical needs of teachers, parents and pupils because they need to know exactly where they stand. I am not greatly impressed by the argument that it will be a defence to use in other litigation. Lawyers may like litigation, but I should have thought that it was in the interests of pupils, teachers and parents to avoid litigation as far as possible and to have the situation set out clearly. There is some attraction in having a clear definition of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment, consider carefully what the Minister has said and what other people may tell us, and possibly return to the subject on Report if we are not satisfied with the Minister's reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
