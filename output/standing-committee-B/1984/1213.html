</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (St. Helens, South): When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday, I had built myself, as it were, into the middle of a sentence. My first words were:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Therefore, perhaps we can build into it".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 11 December 1984; c. 150.]</p></blockquote>
I shall complete the sentence. Perhaps we can build into the Bill a company that is designed to meet the needs of the film industry so that it can perform the functions that we would expect from it, if, indeed, the financing of the British film industry is to be secured in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there is a real division between some of us, on both sides of the Committee, about our intentions. We hope that the Bill will emerge as one which gives the film industry the structure that it needs to survive in a fiercely competitive world. From much of what has been said, it is clear that the son of NFFC must be so structured as not to allow any one party to dominate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opening remarks at the previous sitting, I made passing reference to Thom EMI and Rank. I shall not at this time rehearse the participation of those companies in the making of films. A company will be set up. I accept that the Government's present proposals are merely proposals and do not appear in great detail on the face of the Bill, which is a tragedy, perhaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the current proposals, it seems that Thom EMI, Rank and Channel 4 will be involved. I am not being critical of any of those companies. A tribute was paid to Channel 4 for the work it has done in promoting the film industry in Britain. I associate myself with that tribute on every conceivable occasion. Indeed, Conservative Members have often heard me say that it does not matter who funds the film industry. I worry not from where the funds come. They may come from Channel 4, the City or even from private individuals, though nowadays not many private individuals could afford it. I worry not, so long as the money comes-That must be our aim and object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
I do not propose Mr. Crowther, to stray beyond the ambit of the amendments, because I know that you will promptly call me to order if I do. No doubt I shall again say " pro tem " and realise that is what happens whenever one is called to order. I shall take amendment No. 11 as the starting point. The purpose behind the amendment is to set out the basis of a public corporation—that is to say, a public corporation within the concept of a non-dividend-paying corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about this matter, because the first thing to be decided is whether the son of NFFC is to be a public company—that is, a company that does not have shareholders to whom it pays dividends—or a private company, if I may call it that. I see the Minister's eyes turning towards me, so I shall explain what I mean by a private company. In this context, a private company is one that has shareholders to whom dividends are paid. I accept that many private companies are known as public companies because they are quoted on the Stock Exchange, but that is not the distinction that I want to make in this instance. The distinction I want to make between " public " and " private " is whether or not there are shareholders to whom a dividend can be paid. If there are such shareholders, the membership of the company—that is, the number of subscribers to the company—is widened. I hope that the Minister will accept that meaning of " private ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a private company, I do not preclude the concept of it having a wide share ownership, which could take it into the realms of a Plc—to use the normal nomenclature—and perhaps to quotation on the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, amendment No. 11 restricts us. As I have said, I told my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham that I was toying with the idea of tabling a further amendment to his amendment No. 11 to add to paragraph (	<i>a</i>)(ii), after the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"any trading profit made in the preceding year "</p></blockquote>
the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"after payment of dividend".</p></blockquote>
That would make the amendment relate to a private company, within the meaning that I have described, and thus enable it to have a wider share ownership. So with all due respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham, perhaps the drafting of amendment No. 11 should be slightly altered. I shall certainly give way to him, if he wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that amendment No. 11 is merely one of a number of different solutions to the problem. However, he should not overlook subsection (3A) because it will give him the clue to the intention of the amendment. It is designed not to define the conditions under which the company will operate but to offer conditions to any conceivable company that would be found acceptable. So the real purpose of amendment No. 11 is to preserve the National Film Finance Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps like the young boy I once was, who used to tickle trout in the streams in the spring, I have deliberately tickled that point out. As my hon. Friend said, the intention of amendment No. 11, although I was not going to say so, is to keep Daddy instead of buying this new son.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, of course, that the Minister will never allow us to keep the National Film Finance Corporation. He and the Government are determined that we shall have the son of NFFC, to whom we are now trying to give some bones. Being a reasonable man, therefore, and working on the assumption that we cannot keep Daddy, I am trying to make the son at least presentable. That may be why amendment No. 11 is, in its own quiet way, a very good amendment, but one accepts that the public nature of the company will not be retained, which is why I suggested tentatively that a slight amendment to amendment No. 11 would produce a wider body having private participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are hooked on the drug of privatisation. Sometimes that is not a bad thing. One can, perhaps, understand their logic on the rare occasion, but in dealing with national assets and national interests it is never a good idea. However, I shall not develop the argument for or against privatisation because I know that you, Mr. Crowther, will call me to order once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have a private body, it is not in the interests of the industry that it should lie in but a few hands. The present signs are that the company should lie in the hands of four groups of persons, if I can put it that way—Thom, Rank, Channel 4 and a video body—but I ask the Minister to consider carefully the principles behind my remarks in respect of the company's construction, because if we are to have the son, the son should consist of many parts and be in a position to invite subscribers to it who lie without the four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next stage of the argument relates to amendments Nos. 6 and 40 and what might be called the golden share option, or the controlling share option. If the son is to be a limited company—I suspect that the Minister will insist that it be a private limited company in the context of " private " which I explained earlier—we look to these amendments, both of which are much in the same spirit. They leave with the Secretary of State a single share—the golden share, as I think it was called in the British Telecom Bill, as it then was. The golden share means that there is a restraining hand on the future of the company. Indeed, when dealing with something that is of great importance to the state, ownership of the company should remain with the state. With British Telecom, the concept of the golden share applied to the son, as it were, and in this instance that concept of the son should remain. An example has been cited of the studios that could have been disposed of but were not because, again, restraining control existed with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 36 and 40 are much in the same spirit and similarly drafted. They carry the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
names of many Committee members, who appear to subscribe to the same principle. It seems that that principle is widely accepted in Committee and I am sure that the Minister can take it on board without our having to put the amendments to the test. That is in no way a threatening suggestion to the Minister; it is a sort of gentle tip that the experts consider the principle to be no bad thing and one that the Government could easily take on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we are all agreed on the construction of the company. We may not agree with the wording of the amendments, but we must agree with the spirit in which the amendments were moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham. No doubt, the amendments will be supported by many Committee members as the debate continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it important that the construction of the company should lie on the face of the Bill. It will show a positive intention. It will not look as though we are setting up a company after the Bill has been enacted. We have seen that before. There is a good precedent for positive behaviour. The Bill dealing with the cable industry started in Committee with a few ifs, ands and buts. It had more positive meat in it after our consideration had been completed because the Committee felt that that was how the Bill should stand in the interests of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister, with the kindest of seasonal greetings, that we should proceed in that manner when dealing with this Bill too. Perhaps we should lay on the face of the Bill the concept of the company. I do not suggest that we should write in the memorandum and articles of association of the company at this stage. However, we should lay down its skeleton form in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The function of the chief executive of the company is of primary importance. It has already been said that it would be difficult to find a man to fill the task. I suggest that it would not be so difficult because such a man would have the development and continued nurturing of the British industry at heart. That is the man we want. Such a man exists. I shall not be so bold as to make any suggestions, but I am sure that anyone who knows the industry will have a galaxy of names in mind of those who have the necessary capability, integrity, drive and initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been appointed by the Secretary of State, such a man should be removed only by the Secretary of State. That makes the company a little different from the normal commercial company. We are dealing with an industry that is a little different from other industries and that is why amendment No. 15 is of considerable importance to the future of the film industry. One could quarrel with the drafting of the amendment but I do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to see in the son that is being created the interests which are sometimes found within the board rooms of private companies. I referred earlier to substantial commercial interests. If the chief executive were answerable only to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
board of the new son, the board would often be tempted to go back to clause 3(3)(	<i>a</i>). It is a lawyer's paradise. It says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>" the company will use its best endeavours to encourage the production of relevant films on a commercially successful basis".</p></blockquote>
What is meant by " commercially successful "? Does it mean that a film has to be like " Chariots of Fire ", " Star Wars " or " Gremlins "? I have not yet seen " Gremlins " but I understand that it is not bad. Much depends whether one is over or under the age of 15. My being slightly over the age of 15, but with a film-going mentality said to be under the age of 15, perhaps I shall enjoy " Gremlins ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the test of whether a film is made
	<br><blockquote><p>"on a commercially successful basis "</p></blockquote>
be conducted? That could exclude many films of an experimental type, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) referred at our previous sitting. Again, it might exclude—there is always this risk with something that is avant-garde—the financing of innovative films and new techniques. The definition of a commercially successful film might be that, for intance, it eventually made a £1 profit, but although it may not have been a great financial success it may have been a huge success in artistic terms. We must protect the financing of such films. If the chief executive of the company in question were answerable to the Secretary of State he would not have a licence to run amok with his prejudices, so to speak —although I do not believe for one moment that that would happen—and he would not be subject to the same commercial pressures in the boardroom that he might otherwise be. In the nature of his appointment, that chief executive would need to have a broad perspective. We must move away from the concept that we are dealing with a commercial entity; we are considering a special entity, which requires its own special rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr John Garst 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly challenges the meaning of " commercially successful"; I am sure that we are all grateful to him for that. However, he has not challenged the earlier wording, which is even more important, when the clause says that the Secretary of State may
	<br><blockquote><p>"arrange for the right to be transferred"</p></blockquote>
to the company
	<br><blockquote><p>" in whose case he is satisfied"</p></blockquote>
about certain matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase " he is satisfied " also needs challenging. For how long will the Secretary of State be satisfied? By what process of inquiry will he be satisfied? Will he monitor his satisfaction and will it be subject to periodic examination? Unless we know the answer to those questions, the hon. Gentleman's point is probably stillborn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, once again, he has put his finger on the point. However, at an earlier sitting of the Committee the water surrounding those questions was tested. I am trying to be very careful in staying within the parameters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
of the amendments; I am worried that I may be called to order if I start to go down a different road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said, it is a matter of the Secretary of State being satisfied, but what is the test of that? The Minister must answer the hon. Gentleman's question in due course if he is to reassure the Committee and show us that the company which is to take over the rights will do so in a way that encourages continuance of the financing of the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that if a company, public or private, were set up along the lines that I proposed, with a chief executive who is answerable to the Minister, one of his functions would be to convince the Minister that the company was developing in the way that the Committee and the House of Commons decided in the Bill that it should. In other words, the line of accountability would be from the chief executive to the Minister who is, of course, answerable to the House of Commons. Therefore, checks and balances would be provided. One assumes that the appointed chief executive would report annually to the Minister. Perhaps that could be written into the Bill, but I do not seek to write too much into it because there are certain areas of commonsense that would apply in any event. However, if the chief executive of the company that we had created reported annually to the Minister, it is obvious that for his appointment to continue he would need to satisfy the Minister that the company was continuing to pursue the objectives which the Bill had set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the point raised by the hon. Member for Hendon, North would be covered if the Minister were to appoint the chief executive. Not only would he be free from the commercial pressures to which I referred but there would be a degree of accountability. " Accountability " is a good word and not the dirty one which some try to make it out to be. It shows that one is seeking to pursue the objectives that have been set. Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain to us whether he would be satisfied merely by appointing the chief executive, who would be answerable to and removable by him. Of course, if the Minister saw that the chief executive was not pursuing the objectives for which the new company was set up, he would have the immediate sanction of removing him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained clearly how I see the company being structured and functioning. We do not seek to impose on the Minister at this stage all sorts of clauses, subsections, colons and semicolons, nor even a memorandum of objectives of the company. Our amendments seek to lay out a skeleton of what may be developed at subsequent stages which incorporates those essentials of the accountability, checks and balances that will be needed if the company which is to follow the NFFC is to pursue and obtain the objectives that I am sure all members of the Committee see for it, namely, the, funding and development of British films in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) raised
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
many genuine points about the anxiety felt by other members of the Committee. I stress that the argument being presented is not party political in nature. It is an expression of the genuine concern that is felt by many hon. Members about whether the arrangements, which, astonishingly, seem to have been made before the Bill came to the House of Commons, will be sufficient to achieve the object of the rebirth of a British film industry which makes films for the cinema.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Crowther, generously allowed me to stray slightly, when perhaps I should not, into that area when we were discussing a previous amendment, when I referred, somewhat impolitely, on reflection, to the potential stranglehold of Rank and Thorn EMI. I meant no disrespect to those companies, but if we consider the make-up of the four groups which we are told will be a substantial part of this company, there is no doubt that unless checks and balances are written in, there is potential on the cinema side for Rank, Thorn and EMI to gang up, so to speak, against other genuine film makers for their own advantage. On the other side of the equation, Channel 4 would look, quite rightly, to a priority for making films for Channel 4 which might eventually be shown in the cinema. The priority, however, would be to make films for television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having expressed those worries, let me express to the Minister my hopes about what he will do to make matters clearer. He can make it much clearer to the Committee that the checks and balances will be in the agreement, that there will be a chief executive who will not be overrun by the interests of his board and will be able to protect the genuine needs of British film producers, and that he will have a commitment to ensure that a proportion of his funding goes to minority or experimental film-making. I suggest that the proportion should not be high—I am thinking of 10 per cent., some might think it should be more, and some less. If we are to create a commercially viable cinema industry—here I disagree slightly with the hon. Member for St. Helens, South—we must ensure that we do not cut out opportunities for film makers to join in the company, which is, I hope, designed as the financial flagship of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the financing and investment of the company, I echo the hope of the hon. Member for St. Helens, South that the company will be able to become more public and not merely a closed investment of the four units. I even suggested earlier the possibility that shares might be sold over bank counters, so that the ordinary individual could have a small stake in his hobby, the film industry. This would increase funding and enthusiasm, and generally achieve our purpose. If the Minister cannot persuade me that that will happen or agree to reconsider the clause and bring it back on Report with some adjustments, I must support amendment No. 40 with it insurance factor of the golden share, so that we can in some way control the company's activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Pendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stalybridge and Hyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee proceeds, it becomes clearer that none of us knows what the structure and function of this son of the NFFC is to be. It illustrates the absurdity of the dogmatic approach of the Government to privatisation industry by industry, irrespective of which industry. It has become clear also that some rebels on the Government Benches agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped that the Minister would be a little more flexible. After all, he does not have lightweights behind him. There are the chairman and vice-chairman of his media group and the vice-chairman of the trade and industry group. They are real heavyweights, and there are more of them. It is they who understand the industry. They are the people to whom the Minister should listen, and then be more flexible. The Bill is not his baby, so he can afford to be flexible in the light of having those rebels behind. It is not even his predecessor's Bill; it is a Treasury Bill, as we all know. It is a White Paper rewritten to deal with a Treasury diktat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to the accountability amendments and one particular point which I hope will not appear pedantic. I hope that I may have support from some Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has done a first-class job and everyone in the Committee recognises his talents. He has little flaws here and there which I always note and his perspicacity is at fault when he continues to ask the question: why Thorn EMI, Rank and BVA? If he were to scratch beneath the surface, he would know why. Over the past five years those companies have contributed £232,500 to Conservative party funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem that I am stretching the friendship that I have developed with Conservative Members, but it is true that if the matter were left to a chief executive, who happened to be a friend of the Minister and a member of the Conservative party, there would be no veto. I look for an assurance from the Minister that the £1.5 million that will go to the coffers of the private company from the Government and the £600,000 accruing from the assets of the previous body will not be recycled as a " thank you " to the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is a fair point to make. I should make the same speech if I were on the other side of the Committee. I am sure that those in the industry would want that guarantee too. We must have more accountability and I look to the Minister for an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to shake off some of the shackles around him and come clean. I hope that he will say that our debates have made him more convinced than he was previously, or even say that I was wrong and that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham was going down a different avenue when he asked the question. But it is a relevant question to the accountability argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Grave-sham (Mr. Brinton). I do not want to be misunderstood. While defending the television industry from the rapacious hands of some film directors who look avidly and with increasing interest at the ever full crock of gold of the television industry, I am sympathetic too to the genuine long-term needs of the film industry, and the Bill not meet those needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a reasonable debate in which some pertinent points have been made, mingled with a certain amount of fantasy about whether the son of the NFFC might be converted into a vehicle for making hamburgers or financing the Conservative party—the Conservative party would make a very good film.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that some legitimate points have been raised about precisely what sort of body the son of the NFFC will be and what guarantees and controls the Government will have over it. Although I shall advise my hon. Friends not to support the amendment, I hope that I shall be able to meet most of the points and anxieties that have been expressed. I believe that the intention of many of the amendments is similar to what we have in mind for the son of the NFFC. However, I have reservations about writing in the controls and restrictions, which the amendments would do. Labour Members sometimes seem unable to reconcile themselves to the possibility that another body, especially a private sector body, could carry on the spirit and work of the NFFC without being subject to detailed statutory conditions. I shall try to demonstrate to the Committee that what we have in mind makes that unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been accused of being a little dogmatic. However, dissolution of the NFFC has never been unthinkable. The 1949 legislation made provision for the NFFC to be dissolved by the Treasury if it was satisfied that there was insufficient reason for continuation of the corporation. The Cinematograph Films Act 1957 provided the power to make an arm's length power sale of the NFFC, providing certain conditions were met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had we wanted to privatise or get rid of the NFFC, we could easily have done so under existing legislation. However, forced by the conditions of the Eady levy, we had to think about how the NFFC could be reconstructed and what arrangements could be made that would be helpful to the British film industry. I hope to demonstrate that this is not simply a matter of privatisation because, in addition to the £1.5 million being provided, the Government will be involved with the new body and will continue to have a close relationship and interest with it. That is important to the culture and life of the country. Therefore, the Government will be closely involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 2(6) of the National Film Finance Corporation Act 1981 the NFFC would not be able to make loans or give financial assistance to film production or project development after 1985. That
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
must be borne in mind because the NFFC would have had to be considered then in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the interesting differences in the Bill is the imposition on the son of the NFFC, if it takes over the NFFC's portfolio, of a statutory requirement
	<br><blockquote><p>" that the company will use its best endeavours to encourage the production of "</p></blockquote>
British films. I know that certain reservations were expressed about the words " its best endeavours and I shall come to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the few weeks during which I have been looking after the film industry, as it were, I have had discussions with the prospective participants in the son of NFFC. I have been impressed by the sincerity of their intention that the essentials of the NFFC operation will be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that words are one thing and that hon. Members will wish to know what powers the NFFC participants will have. However, I am sure that the Committee will be interested in the participants' views. I shall go on to describe how we can have some control over what they do and what conditions we can impose upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospective participants told me that they want to continue the essentials of the NFFC. They do not see it as merely a commercial operation but as something that they are doing for the film industry. It is in their long-term interests to strengthen the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will continue to be an emphasis on developing new talent. Low and medium budget films will be supported. They are risky ventures when aimed principally at the cinema rather than television. It is intended that the chief executive should operate with independence, exercising his judgment within the parameters laid down by the partners, very much as the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that some of the over-harsh things which were said about Rank and Thorn EMI were qualified in the debate. Some members of the Committee seemed to have had second thoughts about their previous words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the importance of competition in the exhibition centre, like the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). He was right continually to draw my attention to it. Leaving that important issue aside, it must be recognised that companies such as Rank and Thom EMI have made a great contribution to film making. Rank is not now in film production in this country but it has made some very good films, and so has Thorn EMI. It would be churlish not to acknowledge their distinguished and successful films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members on both sides of the Committee have rightly praised the work of Channel 4. Members of the British Videogram Association include those who are becoming more interested in film production and who have a long-term interest in the health of the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
Apart from ensuring continuity of the NFFC's major functions, the son of the NFFC has the advantage that we intend it to be dynamic, like NFFC, and not static. It will be structured and funded for growth. My hon. Friend the Member for Graves-ham (Mr. Brinton) asked if outsiders, as it were, could participate. The answer is yes, of course. We intend that others should be brought in. To achieve the dynamism of the new body, it is important to keep maximum flexibility so that the company can develop its structure as its operation matures. Apart from the initial prospectus subscribers, others have shown an interest in joining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the Minister said about other persons being able to become subscribers and to join in the venture. Can the Minister say whether the participation by the initial four, and by any subsequent persons in the broader development of the company, will be through the purchase of shares within the company—increasing the capital structure of the shareholding of the company—or through subscription, so that it becomes a company with one share per person with each person paying an annual subscription? I seek not to be hostile but merely to inquire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a definitive answer to that question. It is a matter for continued discussion and negotiation with the existing NFFC, the Government and the four prospective partners. There may not necessarily be any one answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I have interrupted my train of thought, but in passing may I say that the precise nature of the commercial vehicle, whether it be a private or public company, is not finally decided. Coopers and Lybrand is advising the existing NFFC, emphasising the continuity of the link between the NFFC today and the prospective partners, on what mode of vehicle would be most appropriate. Perhaps I shall be able to say more about that on Report. The fact that the vehicle has not been precisely decided upon does not prevent me from trying to demonstrate to the Committee that we shall have substantial influence on the vehicle, whatever precise technical form it takes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not envisage the matter as a closed shop and we should like others to come in. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham talked about shares in the company being available over the counter elsewhere and a possible flotation. I do not rule out either of those possibilities in the longer term but it would be particularly difficult now because in the initial period—I shall go into more detail on that later—I do not believe that it will be, so commercially attractive. That may displease my lion. Friends, although it may assure Opposition Members who are worried that it may be too commercial. As I have said, the four prospective partners are taking a longer-term view and intend that in the first three years the profits should be ploughed back, so no dividends would be paid. That is precisely the point made in one of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Dagenham. If that is their view, it makes it difficult at this stage to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

think about a share flotation or selling shares over the counter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i> rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the intention of the four prospective partners that the profits should be ploughed back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say to my hon. Friend that if the Government were to put some commercially meaningful money into the proposition, his argument would not stand up. It is the lack of commercially helpful sums of money of the size that should be there that endorses his point rather than anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made that point again and again in our debates and I shall not engage in another argument with him now. I shall confine myself to answering the questions raised in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand my hon. Friend's worthy intentions, which sound good, but where is the assurance in the Bill or anywhere else that those intentions will be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to give more detail of the operation that is envisaged. The intention is that initially " son " should aim to part-fund 10 feature films a year, which gives grounds for optimism that it will establish itself as a force in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company will clearly be the channel through which the Government will make advances of 1.5 million each year under clause 4(1)(	<i>a</i>) It will be allowed to use the revenue accruing from the NFFC's envisage that it may also be the agent appointed under clause 4(3) to operate the film project development scheme, which will make available £500,000 a year under clause 4(1)(	<i>b</i>). While it is right that the company should operate as closely as possible to the commercial market, it will be the custodian and trustee on behalf of the Government and indeed the film industry for these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that we have considered it right to safeguard the interests of the public and of the film industry by ensuring that the use of these assets and special assistance will be subject to certain special assistance will be subject to certain conditions. Here I try to answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith). I take the point so often made that Opposition would prefer to have more written down in the Bill; Ministers prefer to have more discretion. That is a familiar argument, but I think that I can point to provisions and powers in the Bill which give us important influences on this body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause (32) allows any conditions to be set for the use of the former NFFC's assets. Clause 3(3), which is concerned with the portfolio, sets out the requirement that the company must use its best endeavours to encourage the production of British films on a commercially successful basis and that it must be willing and able to finance film production. If the portfolio was not used for the purpose for which it had been transferred—namely, to raise significant sums that would then be invested in new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
British film production—the Government would have the power to withdraw the portfolio from the company. Clause 3(3) goes on to stipulate that " son " must be a British company, and the definition of a British company in clause 3(4) defines how the company shall be controlled. Additionally, clause 4(2) provides that any assistance to " son " under clause 4(1)(	<i>a</i>}—that is the £1.5 million a year that we announced in the White Paper—shall also be subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State thinks fit, including one requiring the repayment of grant in specified circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Government have reserved the right, which we intend to exercise, to approve the chairman of " son ", and it is expected that the person appointed by the Secretary of State as the managing director of the existing NFFC will in due course become the chief executive of the new company. The Government will also appoint a director to the board of the new company, who will look after the Government's own investment. He will bear in mind the protection of the former NFFC's film rights and, of course, the interests of the film industry and its different sectors in a much wider sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to emphasise what I think was implicit in what I said earlier about the use of portfolio rights. It is our intention that the income from the portfolio should be used for film development and not distributed as dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that as the Bill is drafted it provides us with considerable influence and powers. We are approving the chairman, we shall appoint the chief executive, and we are providing £1.5 million a year, which we shall not give unless we think that the animal is doing what it is intended to do and what we have agreed with the company will be done. There will be a contract between the Government and the son of the NFFC. We shall be monitoring the scheme to look for the encouragement of new talent or the other objectives to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham referred. I myself have no doubt that the prospective partners intend to do these things, and we shall want to ensure that the money that we have made available is used for the purposes for which we intended it to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) have asked whether the son of the NFFC can be dissolved at a future date. That is a question that I have not yet dealt with. In the light of what has been said in the Committee, I shall consider whether in the contract, or memorandum of understanding, with the son of NFFC and the partners we should write in a condition that the company repay to us moneys advanced to it, or that we have the power to demand that repayment, if it is decided to liquidate the company without the Government's agreement. There is a strong case for such an arrangement. However, even without it, it must surely be apparent that there is a substantial battery of controls designed to ensure that the direction of the new company is in the best interests of the film industry, and does not secure any unfair advantage
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
or influence for individual participants. Fears have been expressed that that could happen, and it is obviously something that we shall have to watch closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In putting forward these safeguards, we have shown that we are aware of the potential problems that hon. Members have identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the Minister yet again, but before he leaves the subject of checks and balances may I ask him whether I understood him to say that the chief executive—not the chairman, the operating man—is to be appointed by the Secretary of State? If that is so, presumably the chief executive would then be answerable to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We would obviously take into account the views of the partners, but in order to provide some continuity we shall have to appoint to the NFFC someone who will become the chief executive. Under the existing legislation we appoint the present managing director of the NFFC. Obviously we shall have to take into the account the views of the others who will be putting money into the venture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened closely to my hon. Friend and I am somewhat encouraged. My hon. Friend has talked about a memorandum of understanding into which all the provisions will be written. Is a memorandum of understanding legally enforceable by the Government? I am not an expert on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. It is a contract. I turn now to the specific amendments. Amendment No. 11 requires " son " to invest in films, or to make available money totalling its income from the potrfolio of rights. I have already detailed the arrangements, and I am sure that Labour Members will understand that I do not wish to accept an amendment writing them in. I believe that the spirit of the amendment is already well satisfied in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 12 seeks to remove the requirement that the new company should have regard to commercial considerations in encouraging the production of relevant films, with the Opposition's preference being for the NFFC. The hon. Member for St. Helens, South raised this question. I remind him and other hon. Members that section 2 of the National Film Finance Corporation Act 1981 already says this about the NFFC. I quote the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"make loans to persons who, in the judgment of the Corporation, have reasonable expectations of being able to arrange for the production or distribution of films on a commercially successful basis."</p></blockquote>
The Bill echoes what is there and what has been there since the NFFC was set up in 1949.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the 1981 Act says. Would the Minister not agree that the 1981 Act was not as harsh in its wording as the present Bill, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>" relevant films on a commercially successful basis "?</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
The 1981 Act referred to persons who had reasonable expectations; in other words there was an element of good faith on the part of the applicant for the fund. As the Bill is drafted it does not have the broadness of good faith of the 1981 Act, which allowed avant-garde and experimental films to be financed. It could be argued—this is what I seek to avoid—that funding offered by " son " to films of that nature might well be restricted by the current wording of the clause. I understand what the Minister seeks to do and I suggest in the friendliest way possible that the wording should be redrafted to reflect to a greater extent the 1981 position. That would allay one of my worries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rather fine point. The clause uses the phrase " best endeavours " where the 1981 Act used " reasonable expectations ". I see the direction in which the hon. Gentleman's argument goes but he is expressing a shade of opinion rather than a hard point. The words " commercially successful " go back to 1949.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 deals with the appointment of an independent director. I have already said that we intend that there should be a Government director who will be specifically charged with considering the interests of the industry as a whole, which, I imagine, would cover the independent director's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 14 seeks to make the encouragement of new film makers the main objective of the new company. I agree that that is extremely important. There has been universal praise of the NFFC for what it has done in that area. As I have already told the Committee, in our discussions with the proposed participants in " son " both we and they were in complete agreement on the important objective of encouraging the emergence of new film makers. That is what the participants had in mind when they said that it was not a commercial venture in the short term but something that would have a spin off for the industry as a whole and would therefore be in our longer term interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to accept an amendment which makes that the main objective as that goes a bit far although it is an important objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Helens, South spoke about amendment No. 15 and the role of the chief executive. I have already said that the prospective partners have made it clear that the style described by the hon. Gentleman—the chief executive having delegated authority, operating within parameters and exercising his judgment—is very much the style they expect the new company to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 36 provides that a shareholding must be transferred to the Secretary of State, carrying with it
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>" the power of veto on any decisions made by the company in pursuance of the conditions specified in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>).</p></blockquote>
To accept any such provision would perhaps make life unworkable for the Son. I feel that the amendment would impose requirements even more rigorous than those placed on chairmen of nationalised industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
Amendment No. 40 proposes the retention by the Secretary of State of a special or golden share. Following what I have said about the conditions that will attach to advances of money to the company, and about what I shall consider writing into the contract between Government and partners, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North will find that his amendment is unnecessary. Our objectives are surely the same. The Government will have considerable influence over the company. I agree with my hon. Friend that it would be a good thing if we could sell shares in it, but that is somewhat unlikely to happen in the first couple of years or so. Nevertheless, it could be pursued in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have attempted to answer the real anxieties put to hon. Members, and I assure them that we intend to monitor what happens to the company. We have a battery of instruments for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not yet dealt with the phrase " best endeavours ". That phrase is the subject of the next amendment, but if the Committee would like me to deal with it now, I shall do so. It is used for a purely practical reason. Although the schedule definies a British film, the definition is quite complicated. Labour costs are involved, for instance. Things do not always turn out as they were intended. Sometimes locations have to be changed; sometimes the actors are not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some complicated disputes with my Department. I am told that when the film "Zulu" was being made there was a great argument over whether the title allowed the film to be called British. It was discovered that the Zulus —they were not being paid very much, but they were being fed, and that contributed to the labour costs—were South African, and therefore did not count towards the British content of the film. It was decided that the way round the problem was to use Swazi actors. However, they were 2 ft. shorter, and did not exactly resemble the tribal warriors whom the film was intended to depict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end my officials flexible as ever—found a way of dealing with the difficulty. However, because such disputes have arisen so often, we have cautiously put in the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>" intended … to be a British film ".</p></blockquote>
As I said earlier, no such obligation was placed—even in that rather watery form—on the original NFFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge hon. Members not to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has left the Committee in some difficulty, although I am sure that that was not intentional. I fully accept that the purpose of his remarks was to help the Committee, and indeed they have done so. But have they helped us enough?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was clear from his remarks that the Minister understood the doubts and anxieties about the successor body which I think are felt on both sides of the Committee, and he went a long way towards meeting some of the anxieties that we had expressed. I particularly welcomed what he said about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
the appointments of a chairman, a chief executive and a director, and about what would happen if the company were dissolved in a short period. Those remarks were all helpful, and I would not like it to be thought that we viewed them in any churlish manner. It is gratifying that the Minister has moved in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that once the Bill passes out of our hands we shall have no further opportunity, at least in the foreseeable future, of ensuring that what we think is important will be included and enforceable. It is no personal reflection on the Minister to say that he well knows that neither his remarks in Committee nor in any other debate will carry the force of law in the interpretation of the eventual Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased to know what the Minister is thinking, so that if what eventually emerges differs from what he said we shall be able to say, in a political sense, " What the Minister said would happen has not materialised." But that will be of little comfort to the film industry because there will be nothing which will enable us or anybody else to go to the courts or any other forum and say that the successor body has transgressed and has failed to meet the conditions which the Minister said should be laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly said, " I intend to enter into a legally binding contract. I shall therefore have the option of enforcing the terms of the contract. Under the Bill as drafted I shall have the option of specifying and imposing certain conditions and then enforcing conditions which are not fulfilled." That does not meet the point that we need to have some knowledge of the mechanisms written into the Bill so that there is someing that we can get hold of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly draws attention to the reasons for the somewhat loose drafting of clause 3(3). We shall no doubt look at this matter again under amendment No. 17. The problem does not just rest in phrases such as
	<br><blockquote><p>" will use its best endeavours"</p></blockquote>
or
	<br><blockquote><p>" is willing and able ",</p></blockquote>
although it is worth remarking that, as the Minister recognises, those loose terms impose nothing which would be easily identified as an obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem is that, although the Minister spoke of a statutory requirement being imposed on the company, the clause as drafted does not appear to do so. I shall be grateful if the Minister will look at that matter again. The Minister is required to be satisfied about certain matters. The Minister rightly said that he has a wide discretion, not only under that provision but under the opportunity given to him to impose conditions, but no obligation is imposed on the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company, as I said in an intervention during our last sitting, could make no statements of any sort. It could remain totally silent on all matters. It might simply say, " We hope that the Minister,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
without offering him any undertaking, will be satisfied that we shall use our best endeavours, but we give him no assurances. Indeed, there is nothing in the Bill which will make us do that." There is no way in which any person active in the British film industry could say that the company had failed to meet the conditions. For those reasons we still appear to lack the necessary element of legal enforceability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public money is involved. The Minister made some play of the £2 million a year plus the £600,000 derived from public assets which will be at the disposal of the company. It is therefore important that we as legislators and our successors should have some control over that money. A general principle should be established in the legislation as to how these sums should be disposed of. No possibility of accountability has been written into the Bill and thus we cannot call on the company to account for its use of that public money. That remains an important matter, because unless something of that sort is written into the Bill the question, which agitated my hon. Friends earlier, remains: why single out this company? Why not choose a different company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to agree entirely with the allegations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry), but with the clause as drafted, it is quite possible for this company—singled out for no good reason, as far as one can tell—to dispose of any rights that are transferred to it by the Secretary of State and to retain any sums accruing there from. That is perhaps relevant to the debate at our last sitting about the commercial value of those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left in a difficult position. We know that the Minister sees our problem, but we are not satisfied that he has yet done enough to put something into the Bill that will provide a mechanism in which we can have some confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, clause 3(3) says that the Secretary of State may, if he wishes,
	<br><blockquote><p>" arrange for the right to be transferred … to any British company in whose case he is satisfied "</p></blockquote>
as to the matter that concerns the hon. Gentleman. In other words, the Secretary of State, if inquiring into the wrong intentions of this company, could take away those rights and give them to somebody else better suited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Certainly, there is no shortage of powers for the Secretary of State in the clause. However, we have to relate those powers to what will happen in the real world and the possible development—or, looking at it pessimistically, the likely development—of this company over the next three years. After three years, it will be possible for the company to say, "Well, this didn't work. We have spent all the money, and there is no viable future for the British film industry." My fear is that, by that time, whoever appears at the Dispatch Box—I make no predictions about that at this stage—may well say, " We tried, but it failed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
We cannot place too much reliance on a leisurely development whereby the Government try one thing first and, if that does not work, try something else. Of course, the Minister has powers to do that, but we want to make sure that over the next three years the company makes proper use of its resources and facilities. We want the company to have an obligation—nothing too tightly drawn or onerous, but something that imposes on the company an obligation to use these resources in the interests of the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explore the possible effectiveness, as he sees it, of the memorandum of understanding about which we heard a moment ago from my hon. Friend the Minister, when he said that that would, in fact, be a contract?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to that issue. The memorandum of understanding is a rather curious term, and it was useful to have it established that it would be a legally binding contract. Governments enter into legally binding contracts by the thousand every day of the week, but such contracts do not necessarily establish the principles that, in my view, should be contained in the Bill. Many commercial pressures, discretion, and so on, operate on Governments dealing in contracts, as commercial agents. We want to make sure that some basic obligation is defined in the Bill, so that the private company put forward as the new body to fulfil the role of the old NFFC at least has an obligation imposed on it to do something in the public interest, as opposed to its own commercial interest. That is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, in conclusion, that we are driven back to the central issue of the Bill? The problem is that a private commercial company is to fulfil a role which hitherto most people in the industry have felt could properly be undertaken only by a body with some public functions and responsibilities. If the Bill says nothing about that, it will be extremely difficult to ensure that the private company will have that public element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of the Bill, consonant with the Minister's plans for the industry and with what we see from the Government's legislative intentions, it is intended to hand over virtually the whole future of the industry to market forces in a market which, as many hon. Members will agree, does not operate as a free market. Because of the contradiction between private commercial interests and the desirable public role of the successor company, we need something of that element written into the Bill. I welcome all that the Minister said about his intentions, but I hope that he wilt concede that the Bill is too loosely drafted and that something a little more substantial than a token or earnest of intention is needed so that everyone knows what the successor body is meant to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
the Minister has travelled towards Damascus since we started. I am sure that all members of the Committee will be most grateful to him. However, he has not yet reached the holy city. His enlightenment is encouraging, even if it is not overwhelming. We are grateful for promises of the mercies that he has offered. There may not have been a complete conversion, but we have got some way towards it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite your correction, Mr. Crowther, it is unsatisfactory to start a journey and give up before it ends. It is sad and unsatisfactory for those who are taking the journey, but it is also unsatisfactory for those who are awaiting the arrival of the traveller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, may I interpret it for my hon. Friend the Minister? There remain loose ends—unanswered questions. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) referred to the lack of legal enforceability. I would put it differently. I greatly welcome my hon. Friend's assurance that the contract will encapsulate what must be done by those who form the company. However, until we know the terms of the contract, we are not sufficiently far ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the Minister will appoint the chairman. I am glad that the Minister will be involved in the appointment of the chief executive. I am also very grateful that there will be a Government-appointed director. However, I do not know yet what the powers of that director will be. Can he be outvoted? How will the Government judge whether any of the assurances are being broken? When will the Government know that undertakings within the contract have been broken? Will it be after the event, when nothing can be done about it? All those matters still require clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they have sanctions which they can impose. The Government can withdraw the availability of the NFFC's assets. However, by then, those assets might have been sucked dry. The Government might be acting after the event. Moreover, action to withdraw Government funding might be taken only after money had been spent. If both of those situations arose, what would be the position of independent film makers, who would then have no vehicle through which their interests could be furthered? The Government would have taken out their funds and removed the assets of the NFFC. Nothing would be left for the independent film makers. Therefore, a new structure would have to be created. There are other questions too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that what the Minister has said about the vehicle and the controls in the memorandum is a bit like giving an alcoholic a bottle of whisky and saying to him, " Now, you have told me that you are reformed and that you are going to be a good boy.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Gentleman down that path. My analogies today are biblical. But he may have a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if one or more pillars of the new company drop out or do not participate at some stage in the new company's life? How firmly committed will the founding fathers be? The Minister said that there would be sufficient funds for 10 films a year. How will those 10 films be financed out of the budget? That question is not strictly relevant to the amendments, but as the Minister mentioned the budget, I should like clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I heard the Minister say that the 10 films would be partly funded. If we work on an average of £400,000 per film on 10 medium budget cinema features, costing in total between £2 million and £5 million, the budget or part-funding does not seem to be sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he has made the point even more forcibly than I did. We are encouraged because the Minister has moved a long way towards the city of such reverence. To me the word of the hon. Member for Dagenham, we should be " churlish " if we did not give my hon. Friend the Minister credit for his understanding of the problems which the amendments raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister tells the nation the terms and conditions under which the new company is to be governed and we find later that they are inadequate, it will be too late for us to table amendments requiring there to be a special share. Everyone is familiar with the procedures of the House. If an amendment is rejected in Committee, there is no machinery by which we can nut it back again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I implore my hon. Friends, in the hope that the Opposition might be similarly disposed, to accept amendment No. 40 and await the Government's statement. If all is satisfactory, I shall move its deletion from the Bill on Report. That seems entirely reasonable. I hope that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon.

I heartily endorse—I cannot speak for my hon. Friends as we have not consulted on the matter—the proposition made by the hon. Member for Hendon, North in his closing remarks, and I intend to vote for amendment No. 40 on the basis that he outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
First, I take up the matter of the Government's contribution to the new body, which has been referred to. To many of us, a major failing in all that the Government have told us about the son of the NFFC during our proceedings, particularly on this set of amendments, is the inadequacy of the amount of money that it is envisaged will go from this new body into the production and promotion of film. In the light of the Committee's earlier discussions about other sources of funds for the film industry, I had hoped that the Minister would come forward with some assurances about the funds to be made available to the new body. The seed money that it is envisaged will come from the new body for new film production must attract private finance. The essential point is that that seed money must have sufficient force to attract the funds required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) put the point extremely well. If a film with a budget of £3 million, £4 million or £5 million is to have sufficient seed money from the new NFFC body to attract investment from the private banking or investing sector it has to be more than the amount at present envisaged by the Minister. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will tell us more about the available resources and how they will be deployed as seed money for the promotion of new films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham made a major point when he talked about the Committee's dilemma. I am sure that the Minister has the new body's future role and benefit in mind, but it is difficult to rely on the intentions of the present Minister and to be reassured that something will be legislated and put in black and white. I am sure that Committee Members will appreciate the Opposition's dilemma in the face of the Government's reluctance to write anything in to the Bill to give legal force to their assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be extremely helpful if the Minister could, before Report, table some details of the envisaged contract between the Government and the new company, so that we can be clearer about the legal obligations placed on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, I wish to press the Minister a little further on the role of the company's chief executive. I welcome the statement that he will operate independently, although—I believe that this is what the Minister said—within parameters laid down by the partners to the body. But we need greater clarification about how genuine the chief executive's independence will be. I am glad that the Minister envisages, in his words, transferring the chief executive of the existing NFFC to that position in the new company. I hope that I understood him correctly. Again, I welcome the fact that the Government will have to approve the chairman of the new body and that they will appoint a director of the company deliberately with the public interest in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a number of questions immediately arise. First, who will the other directors of the company be? What will their powers be and will they be able to outvote the Government-appointed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
director? If those other directors are entirely beholden to the private interests which have put money into the company, we are justified in worrying about the board's decision-making powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what would happen if there were a conflict between the chief executive and the members of the board? It may be that he, acting with independence and, as he believes, in the public interest, disagrees with a decision made by a board that is. largely composed of members appointed by private interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I am disappointed that the Minister has not felt able to go further in giving us a guarantee of a statutory basis for the chief executive's independence. It does not matter who appoints the chief executive, or who goes on to the board or is chairman if, in the day-to-day practical process of running the body and disposing of the funds to which it has access, there is a dispute and we do not know who will be the arbiter of the chief executive's actions and independence. Those are my main worries, and I hope that the Minister will go a little farther along the road to Damascus and perhaps even on to Jerusalem!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was heartened when the Minister referred to the film " Zulu " as an example and I noted the ability of his civil servants to stretch and bend. I wonder whether he still had his rack in his Ministry because we may be able to stretch and bend his undertakings a little more. I am well aware that Ministers do not like certain matters to be written into Bills but prefer to give broad undertakings which may or may not be adhered to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the natural right of the Opposition to be faintly suspicious. I am not suggesting that we are suspicious of the Minister because it seems to me that as the weeks stretch by his comprehension and knowledge of the film industry grows appropriately and I congratulate him on that. As I said earlier, his repeated assurances that he has the interests of the film industry at heart have been written into 	<i>Hansard</i> and the more that that is done the more we can flay him with it later should he let us down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a naturally suspicious man but I am always a little wary when someone, whether in the House, the commercial world or the professional world, says to me, " We are going to draw the document in this way and put down the terms and memorandum in this form." Perhaps I am overly suspicious, but between intention and writing things sometimes slip and what ultimately gets written is not what earlier appeared would be written. I do not suggest that the Minister would seek to renege on his words of this morning, now so carefully recorded in 	<i>Hansard,</i> about the matters that will be in the contract. I understand the word " memorandum " to mean a contract which is legally binding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Minister nods in assent. However, I am a little worried because we do not know—which is why I pressed the point
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
earlier—the nature of construction of this vehicle. Is it to be, perhaps, a limited partnership? I am sure that the Minister or his colleagues will understand the legal technicalities that I invoke by asking whether the matter is to be termed under the 1890 Act or the concept of limited partnerships between limited companies, and so on, because, of course, there is a world of legal differences in those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I am a cautious man, and not knowing the nature of the vehicle that is to be constructed, we need a safeguard. I am sure that the overwhelming wish of the Committee is that the new body should reflect fully the assurances that we have been given today. As a cautious man, I like to keep a longstop and the only one possible under our procedures would be to have an amendment to the Bill at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) rightly said that such an amendment could be withdrawn on Third Reading once we had seen the outline of the vehicle and had been reassured that the nature of the controls—I do not use that word in a tough sense—and the terms of the agreement were in accordance with what had been the overwhelming wish of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I openly associate myself entirely with amendment No. 40 on the terms given by the hon. Gentleman—that when we were satisfied, it would be removed at a later stage. In doing so, I do not wish the Minister to think that I doubt in any way the validity and good faith of his assurances, but that would act as a spur to getting the matter tidied up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee one other danger on the horizon. Once the new arrangements are made, there will be a temptation for us merely to let the idea meander through and there will be no pressure to complete the contract. The Bill will have passed through the House but the arrangements will not have been fully entered into, and we shall have no way of saying, " That is not in accordance with the assurances." For that reason, I urge hon. Members to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that I owe it to my hon. Friend the Minister to speak again, albeit briefly. I said that I would listen carefully to his arguments, and that I have done. As a result, I feel impelled to remind him, with respect, that on his own admission he has been consorting closely with the film industry for only a matter of weeks. I have been involved in the film and television industry for about 34 years, in different ways. I love it and the people in it dearly. But the one thing that I have learnt throughout the years is that if it is not made plain on paper exactly what a contract is about, one is in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister has shown that his intentions are correct. He will have a memorandum of understanding which, somewhat quickly, turned into a contract which will be legally enforceable. But he is unable to confirm at this stage what will be in the contract, perhaps for the good reason that it is still being negotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
When contracts are negotiated, terms can change. Therefore if the Committee did not try to put in the safety catch of amendment No. 40, we would hardly be saying that we have great faith in my hon. Friend the Minister, which, most assuredly, my hon. Friends and I have. But faith is not enough in negotiations with the film and television industry. We must have more. We must know that it will be accepted and that the Government will not run away from appointing a director. We must know, not just hope or have faith. We must know all the details of the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that I hoped that my hon. Friend might concede that the clause needs a little attention before Report—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend has views about what the contract should contain. Does he agree that one of the important aspects is to know what is being told to people who bid for the shareholding about how it will be widened and the terms and timescale. What are his views on that? My hon. Friend the Minister has not spelt that out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. We need to know whether the Minister's hope that the company will be able to have investors widely drawn into it, instead of only the four organisations at present proposed, will be realised. We need to know what would happen—boardroom revolutions do take place—if the board of Rank and Thorn EMI altered overnight and the opinions of the chairman or chief executive of that company changed. The Minister has said that he could withdraw the Government's portfolio if there was something of which he disapproved. But is not more reassurance needed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is a golden share more powerful than the portfolio of rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that the golden share is more powerful, any more than did my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). What we do suggest, nakedly and unashamedly, is that until we are given some detail of the contract, which I understand the Minister is currently negotiating, we need the golden share as a safety catch until Report. We are not interested in perpetuating the golden share provided we receive reassurances later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to understand that the withdrawal of funds or assets of the NFFC would bring about a collapse. The existence of a golden share, as in British Lion, enabled the director to have a veto. He could say whether to go along a particular road and take action to keep the show together. That is why it is so much more valuable and important than my hon. Friend the Minister suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The importance of the golden share and all the other ramifications are such that I must ask my hon. Friend the Minister why he is so reassured that the average funding by the new son of NFFC—I generously quoted £400,000 but I suggest that it is less per film—will be sufficient to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
pull in other high-risk investment in order to build the British film industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recall that a series of finance houses and financial institutions were approached by ACCT to obtain their views on the levels of seed funding that the Government intended to make through the new company? Without exception, all said that the amounts envisaged by the Government were insufficient for them to risk their private capital on film production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always careful about the use of the words " seed funding " because it means different things to different people. A sum of £400,000 per film in a project of this sort is only marginally better than the BBC's claim to produce seed funding which, I think, amounts to about £200,000 in total. That is minute and has nothing to do with financing the production of feature films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will listen to the frequently repeated statements of people who know, such as Goldcrest, independent producers and many others, who see the need for a fund to be created of about £15 million or £20 million in order to attract extra investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not tempt my hon. Friend the Minister up the same path as the Boulting brothers who said that considerably higher sums of £50 million, £60 million and even £80 million were required. But £15 million or £20 million would produce a fund which would attract the attention of City and foreign investors and would make a high risk investment a little less of a risk and, therefore, viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened closely to my hon. Friend the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister talked about a Government-appointed chairman, chief executive and a director. What will be their relationship? They may be in a minority even when matters are head counted at board meetings. Will the Government-appointed director take a passive or an active part? That is important. What will be the relationship between the Government-appointed director and the chairman, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is taking me back to an earlier speech. Will the Government-appointed director have a veto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apparently not, as my hon. Friend the Minister shakes his head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a power of veto would be carrying the matter too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point is extremely important. If it is the case that none of the Government appointees will have an entrenched position, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to understand how that position can be sustained if there is no statutory back-up and they can be out-voted on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Briton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. I was talking earlier about another way of doing that by ensuring that powers for the chief executive are very broad—almost total. I spoke of benevolent dictatorship and the fact that the entertainment industry is not well served by committee management. It is better served by one person's decision. If that decision becomes questionable at the right appeal level, that person must be charged. I suggest that that appeal level that should be at Governmental level, rather than the board of son of NFFC, which will presumably be made up of two specific commercial companies—a television company and the British Videogram Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to protect the British film industry and give it rebirth and energy. My hon. Friend the Minister has often said that the industry is thriving or is not as ill as some of us have suggested. He seems to base that opinion on those two splendid films, "Chariots of Fire" and " Ghandi ", but we are not making enough films in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend moves on to successful films, may I ask him to concentrate further on the question I asked. I am concerned that we have not been told the precise formation of the new company. Will it be a public company or a private company? I understand that company directors are responsible to shareholders and only shareholders. If there is a special share, one director will have a special relationship with a shareholder. However, at the moment that is not spelt out and we do not have the contract, so how does my hon. Friend see the operation in terms of protecting the proposals in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a different way my hon. Friend expressed my fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in his memorandum of agreement my hon. Friend the Minister is organising what I, in my amateur way, describe as a private company. But he devoutly hopes that at a certain stage it will go public and that other shareholders will be allowed to bid for shares and enter the investment. I devoutly hope that too. However, is that the right way to start with what, a moment ago, I described as the flagship of the financing of British films? Should not we perhaps start with a more embracing investment? Perhaps in his negotiations with the four bodies concerned my hon. Friend the Minister might consider whether they would accept that a wider shareholding would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those points mean that the safety catch suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North is essential if we are to retain any control between now and the later stages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, let me tell my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), that money is important but it is a separate issue. The amendments deal with whether the Government will have control of the money that they are investing and influence on the new body. I understand the deep feeling of my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham which is shared
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorso. However, that is not what the debate is about. It is about the nature of the animal and the influence which the Government will have on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, I do not believe that what my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North said about the money is an argument for the golden share route because the money is part of the Government's policy and that will not be changed. We shall continue to argue about it. I understand that there are genuine worries but we are discussing the Government's relationship to this body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we should bear in mind that we shall be replacing a statutory body by a private body. Much of the argument has proceeded on the assumption that it was not a private body and that we could write in conditions that would go well beyond those which a private body could reasonably expect. In some respects they go well beyond those that statutory and other public sector corporations have to observe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time it is not true, as the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) said, that the Government's attitude is to leave it to the free market. We have acknowledged from the beginning of our debates that it is not a free market. Important points have been made about competition. It can hardly be called a free market solution when the Government will continue to put in money and have an influence on the appointment of the chief executive, the chairman and the directors. That is a long way from Friedmanite economics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister conceded at the begining of our debate that he was going to go through an educative process and that there was to be a learning curve. I am delighted to see that the Minister is making progress along that curve. The Opposition have felt justified in drawing attention to the reliance which the Government appear to be placing on private market forces. We have been able to point to successive statements by some o the hon. Gentleman's colleagues on Second Reading debates and in White Papers, all of which show clearly that that is what the Government believe they are doing. If confirmation were required, one need turn only to the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of the Second Reading debate, in which the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier), the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, talked about relieving the industry from the debilitation of subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He talked also about relieving it from many of the controls, such as the quotas and the Eady levy. There are certain controls that the industry needed and wanted to be rid of and we have swept them away. In that sense the rhetoric is right. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that I am learning. I said, modestly and accurately, that I did not know as much as some of my hon. Friends about the industry and that I looked forward to the Committee and intended to learn, as I knew that I would. I knew, too, that I should learn more from some than from others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham made much of the point that no obligation is written into the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
and imposed precisely on the son of the NFFC. I repeat that we are replacing a statutory body by a private body. However, the Secretary of State must satisfy himself that the body to which he is transferring assets and giving money is acting in a certain way. The Secretary of State is accountable to the House of Commons and the Public Accounts Committee for how money is spent. That is formidable when allied to the weapons available to him to influence that body. The House of Commons, through the Secretary of State, will be able to see whether we are carrying out our policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Secretary of State give satisfactory explanations to the House of Commons and to others when he requires that the company will use its best endeavours to encourage the production of commercially successful films? My hon. Friend mentioned this morning that he thinks that about 10 films a year will be made. How can there be about 10 commercially successful films when they are so grossly under-financed, as they inevitably will be, on the funds available to the undertaking? That should be coupled with a question about what the Government director on the board will be doing in deciding what will, or will not, be " commercially successful". Will he be there as a dumb idiot—if I may be grossly rude to him before he takes up his post—to ensure that certain nitty-gritty points of contract are observed but making no other contribution? Can my hon. Friend expand a little of the role of the Government director in his relation to " commercially successful " films?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase " commercially successful " echoes previous legislation. The hon. Member for Dagenham may say that the films will not be commercially successful. Indeed, that requirement was written into the NFFC legislation. It is true, unfortunately, that not many of the NFFC's films were commercially successful. That point is significant. Writing fine phrases into legislation is a different matter from making things happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still trying to answer the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North, who then reverted to the question of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was precisely on the meaning of commercially successful " that I wished to intervene. Does the Minister accept that there is a major difference between writing into legislation relating to the National Film Finance Corporation an indication that it should try to make commercially successful films, where it is clear from the structure, composition, role and function of that organisation that it is fulfilling a public purpose in the public sector, and providing that it should not disregard the commercial success of the projects that it undertakes, because that is a major factor? As for the new body that is defined in the Bill, it is non-existent; it is a will-o'-the-wisp. It is simply required to take account of commercial considerations; that is what we find difficult. We are not saying that commercial considerations should not come into, the matter, but we are saying that there is no counter-balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is Government influence, money and policy. I accept that my words do not have the force of law, but they represent the Government's policy. As has been said, that policy has had a certain continuity. What I have said has been reflected in Government policy for some time and the Bill reflects what is in the White Paper. As I have said repeatedly, the Government are anxious that we should have a successful and flourishing film industry. I have outlined to the Committee what we intend for the son of the NFFC and that reflects the Government's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North raised again the question of money. I tried to explain to my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham that the question of money, which keeps intruding, is separate from the principle that is rightly being debated in this group of amendments. The money, as my hon. Friend described it, will not be used differently from the way that it was used by the NFFC. After all, the NFFC's budget was half that which will be available to its son and was used to part-fund films. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North shakes his head, but that statement is true. The amount of money being made available to the son of the NFFC is double that which the NFFC had. So even though it will have more money, it will want to use it in the same way for part-funding, trying to act as a catalyst and persuading the markets to put up more money. I understand that what my hon. Friend is saying is part of a wider debate about the tax regime and capital allowances, for example, but in the context of this debate about the NFFC, the resources that are being made available are double those that were available before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend, perhaps for the last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend who is being very patient. In answer to the first part of my question he said something which troubled me. He said that the special director of the Government would be concerned with carrying out Government policy. We all know that Government policy can change, and immediately a question is raised in my mind. For how long will this director be appointed? Will it be for the pleasure of the Government, for a fixed term or until there is a change of Government? Will there be continuity in this director? After all, he may come to represent the Government on one policy and the Government's policy may change. He may change his mind or he may wish to stick to it. He might even say " I'll resign ". What is his status? Is he an independent agent or is he totally a messenger of the Government of the day—and a policy of the day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will not be there to carry out policy, but he will be appointed by the Government and he will have regard to the wider interests of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has asked a very pertinent question and I am aware that I have not given him as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
full an answer as he would like. I shall endeavour on Report to give the House of Commons more details, including details of what we have in mind in the contract between ourselves and the prospective partners in the son of the NFFC. I cannot say that I will place the contract before the House of Commons or announce all the details, because I do not know what the time scale is or when the Bill will be considered on Report, but I shall certainly attempt to give more details. I tried to move in response to my hon. Friend's concerns when I said that I would consider writing into the Bill whether we could recover money from some of the partners if we felt that the conditions had not been met. I could not go any further than that as that was something that I thought of in response to what my hon. Friend had said. Again, I shall give more details of that on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have resisted the temptation to intervene until this moment. I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for the assurances that he has given this morning, which go a long way to satisfying my concerns. I do not share my hon. Friend's fears over the funding of the industry. I do not believe that it is the Government's job to fund the industry, and I have made that plain before. Nor do I believe that the figure of £400,000 per film is likely to be the bottom line. If the clause that we put into the Bill last week to raise a levy on television screenings stands, as I hope it will, a considerably greater sum might be available. I hope that it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, may I ask for a further degree of assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister. He said that were the company to be wound up against the wishes of the Secretary of State or the Government, the money would be withdrawn. Will he take that a stage further and say that if the company fails to satisfy the conditions laid down by the Secretary of State—for example, that it will use its best endeavours to produce " relevant " films, whatever they are, on a commercially successful basis—he will also withdraw the Government funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I would give consideration to that point. I am interested in trying to persuade people to remain as investors in this body. So many conditions are being imposed on me to impose on them that I am being beginning to get a little anxious. However, I have tried to move in my hon. Friend's direction. I shall consider these matters, and I shall certainly make a statement to the House of Commons on Report. This is a question for negotiation between my Department, myself and the prospective partners. If I had not had to be here defending and explaining the Bill, I might have been able to get on with negotiating the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can say that I have found no disagreement or difficulty between myself and the prospective partners on the matters on which I have been speaking, but rather total acceptance of them. I am not having to impose requirements on them, they are accepted. The issue of the Government director is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
accepted. I do not envisage difficulties because the partners share our aspirations—and I think those of the Committee—for the son of the NFFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and apologise for interrupting the Committee. My anxiety is that the Government can withdraw the financing that they have put into NFFC. My hon. Friend has gone a long way towards answering the fears that I expressed at our previous sitting. However, I would like an assurance that the Government intend to continue to support the British film industry, should the new body fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go further than we have gone at different stages of the debate. My hon. Friend is opening up an entirely new area of argument. I am trying to respond to the question whether we need a golden share in the son of the NFFC and to arguments about its conditions and relationships with Government. I cannot give a commitment that goes beyond that which I have already given. I must tell my hon. Friend that quite openly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have demonstrated to the Committee—I think also that my hon. Friends know this in their heart of hearts—that the Government will have a great deal of leverage over the son of the NFFC. I do not believe that the insertion of the golden share will increase that. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North is trying to press his amendment for a tactical reason for he wants us to return to these issues on Report. I shall return to these issues in Committee and make a statement about them anyway, and therefore, it is unnecessary on tactical grounds for him to press the amendment. I believe that the golden share would have no greater force than the other levers that we shall have on the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North referred to the golden share in British Lion. He certainly knows all about the history of British Lion, and I have done some swotting up on it myself. It is true that the golden share prevented some things from happening, but it did not prevent some adjustments being made to British Lion and some realities having to be faced. The mere insertion of a golden share does not guarantee anything. It may give some influence for a time, but if the company is in deep trouble the golden share will not enable it to escape from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be well aware that the rattle of gold has a great effect on commercial people, and if it were in the Bill he could rattle the gold between now and the Report. He says that he is finding no difficulties with the various parties. If they know that this little golden share is in the wings, surely they will be that much more compliant towards his reasonable demands. We want to reinforce him, not to weaken him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A golden share—just one share—is not in itself necessarily worth anything. What is worth much more is the portfolio of rights and the £1.5 million, the Government's approval of those and the legally enforceable contract. All those re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
quirements seem to have more force than the one my hon. Friend proposes in his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an interesting debate. Some important questions have been raised and I shall return to them on Report. I shall certainly give more details to the Committee but I do not think that there are intrinsically sound arguments for a golden share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee must again record its gratitude to the Minister for considering so carefully so many matters and, indeed, for showing a real flexibility and open mindedness. It is perhaps poor reward to him that those very qualities encourage the Committee, at least the Opposition Members, to press him a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is offering to give the Committee more detail about the contract on Report and to consider writing something into the Bill about what might happen if the company went out of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That strengthens my point. If that is not what the Minister is offering, it is what he should be offering. Rather than waiting until Report for some detail of the negotiations which he has been conducting with the various bodies which are involved, and on the assumption that we do not conclude our debate by one o'clock today, could not the Minister reconsider this limited but important technical point before our next sitting? It is the point that separates us at present. Basically, the Opposition and many Conservative Members who have spoken in the debate are on all fours with the Minister. We understand what he wants to do and we agree with it. However, we are not yet satisfied that the mechanisms he has chosen are sufficient to achieve his objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crucial point that the Minister seems to be missing is that whereas we understand that the contract between the Government and the son will be a legally enforceable document, we need to know the nature of the body with which it is to be made. The hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) made a valid point. He and I may disagree politically most of the time but I recognise his argument. Is this body to be a constructed body, a limited company which would be open to wider participation than the principal four, or is it, as I suggested to the Minister, to be a limited partnership? The Minister has not responded on that important point. Such bodies are very different and we need to hear from him on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The memory of the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) is for once deficient. I said that the nature of the corporate vehicle was the subject of a study being conducted jointly for the NFFC and the prospective partners and that a definitive answer had not yet been reached. I did reply to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the Minister will recognise that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) was on a slightly different point. It is an important point which I had intended to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
come to myself. There is the question about the form the successor body should take, which we expect the Minister eventually to be able to answer. But there is a preliminary question to which my hon. Friend was referring: as the Minister is inviting the Committee to place all its reliance on a contract which he will conclude, we have to know with which body it is to be concluded. Is it to be concluded with the new company? If that is the case, the Minister will be pulling himself up by his bootstraps to get into the contract the appointment of directors and all the other undertakings he expects to obtain from it. Or, is the new contract to be made not with the new company but with the constituent bodies? If
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
that is the case, it is hard to see quite how the new body is to be limited by the contract since it will not be a party to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South has identified an important technical point which the Minister has not yet thought through and we need an answer. We are not divided by the substance as we are virtually agreed on what we expect the new body to undertake by way of commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
