	<p> [Mr. STAN CROWTHER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Films Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) wishes to raise a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Hendon, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek to raise this point of order now because it might be difficult for you to give the point of order the consideration that you might wish to give it, Mr. Crowther, if I were to raise it at the last moment when we discuss the second group of amendments on clause 2. I am not seeking a ruling at the moment, but rather a consideration of my arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although you have selected new clauses 2, 3 and 6, you have not thought it desirable to select new clause 4 despite the fact that they all form a package. One relates to pre-recorded cassettes, and another relates to a levy on television viewing of cinema films; but you have not selected the one about blank cassettes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it is a generally accepted practice that an amendment which would raise a charge on an industry that it not a part of the industry covered by the Bill would be out of order, and that the Chair would not select it. It seems that that has guided you, Mr. Crowther, in your decision not to choose new clause 4. Yet blank video cassettes are an integral part of the film industry. They are produced and sold in far greater numbers for a running time equal to, or in excess of the normal running time of a film.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had it been the intention of those who sold blank cassettes to make them for video cameras, for amateur or other purposes, or solely for taping film programmes that were for subsequent viewing but made solely for (television programme purposes, it is unlikely that anyone would think it necessary to produce a tape of that length. Most cinema feature films shown on television run for well in excess of an hour and, I would guess probably for an hour and a half.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is plenty of evidence that not only do those who make these blank tapes provide them for buyers who will use them to record feature films, but the majority of people probably use them for this purpose. That means that the majority of sales are intimately related to the existence of cinema feature films on television. It is not unfair to say that were it possible for you to consider new clause 4 in that light, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary—who is moving round the room— might feel able to accept the amendment, although of course he cannot accept an amendment that the Chair has found wanting in this respect. He is such a reasonable man that I am sure he will see the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
force of my arguments. Indeed, he may well be able to supplement some of them. I hope, therefore, Mr. Crowther, that it will be possible in the intervening time for you to reconsider this the new clause. Whether it is taken with this group or with another group is, of course, entirely a matter for you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crowther. I have much sympathy with the argument of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), but when you reply, Mr. Crowther, will you confirm that in selecting for debate new clause 2, which includes a reference —at least in principle—to the possibility of a levy on blank tapes, as well as to other forms of levy, it would be in order to discuss this matter as a possible solution for the Government to the problem that we hope to pose to them in terms of replacing the levy that they are about to do away with?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what has been said. As has been surmised, I do not intend to give a ruling immediately, but I shall take these matters fully into account. I shall take the benefit of advice from the learned Clerk and give a ruling later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek in any way to argue with your comments at this stage, Mr. Crowther, but perhaps you could tell us whether, when you give your ruling on the important issue raised by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), you are prepared to listen to reasoned argument on any ruling that the Chair might give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is something that I shall also take into account. I shall not make a decision on that matter either at this stage. We shall now proceed with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REPEAL OF FILMS ACTS 1960 TO 1980 AND ABOLITION OF CINEMATOGRAPH FILMS COUNCIL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [29 November],</i> No. 2, in page 1, line 6, to leave out subsection (2) and insert the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>" (2) In accordance with section (British Film Authority), there shall be, in place of the Cinematograph Films Council, a British Film Authority.".—[	<i>Mr. Gould.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing new clause 5—	<i>British Film Authority</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>"(1) The Secretary of State shall by order made by statutory instrument establish within one year from the date of the passing of this Act a British Film Authority (referred to in this section as ' the Authority').
	<ol>
	<li>The Authority shall have vested in it, and shall report annually to the Secretary of State on its performance of, the following functions:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the relevant film functions of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Education

	<li>the administration of any arrangements provided by this or any other Act for the promotion of British films and of British cinemas.</li>
	<li>the monitoring of the distribution and exhibition of films in cinemas, and of the progress made towards implementation of the recommendations of the 1983 Monopolies and Mergers Commission Report on Cinema Distribution and Exhibition.</li></ol>
	<li>No order made under this section shall be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.</li>
	<li>The Secretary of State may give financial assistance to the Authority; and any sums so spent shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament.".</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I moved amendment No. 2 at our last sitting and drew attention to new clause 5, I hope that I managed to disabuse hon. Members of the idea that Opposition Members thought there was some particular magic in the title that we propose to give to the new body. I repeat that, if it is proposed to call it something else, we are perfectly content with whatever label might be preferred, provided that the functions are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the central point of this debate. Some objection was taken to the notion of what was described as yet another quango. That was said, I think, by the Minister and perhaps also by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton). In principle, the establishment of a British film authority, in unifying the administration, regulation, supervision, monitoring and advice-giving functions that at present are scattered throughout Whitehall and in various quangos, should reduce the number of bodies that have responsibilities in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central issue is whether the Government are prepared to have those functions carried out at all, and whether they want the film industry to be properly administered, properly supervised, properly provided with resources and properly provided with the drive, commitment and recognition of its cultural value that it needs. If the answer is no, no further discussion arises on the form of institution that might fulfil those functions. But if, as I hope— I am sure that this hope is shared by all members of the Committee—the Minister's answer to those questions is, " Yes, we see the need to make sure that the British film industry survives ", it becomes a very real issue. How should we do it? What mechanism should we provide? Are we satisfied with the current position, which I imagine most people consider profoundly unsatisfactory?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the question is about functions, not labels that might be attached to any new body. It will not, in principle, do anything that is not already being done although it may be being done less effectively at present. The simple question is, if those things are to be done, how are they to be done efficiently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
We need to know what the Government have in mind. They could say that they do not hold out much hope for the future of the film industry and, in all prudence, wish to withdraw and wash their hands of it and see how it gets on when left to the mercy of market forces. They might put in a little public money, but not very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt we will discuss the money available to the industry on a later amendment, but it is worth pointing out that £1.5 million per annum is just one seventh of what the Eady levy was originally worth. That is a measure of how much the Government are prepared to put into the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government say that they intend to withdraw and have no real interest in providing any mechanism for any overall public involvement in the industry? Will they then go further and say that they will hand over such money as they are prepared to provide, and also the assets of the existing major public institution—the NFFC—to a commercial company which will have no obligation other than to serve its own commercial interests? That company can walk off with the money and at the end of three years say, " That was a very nice thank you, but our commercial interests suggest to us that there is no future in the film industry".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all those things happen, the Government are correct to say that they want nothing to do with any British film authority or similar body. There will be no need to provide any such mechanism. Indeed, if that were to happen I believe that the Minister or his successor would come back at the end of the three or five-year period, no doubt with another piece of legislation, and say, " It is very sad but the British film industry has disappeared. There is no further point in putting money into it as it is a lame duck. There is no point in throwing good money after bad—it has all gone by the board." If that is the Government's position they should say so clearly to the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is not just about the resources and in-stituional structures needed to administer the industry. A question also arises about the structure of the industry. That is another matter raised sensibly by the new clause. I assume that we are all familiar with the damning report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the structure of the British film industry. From that report a picture of an industry emerged that marketed films, as a report of the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians said, on the basis of self-fulfilling prophecies. Therefore, the structure of the industry led the distributors and exhibitors to go always for the safe film. The safe film will almost always be non-British and almost always an American film. Quite apart from the resources which are, or are not, made available to the British film industry, the whole structure of the industry militates against the survival of an indiginous industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two thirds of the market is controlled by two major distributors and two major distributors dominate the exhibition of films in this country. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
whole cosy relationship is tied up through alignments of various sorts and then bolstered by restrictive practises. We see the malign consequences of that duopoly in the sad story of cinema attendances. It is a universal phenomenon that cinema attendances have fallen over the past two decades. But our experience has been particularly bad and one reason for that is that as the demand for a product falls, if the suppliers enjoy anything approaching a monopoly, their natural reaction is to put up prices, which further chokes off demand. That has happened in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to my hon. Friend. Does he agree with me that when the Bill reaches the statute book, whatever form the Bill may ultimately take, the time will have come for an independent examination of the cinema industry and the production, capitalisation and financing of new films with a British content?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always tempted to agree with anything that my hon. Friend says. However, we are not short of inquiries, analyses and reports on the film industry. We have had the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have done nothing about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, my hon. Friend is right to say that that report has been ignored. The White Paper itself was the result of an 18-month review of the film industry—a disappointing result, no doubt, that the review was apparently carried out. The Government's response to the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has been totally ineffective. The one minor measure suggested to try out on the industry a small part of the report's recommendations was totally rejected by the industry. There was no co-operation at all. We therefore need to know—I hope that the Minister will make it clear in the debate—what the Government now propose to do. Unless they propose to take action to break down the duopoly in the industry, we can kiss the future of the British film industry goodbye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for die Government, the Minister and other members of the Committee to shudder and say that the British film authority does not sound very good, to reject it, and yet to make no suggestion as to how functions essential to the future of the British film industry will be carried out. The Minister and other members of the Committee should tell us whether they agree that those functions are crucial to the survival of the industry, and if so, what mechanism they intend to provide to ensure that they continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned two major areas in which the British film authority is of crucial importance. I believe that some of my hon. Friends would wish to suggest other vital functions for such a body to carry out—for example, the statistical function, or monitoring the development of the industry. There is also the question of the future of the national film development fund, which is at present
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
left in limbo to be exploited by son of NFFC. I understand that that is the Government's proposal, although it is not mentioned in the Bill. That fund is universally regarded as a crucial nursery bed for the industry, yet it will have no element of public control. The company will take £500,000 of Government money and operate as a private commercial company which may at the end of two years wash its hands of the whole business. We need a public institution to monitor, supervise and regulate the real governmental effort that we hope will be made in the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke of Government money. My understanding is that the Government are putting into the new NFFC company money that has not come from taxpayers but has accrued from the Eady levy. That money came from cinema seats being paid for, and has nothing to do with public taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has identified two separate sources of money, both of which, I believe, are to be made available to the NFFC. The Minister will confirm that there is an element of public taxpayers' money. I believe that £1.5 million will go directly to the successor company and £500,000 per year to the national film development fund. In addition, it is right to say that it is proposed to hand over to the successor company the ownership rights and income-producing capacity of property currently held by the NFFC. But no doubt we shall canvass such matters when we debate amendments to' clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, none of that will work, nor does it bespeak a real Government commitment or belief in the industry's future unless a body exists to ensure that drive and commitment are maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise as matters now stand—as outlined in the Bill—at the end of three or five years the Minister will return to the House to say, in effect, " It is a very sad business but the British film industry can no longer be revived. To all intents and purposes, it is now dead." The Opposition are desperate to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attention has been drawn to the proposal in the White Paper—it does not appear in the Bill, for understandable reasons—that the interim Action Committee should be beefed up to provide an advisory function for the industry. We do not oppose that; it is an important major aspect of any such body. Therefore, in proposing a British film authority—although we are not wedded to the title or the precise mechanism—we are interested to hear further about what the Minister has in mind. One major problem is that the body which the Minister appears to contemplate would have no statutory standing; it would be a purely voluntary, advisory body, with no statutory powers, duties or functions. That diminishes it considerably in our eyes and, no doubt, in the industry's eyes. Rather than rejecting out of hand the notion of a central point upon which the industry can focus its attention, I invite the Minister to tell us more about the powers and functions which he foresees that body fulfilling. We would rather have something than nothing. If the advisory body could be given a substantial role,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
that was commensurate with requirements, we would be interested in supporting that proposal. However, the Minister has told us nothing. Moreover, as it would not be a statutory body, it does not appear in the Bill. So far, he has told us nothing which leads us to believe that such a body will be anything more than a talking shop, which most people would quickly learn to ignore. We need to know more about the Minister's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said will show Members on both sides of the Committee that we are not speaking of a great bureaucracy or centralised institution, with jackboots marching through the industry, telling people what they can and cannot do. We want an institution that will help the industry, and will ensure that there is a practical manifestation of the commitment of the Government and everyone in the industry to its survival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no accident that virtually every major body in the industry supports the broad outlines of the proposition. I have mentioned the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians— the major trade union in the industry—the Interim Action Committee which brought forward a detailed proposal for precisely that kind of body. Moreover, most of the producers' organisations also favour such a body. For example, the Association of Independent Producers drafted its own proposals for such an authority in a somewhat more detailed form than appears in new clause 5. Perhaps the Minister will say that he will look favourably at such a proposal. If so, there will be no shortage of ideas which could be discussed, modified if necessary, and implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Independent Programme Producers Association supports the idea. During the previous sitting I mentioned that the British Film Institute—although not necessarily thinking of a British film authority— emphasised the importance of a body to give significance to the industry's cultural dimension. The industry as a whole recognises the need for a central body which would provide a focus for the industry's needs and requirements. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will not simply reject the idea out of hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Pendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Stalybridge and Hyde) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we want to make progress, so I intend to be brief. A powerful case was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), but I hope that he will not get carried away. I think he got a little carried away when he said that the Minister could well come back in three to five years' time. I have news for him. He will be there in three or five years' time, and I do not believe that he will be saying then that the film industry is dying or dead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for a British film authority have been made, and whether it is called an authority or something else, it is widely accepted that a body is needed at the centre. The helpful interventions of the hon. Members for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) show, as I said on Second Reading, that there is a genuine feeling— both on the Floor of the House and here in Committee—that we want to do something for the film industry. I hope that we shall not get boxed into
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
doctrinaire postures. I am sure that that will not happen, and my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham has set the scene in that respect. Flexibility should be the name of the game. We do not intend to give the Government a bloody nose, and I am sure that no one intends to do that. I hope that we shall continue in that spirit. It is early days, and it certainly has not yet come from the Minister, but we hope that he, too, will take this flexible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave the central issue, which has been well and truly aired, and return to an aspect that was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham, involving the links between production, distribution and exhibition. It has been rightly said that one can have all the Puttnams, Forsyths, Lloyds and all the films that one likes, but unless the distribution and exhibition are right, alongside the production, there will be no film industry, even if my hon. Friend were the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we come back to the issue that we raised on new clause 5, in connection with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, that 18 months seems to be the thing. Everyone looks at the industry for 18 months and then sits on the information. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission had 18 months in which to report to the Office of Fair Trading, and Ministers have sat on that report for the past 18 months. I hope, either in this debate or later, that we shall have a response from the Government Front Bench as to certain aspects of that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accept that the duopoly is working against the interests of the industry. Thorn EMI and Rank, which currently seem much favoured by the Government, are certainly not helping the film industry in many respects. I accept, of course, that they have done their bit, but they are not helping in the distribution and exhibition of films. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham rightly said, there has been a steep decline in the number of people going to cinemas. In spite of this renaissance period, this buoyant period, of which Ministers glibly speak, the punter is not going to the cinema.

I remind the Committee of chapter 6 of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, under the heading of "Distributors", which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Independent Film Distributors' Association said that the practices of the main cinema circuits and of the major distributors who gave them preferential treatment made it virtually impossible for independent commercial cinemas to survive. The independent cinema owner had to face constant refusals when seeking to book the more desirable films for first run in a given area. He could only get them after their audience life had been virtually exhausted by the circuit cinema or if the latter rejected the film, believing it to have little or no potential. The result was that independent cinemas had almost ceased to exist in the cities. If the major circuits decided to close many of their cinemas, a public amenity would be lost. The major distributors themselves would suffer as a result of this short-sighted policy of allowing the independent exhibitors to disappear, as then there would be no cinemas left in large areas of the country other than those supported by the British Film Institute and local authorities."</p></blockquote>
No one can really disagree with that.

On Second Reading I talked about the north-west. It is an area that I know better than other areas—speaking as a man of Kent. I referred to the Boltons, Blackburns, Oldhams and Burys—the suburbs of Greater Manchester where there is only one cinema or none at all. That is not because of the thrust of competition. The opposite is true. In many of those areas Rank or EMI have removed their cinemas and an independent cinema or a municipal authority has tried to fill the gap. However, they are not getting the films that they want to show to the people in those areas. It is regrettable that those two giants are strangling many of the bodies who wish to take part in this renaissance and to pick up films on the circuits to show them to the punters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I tabled a question to one of the Minister's colleagues about the experiment suggested by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal was for an experiment in Glasgow and Manchester for a short period—six months—in order to give the independents and municipals, as well as the big two, the opportunity to show films of their choice in their cinemas. Again, the Government sat on it for 18 months. Ministers have said that they are looking at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After I received that negative answer last week, I rang up the director of the Office of Fair Trading, who will write to me. It will take him a week, but I am not blaming him for that—certainly it will not take 18 months. He will tell me exactly what the snag is. I understand that it is Rank, as EMI is prepared to go along with the experiment. I should like the Minister to consider this and gee up his colleague to make a decision. Neither the Committee nor the cinema generally wants to be fobbed off more than it has been already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall undoubtedly raise this matter again until we receive satisfaction. There are two independent cinemas in my constituency, in two separate towns, which are desperate to get those films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us in an aside in our previous sitting that he was going off to lunch with Lady Falkender. I can proudly tell the Committee that I and some of my colleagues had dinner with David Puttnam last night. If it is not straying out of order too much, perhaps Ministers can tell us their experiences over lunch, dinner or drinks. David Puttnam, who seems to be the golden boy of the British Government when they wish to join in all the glory that comes from " Chariots of Fire", made an important point last night when he said that the future of British cinema would not be in the cities but in the suburbs. It will develop there, but only if there is something from which the seed can grow—the independents and municipals which are being starved at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that unless the municipals and rural cinemas, whether in the hands of private individuals or local authorities, can get almost a first option on major feature films to break the monopoly, no semi-rural
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
or urban audience can be developed. Those people will go only to see well-known films.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pendry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will not become tedious and repetitious if I agree with my hon. Friend. I take his point as it is part of what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important and a good move for the Government to show their goodwill. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission looked into the matter closely. We were not asking a great deal in suggesting an experiment of a short period of time to see how the market developed. The position could then be assessed at the end of that period. A positive move should be made this morning by the Minister. He should get up and tell us that that is now very much on the cards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to urge my hon. Friend the Minister to accept the amendment. I also want to urge my hon. Friends to support it. But I hope that my hon. Friends will support it not because the contents as laid out are line by line exactly right, but because the concept of a statutory authority for the films industry seems to be right, granted the position in which the cinema film industry finds itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall argue, under a different set of amendments, that certain functions are required to be done in circumstances where a free market does not operate and, because of that lack, certain things flow from it. However, I shall not anticipate that argument. The concept, with all its imperfections and perhaps with some of its omissions, ought to be written into the Bill at this stage. Not because it is right but, having been put into the Bill, it will wonderfully concentrate the Government's mind to get it right between now and the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a precedent for that, as those hon. Members who served on the Committee during the Cable and Broadcasting Bill will recall. We persuaded the Government not to divide the Committee when it was in agreement that a certain job required to be done. There were faults in the drafting, which we were happy to accept existed, but we put the amendment into the Bill to enable the Government to come forward with their own correct drafting at the Report stage, and that is exactly what the Government did. If we are now to talk about the concept but not to write it into the Bill, I fear that the Government will go away with the impression that they have successfully persuaded Conservative Members that a voluntary, as opposed to a statutory body, is all that is required. That is what the Government have described. But for reasons which I shall certainly adduce at greater length during a subsequent series of amendments, I believe that a voluntary council, authority or whatever, will be totally inadequate. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friends who will not, of course, have the advantage of hearing my arguments at a subsequent lecture will nevertheless see that a case has been made out for something to be written into the Bill at this stage. If nothing adequate comes along to replace it from the Government at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
Report stage, we can drop it if the wording is inadequate. I hope that my hon. Friends will go along with the concept at this stage. Indeed, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will also see the logic in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret not having been able to attend last week's debate, but I have read it. Some of it was fascinating, especially the ministerial luncheon appointment, about which I am sure that we shall hear a great deal more. That debate and the Second Reading debate suggest that there is an overwhelming case for a national film body, as suggested by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and my hon. Friends the Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's previous comments lead me to expect that he will oppose that proposal, and therefore the new clause. I suggest with humility that perhaps his recent experience should lead him to a different conclusion. I shall return to the arguments about co-ordination, which are central to our support for new clause 5. However, the Minister's admission in the Chamber reveals how unwise it would be to impose all those obligations and demands on him, especially as the poor man is already coping with virtually every other section of British industry. He has had only six weeks to prepare for the vital debates on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense that the film industry is one of the few industries without support such as a national body would be free to give. The Minister is left with the support only of his civil servents—albeit admirable support—in trying to rationalise the problems of the industry and set priorities. He is a well-meaning man; no doubt he will wish to set priorities. Nevertheless his position invites confusion such as the Government support so far suggests is writ large in the thinking behind the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to accept that we are dealing with an industry. I would put more emphasis on film culture, but I accept their approach to film as an industry. Why, then, should it be treated so differently from transport, shipbuilding, engineering and the rest, where there are national bodies to advise the Government and the industries, ascertaining views and monitoring progress and legislation. Those industries have the benefit of all that, the most important aspect of which is co-ordination. Why should those benefits not be given to the film industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week the Minister said that he had discovered that the film industry was littered with quangos. I would concede that point, if we adopt an extremely loose definition of the word " quango ". However, the problem is that so many different organisations are working in so many different directions. There should be statutory encouragement to bring the " quangos "together. The hon. Member for Hendon, North argued that case most eloquently. We would then have co-ordination, communication and some sort of collective view in the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Like my hon. Friends I am not taken with the suggested title of the British film authority, but I support the idea behind it. The absence of such an organisation has meant that Parliament has not been as well informed as it would like to have been about film matters, and therefore that the film industry has been disappointed by Parliament's reaction to its problems. Surely it would be much better to have a national organisation advising Parliament and the Government. The House of Commons would then have a clear view of the approach of the film industry in the widest possible sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all been in touch with friends and colleagues who have been involved in practically every stage of film making, production and presentation. For me, and no doubt for others, that has been a useful exercise. However, why can we not formalise the process? I cannot see what would be lost in formalising the input of information to us as parliamentarians. Our discussions, and perhaps in time our legislation, would be all the better for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During or discussions I am sure that hon. Members will have their own views and we shall not always agree about our approach to the industry. However, even if we cannot persuade the Minister, the fact remains that he is accepting for himself and his successors in office a burden that he need not accept, in the absence of a national organisation. Later, when Parliament and the film industry find themselves more definitely on the same wave-length, the idea will develop and be endorsed. It represents the kind of common sense that those involved in transport argue should be applied in the co-ordination of the transport industry. Common sense may not win today, or any day during our discussions of the Bill, but I humbly predict that one day such a body will be formed with statutory backing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dissent from only one aspect of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke). I do not share his sympathy for the Minister's role in supervising so many different industries and his difficulties in getting to grips with the film industry. In our Sunday newspapers at the weekend we read in a justifiably flattering portrait of the Minister of State that he enjoys his work on the film industry. I am sure that we would all echo that sentiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) made a significant contribution. I endorse his remark that we are not wedded to the exact line-by-line wording of new clause 5. The idea and the principle are important, and I wish to discuss them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's speech at the end of our proceedings on Thursday was a disappointing response to the debate. I wish to press him a little further about the details. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" there is a need for an advisory body."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 29 November 1984; c. 38.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
I can understand why the Minister initially dislikes the idea of a statutory authority. The thrust of the White Paper, the Bill and the Government's argument about the film industry is that the removal of control will enable the film industry to flourish and prosper. The Minister also said that the way to defeat monopoly was to encourage competition. That is precisely what we seek to achieve in suggesting a British film authority or a similar body with an overview of the industry, especially of exhibition and distribution. As the Bill stands the Government propose to hand over the only possible overall role within the industry to the two companies that already massively dominate the process of exhibition and distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two major questions about the advisory body of which the Minister spoke during our first sitting. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It ought to embrace"—</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that means embrace in the composition of the body itself or embrace within its overall remit—
	<br><blockquote><p>"exhibitors, television and video."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 29 November 1984; c. 38.]</p></blockquote>
First, will the Minister clarify exactly what he means by that? Does he intend an indication of the contents of the committee membership itself? Secondly, and more importantly, what would the advisory body do? Would it include within its remit a monitoring role on the exhibition and distribution of films as well as the other aspects of the industry? That is crucial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the Minister's and the Government's view. I believe that the Minister has also misunderstood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are already statutorily involved in the film industry because they raise a levy on ITV which—to define it in monetary terms—represents the profits that arise from showing cinema films. The Government are also involved because they raise and establish the BBC licence fee. That, of course, goes to pay the pittance which the BBC pays for cinema films.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I had not misunderstood. However, as he correctly pointed out, I had failed to say that the Government are closely involved, in a statutory role, with the exhibition of films on television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge Committee members to consider whether— with the Government participating through a British Film Authority, with other interests represented on it —there should be a statutory monitoring process over the exhibition and distribution of films through the cinemas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point is crucial to subsection (2)(d) of new clause 5. Let us consider what is happening in America and Britain. It is perhaps surprising that in the United States—where the availability of film on television is far greater than in Britain, and is growing—cinema attendances are going up. If cinema attendances are going up in America, why are they continuing to decline at an alarming rate in Britain? The traditional answer is that television is more
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
widely available and that the boom in the video market has taken away the desire and opportunity to go to the cinema. As well as those factors, perhaps another is the pricing and distribution policies of those organisations in charge of the cinemas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider cinema attendances and admission prices. One of the clearest differences between the United States and Britain is that admission prices to cinemas in America have, in real terms, been falling in recent years whereas in Britain they have been going up. To take a selected bunch of years; in 1955 admissions to cinemas in Britain were 1,182 million; in 1970 they fell to 193 million, and in 1981 they fell to 84 million. At the same time admission prices, using 1955 as a base of 100, went up in 1970 to 342 and in 1981 to 1,815. If we compare what happened to the retail price index, at a base of 100 in 1955, we see that in 1970 the figure was 169 and in 1981 it was 694. Therefore, cinema admission prices have increased by three times the rate of the retail price index. That is a staggering increase over and above the general drift of prices. Surely, that is not an immaterial fact when we look at the way in which cinema attendances have fallen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at other aspects of the way in which films are shown and distributed, we see that there is a barring system on showing films within some areas or outside particular distribution chains. The take for some distribution companies rises with the more popular films and falls with the less popular films, and the whole structure of the way in which exhibition and distribution takes place needs careful monitoring and scrutiny. Indeed, the recommendations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report point us strongly in that direction because the report raises a number of important questions about the way in which films are distributed and exhibited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate he will be more exact than he has been and tell us more about what he has in mind with regard to the advisory body. I also hope that he will give us an assurance that the body he has in mind will not just look at the production of new films and the encouragement of new talent, but will also look at an extremely important end of the market, namely, the process of distribution and exhibition which is dominated by two major companies. Those major companies will, of course, have a strong role if the Government have their way about the future NFFC. Even if the Minister will not accept the arguments we have made, and those of the hon. Member for Hendon, North, for a statutory body to have a monitoring, supervising and encouraging role in the film industry—I strongly support that principle while not being wedded to every exact detail—I hope that he will go some way towards us. Perhaps he will clarify for us, rather more seriously than he did on Thursday, what exactly he has in mind in terms of an advisory rather than a statutory body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Norman Lament)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spelt out last time, albeit briefly, why we do not believe that a statutory advisory body such as is proposed in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
amendment is necessary or desirable. I said, too, that the terms of reference for the body in the amendment mix up regulatory, advisory, and executive functions, including some functions that in fact disappear with this legislation. Therefore, the amendment is not acceptable. Despite the blandishments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), I do not believe in general that advisory bodies of this nature are necessary, even in the somewhat exceptional circumstances of the film industry. We have said—it was spelt out in the White Paper—that we believe there is a need for an advisory body, but we would infinitely prefer is to be a voluntary body. Moreover, we would prefer it to emerge from the industry itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury (Mr. Smith), in a most interesting speech, asked me to be a little more precise. However, I am in some difficulty in that respect, because we are consulting on the matter. I said at our last sitting that we were open to receive representations about the composition of the committee. Some people have taken advantage of what I said and have written to me preferring their advice. I shall be happy to receive more such letters, telling me what people think is the best amalgamation of interests within the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said before, and as was said in the White Paper, we see the Interim Action Committee as the nucleus. It should be a broadly-based committee. In our view, it should include exhibitors, including the television industry. I have in mind the membership when I say that, if I may answer the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury directly. However, I emphasise that we are still consulting on the matter, and we want to hear the views of the industry and the Interim Action Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The body would have a general advisory function. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked whether it would be able to monitor competition, trends in distribution, and so on. In fact, it would not have a monitoring function, but it would be able to comment on those extremely important matters. We envisage a body with the widest possible terms of reference, generally advising the Government on the problems and trends in the industry. However, as I said, we are open to suggestions about the composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Islington, South and Fins-bury and for Staylbridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry) raised the important issue of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. I agree that it has taken a long time. I cannot add much to what was said by my hon. Friend in his answer. My hon. Friend the Minister for Consumer Affairs is considering the recommendations about the distribution of films and an experimental scheme to test the effects of the change recommended by the Director General of Fair Trading. As has been said repeatedly in the debate, the cinema industry is in a delicate state, and we must be sure that the changes will be beneficial and that they will be discussed with the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
I give the Committee an undertaking that we shall make a statement—not necessarily an oral statement, but a response—so that the Committee can have an answer before Report, because what both hon. Members said about the importance of the issue is right. I hope that that will be of some help, because the issue is central to the industry. However, for all the reasons that I gave at our last sitting, I am afraid that I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment, as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the Minister said. I understand that he has difficulty in accepting the amendment in its present form—it is a familiar dilemma for Committees. However, I think that my right hon. and hon. Friends and others who sympathise with the broad thrust of what we are trying to achieve will have listened carefully to the substance of what the Minister told us. It is that substance which is disappointing to us. We cannot see how the new advisory body will be different from the existing organisations—for example the Cinematograph Films Council and the Interim Action Committee. Their proliferation shows how unsatisfactory their role can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also not clear to us how the advisory body will grapple with what the Minister himself concedes to be the delicate state of the industry. That is an advance—we have got that far. But an advisory body simply cannot do that job. For that reason in the hope that we can impress on the Minister the importance of establishing one that can do that job, we wish to press the amendment to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move an amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 9, leave out subsection (3). This is essentially a probing amendment. It is a somewhat mysterious provision which appears to provide some sort of indemnity to the Cinematograph Films Council for misdemeanours which are not clear to the Committee. We have moved the amendment because we should like to find out what is behind subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must assume that at some point the Cinematograph Films Council exceeded its powers, that it was improperly constituted, did not follow the statutory provisions, or acted in some way beyond its powers. If that was a matter of substance, we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
should know what it was. However, it is not clear how it could be a matter of substance as the Cinematograph Films Council has powers under the Films Act 1960 to keep matters under review, revise and make reports. It is hard to see how any of those functions could result in a change in the legal position of anyone inside or outside the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since an indemnity is presumably only necessary to protect the council or council members against the possibility of legal action, it is not clear how it could have acted in a way that would require an indemnity in the first place. I hope that we shall have a brief explanation from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that this is a probing amendment. I hope to allay his fears by explaining to him that during 1983 six out of seven reappointments of the independent members of the Cinematograph Films Council were not made by the then Minister, Mr. Ian Sproat. It is possible that consequences of some of the advice they gave could be subject to challenge in the courts. In particular, it could be claimed by an individual producer that grants made to the National Film and Television school and the British Film Institute Production Board were not valid, and that money paid out in those grants should have gone instead in payments to producers. Only a case in the courts could determine that, but if this were held to be so, and the grants regarded as invalid, it would be necessary to seek to recover them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection is essentially for the protection of the NFTS and the BFI. The amendment would therefore render them liable to a risk in this area and I do not believe that it is the intention of those putting down the amendment to place at risk either of those bodies. For obvious reasons, therefore, the Government cannot accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's fears are allayed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. It is very much as we suspected. However, would he tell us a little more about the nature of what I assume was a mistake, when he told the Committee that six out of seven independent members were not appointed by the appropriate Minister? Can he tell us by whom they were appointed and how the mistake arose? I take the point that the Minister made about distribution of funds being possibly the subject of litigation, but the Cinematograph Film Council presumably had a purely advisory role in deciding how those funds should be distributed. It is a little difficult to see how any impropriety in the council's constitution could affect the validity of those grants. Perhaps the Minister will say a little about that as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will assist the hon. Gentleman further. He made the point in his earlier intervention that possibly the body had exceeded its powers. That is not true and therefore we can dispense with the point. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it may have been improperly constituted and I believe that he and the Committee deserve an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
When positions were being considered in the latter part of 1982 for the reappointments falling due on 1 January 1983, Mr. Sproat decided that in view of the expected imminence of the announcement of the abolition of the CFC he would only appoint those he felt obliged to. In so doing, he appointed one independent member, the chairman—Dame Elizabeth Ackroyd—instead of seven. Other appointments were made for one year rather than the more normal three-year period. Mr. Sproat took his action as he felt that his announcement of the film policy review would be made within the next month. In the event, it was some 18 months before the White Paper was published. It was delayed by, among other things, the 1983 general election, Mr. Sproat's disappearance —for reasons with which we are all familiar and the fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) wished to traverse the same ground before making up his mind. That is the explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister invests the whole saga with a wonderful air of mystery. The concept of Mr. Sproat disappearing is a charming one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must conclude that the Government are, in a sense, caught by one of the somewhat messy consequences of their own dilatoriness in producing the results of their review. We simply want to record that point rather than to exploit it in any way. We fully understand from the Minister's explanation why the subsection is necessary and are grateful for that explanation.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to give recognition to what the Government have already mentioned in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
Bill, that the removal of the Eady levy should be considered earlier than the stated 12-month final period. I readily accept from what the Minister said on Second Reading that the Secretary of State by order may end the levy a good deal earlier than 12 October 1985. This series of amendments merely gives rise to that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister tell us what is in the Government's mind with regard to the Eady levy and its eventual abolition? On Second Reading we were virtually all united—Opposition Members and many Conservative Members—by the fact that the Eady levy should go. I shall not make a long speech in favour of that as the general principle has already been accepted. But I believe that the fact that the levy exists is wrong and outdated and its continued existence will cause just a few more months of damage to an industry which, as we heard so graphically this morning, is hardly healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974 the number of cinemas was 1,590 and at the beginning of 1984 we were down to 1,303. Indeed, as has already been said, the total number of admissions in 1974 was 143 million; the figures is now down to 64 million. The takings for the Eady levy since the earliest days—effectively during the voluntary code in 1950—were £1·2 million; in 1951–52, £3 million was levied. Now, in 1982–83, we are down to £4·8 million and that is in money with no adjustment in real terms. Although there was a peak in 1978–79 of £7.5 million, largely financed by American-made films made in Britain, we are now in a position where the levy is not only hardly worth collecting but is acting in the disinterests of the cinema industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I mentioned that the attitude of people towards the cinema has changed over the years, particularly about the quality of the cinema. Anyone who has been to the cinema in recent years knows that, apart from a few instance, they are comfortable, air conditioned, and more attractive in areas such as food and other services. Further encouragement should be given to the industry, and removing the Eady levy as soon as possible can only held in that respect, provided that, once it no longer benefits the distributors, it is not immediately shifted on to the rental of films. That would be just as bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the modern cinema is attractive, and while the films shown there cannot be enjoyed in the same way anywhere else, we must remember that a generation of people is getting used to renting video films in shops. There are now millions of people who have not seen a feature film in the way that it should be seen. My hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Atkins) said that he had not been to the cinema for seven years. I regard that as a great tragedy, although it might be welcomed by many people who go to the cinema. My hon. Friend should go to the cinema, and not just feel the comfort of the cinema but listen to the sound and experience the modern cinema. There is no similarity at all, apart from a visually moving image, between the cinema and the same film being shown on video at home. I do not decry or run down video which, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
I said on Second Reading, I regard as one of the great inventions of my lifetime, but it is a different experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned "Chariots of Fire" on Second Reading. I saw that film at home over a curry dinner. I had to wash up half-way through it—that is the nature of our family arrangement—and I admit that there was little that dragged me back to the screen. I did not feel the passion, the hope rising in my heart, or the nation's will. That is true of many other films, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith (Wealdon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw " Chariots of Fire " on television, and I was thrilled. Perhaps I was thrilled by it because I did not have to disappear half-way through to wash up, which is a most dispiriting and discouraging experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had my hon. Friend seen the film at the cinema, he would have been positively ecstatic. One reason why I go to the cinema is that I do not have to wash up half-way through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I put it to my hon. Friend that when he saw it on television he was seeing only part of the film, because it was intended for a wide screen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, as he is on many matters relating to this legislation. It is difficult to get the scope of a cinema film on to a television screen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be honest, I believe that television is a second best. I should hate to think that films were made solely for television, and not for the cinema. We must remember that at present films are being made for the cinema and then shown on television, to raise revenue for it. Indeed, where would the television industry be without the feature film that is made for the cinema? It is well known that the purchase of feature films helps to finance the BBC and ITV companies. The feature films that are purchased—in spite of the vast sums that are regularly paid at Christmas time for feature films made for cinema and shown on television—are still much cheaper, on a cost basis, than producing drama or almost any other television programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital, therefore, that we bring back many more people to cinemas, to see the film as it was meant to be seen. It is no substitute to see a great work of art by looking at a photograph in a daily newspaper. One has to go to the gallery to see the work as it was meant to be enjoyed. The same is true of films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in cinema prices has exceeded the rate of inflation, it is because one has to pay for the staff to keep a cinema open and to pay the rent and the local authority rates—which, I might add, have been dramatically wicked on inner city cinemas. We must do all we can to reduce those prices, and that is why I suggest that the Eady levy should be removed as soon as possible to stop the increases in the prices of cinema seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cinema companies are trying hard to invest in attractive cinemas, and if the Government gave a positive indication of how and when they intended
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
to remove the Eady levy—there is a subsection in the Bill giving them the power to do so—we should all be much happier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Eady levy was justified when it was introduced. I accept that those were protectionist days, but it was a good idea at the time. Nor has the idea failed us. I merely feel that the practice of the film-viewing public has changed from the cinema to the television screen, and that if the levy was justified then it is justified now on the feature films made for cinema that are shown on television. As the Minister knows, I would prefer to have a similar levy on blank tapes and audio tapes, not only for the purpose of financing but for copyright protection to stop the institutionalised theft of intellectual property. However, that is a wider issue, and I shall not pursue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton), who suggested at our last sitting that I should declare an interest, may I point out that I have not earned any money from the film industry for 38 years, although I am not above asking for a new contract. Five members of my family are members of Equity, and my mother wishes it to be known, as I said that she is looking for work after Christmas, that she is fully employed for the next 12 months, and that she is advertising for Christmas 1985. However, my sister says that invitations have rolled in since our Second Reading debate. Perhaps I should declare an interest, because I am told that my Christmas present is directly in proportion to the amount of work she gets as a result of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the Eady levy must be scrapped, and it will be scrapped. The Government agree that it is to be scrapped. In my view, the Government have made generous provision for the financing of films, quite apart from the levy. The proportion of British films to foreign films is still dramatically out of kilter, but if more people go back to the cinema and enjoy the surroundings in which the films were originally shown, that will result in films being made in greater numbers and of similar quality over the years. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give us some indication of an earlier abolition of the Eady levy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only briefly, merely to ask the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) to elaborate one point. Initially, I was a little puzzled about the purpose of the amendments, but I am now satisfied that they were to enable the hon. Gentleman to make an entertaining speech, most of which I thoroughly endorse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intention was merely to ask the Minister what he intended in clause 2(4), and to ask why powers had been granted for the Eady levy to be scrapped earlier than the 12 months. We have not been told about the time that is intended. My amendment proposed six months instead of 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. In many ways, it is a probing amendment. How-
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
ever, he mentioned a matter that cropped up on Second Reading. When the levy ends, is there any assurance or mechanism whereby the money saved will go towards the refurbishment of cinemas or the attraction of cinema audiences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. I hope that in return for the Eady levy being scrapped, the cinema industry would make such a pledge. The hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot give such an assurance, merely express a hope. However, I believe that the distributors must not increase their rental charges to cover what they would lose. That would be self-defeating, but it is a great and present danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), whose amendment is designed to persuade the Minister to commit himself to an early date for the decision. I listened with great interest to my hon. Friend's amusing and informative speech, and at the time I wondered why he had chosen 13 April. In a recent intervention I discovered that the reason was mat that date was exactly six months in advance. From the point of view of those of us who seek to achieve more for the film industry, my hon. Friend might well have chosen 1 April. However, we can live with 13 April. Incidentally, I wonder whether my hon. Friend's adverse reaction to " Chariots of Fire" on the television might have been caused by the menu that he chose—perhaps curry would have been better with " Gandhi" than with " Chariots of Fire ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, too, to underline an argument advanced by my hon. Friend to demonstrate that the film made for cinema is different, and should be different, from the film made for television. It must be looked after differently, too. A figure sent to me only yesterday by the Independent Television Companies Association supports the strength of my argument. The ITV companies claim to spend on film purchases about £28 million a year. That comes out of an income of roughly £1,000 million this year. I do not have the figures in front of me, but I suspect that about one quarter of ITV's output consists of feature films. One wonders whether the film industry, making films for cinema which are eventually shown on television, is justly treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Minister to accept a definite commitment to an earlier finish of the Eady levy, and again to reconsider the other options which must come forward if we are to protect the cinema industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), apart from the shocking revelation that my PPS had not been to the cinema for seven years. Perhaps he will have to reconsider his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with what my hon. Friend said, and agree with what he said about trends in the plight of cinemas. The sad state of affairs is reflected in my constituency, where our cinema seems fairly likely to close. As my hon. Friend's constituency is next to mine, no doubt many of his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
constituents, as well as mine, use that cinema. As the Committee knows, that is one of the major reasons for our wish to end the Eady levy. It has become the last straw for the cinema sector, contributing further to the great problems that it already has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with my hon. Friends objective, but I cannot commit myself to that precise date. Of course, we intend to end the levy as quickly as possible after the legislation receives the Royal Assent. There are uncertainties, however. One is the speed with which the legislation will go through not only this House but another place, too. There is also the rate of build-up of the levy during the year, which is difficult to forecast. We have certain commitments to use the levy in the final year. We have a commitment to the NFTS and the BFI. We need to have received enough money through the levy to meet those commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to forecast precisely by what month of the year we shall have enough money to meet those commitments and the final pro rata payment that has to be paid to the NFFC. In the levy year 1982–83 we would have raised enough money for the sort of commitments we have now by March. In 1983–84 we would have kept the levy until May. Therefore, there are considerable uncertainties about this matter, and we do not know precisely what is happening till a month later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that currently some £5 million is available in reserves, although the levy is only £3.5 million per annum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have reserves. On Second Reading I said what we intended to do about that. We have to distribute the money raised each year according to the methods specified in the legislation. I assure my hon. Friend that we have to do it and that we shall have to get the money from this year's proceeds in order to meet the commitments that I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I would not be able to accept the precise date, we intend to end the levy as quickly as possible. That might be by the date that my hon. Friend has in mind, or at a later date. He asked how the levy would be ended. It would be done by order under clause 2(4). I hope that, in the light of my commitment that we want to end it as soon as possible, my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's commitment to the earliest possible scrapping of the Eady levy. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have given careful thought to the matters raised at the beginning of the sitting in connection with new clause 4, and have taken certain advice. I have weighed these matters carefully, and decided that it would not be appropriate for me to select new clause 4. I shall not go into the reasons at present. I merely remind hon. Members of their rights. If they wish to table an amendment on Report, Mr. Speaker will make a decision then.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to remind the Committee of the overall purpose of clause 2. It recognises that the Eady levy has outlived its usefulness, as was said earlier, and that it must go. In doing so, it seeks to remove an impediment that affects the viability of cinemas because it does not contribute to the viability of film makers either in any meaningful way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is acknowledged in removing the levy that film making for cinemas has not been taking place in a free market. The Eady levy that existed in the first place was an implicit, tacit recognition that a duopoly or, at least, a non-free market was operating in the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the remaining clauses is that when the Eady levy has been abolished, there will be residual assets within the NFFC to be disposed of and to set a framework for film making in the brave new world of cable, satellite, video cassettes and, dare I say, refurbished cinemas. It is inappropriate that we should proceed to deal with what the brave new world will consist of until we have analysed exactly what the position will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment Nos. 43 and 44 is to seek to establish the nature of the distorted, unfree, regulated market in which cinema film production has, and will have to continue to exist. Having examined the nature of how unfree the market is, we must find remedies which will have proper relevance to the context in which the film industry will operate. That is the purpose of amendment Nos. 39 and 44 and new clauses 2, 3 and 6 which the Opposition have tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All provide a remedy that stems from an acceptance of the arguments that underlie the assertion that cinema film making takes place in an artificially,
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
distorted context. In what way, it may be asked, is the market for cinema films artificial? In what way, is it managed in a way that free markets are not? In a word, it is the existence of duopoly. That of course, is why the Eady levy, the NFFC and so on had to exist. But that is not all. The alternative outlets for supplementing the earnings received from cinemas is a heavily rigged market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, within ITV there is monopoly buying at what I would regard as knock-down prices. I am advised that the average per hour sum paid by either the BBC or ITV stations for a British film would be well under £5,000 perhaps as little as £2,000 for a full-length feature film which was not necessarily a new film. A new film, which had done well at the box office, might well get a sum considerably in excess of that. Equally I am advised that this is unlikely to be more than £100,000 to £300,000. But, if one goes for the average older film, sometimes as little as £2,000 will be paid. That is only a tiny fraction of the per hour cost to television of producing its own drama of a comparable standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commercial television does not get its revenues on a basis that it awards a price to film makers. Commercial television gets its revenue on the basis of how many viewers see its programmes. On the basis of how many people see its programmes it charges the advertiser accordingly. Therefore, it relates its prices to the number of people who view its programmes, ITV revenues are based on the number of people who view its programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BBC exercises monopoly purchasing too. It derives its revenues from licence fees that may accrue not necessarily because of the merits of BBC programmes, but perhaps because of the merits of ITV programmes. BBC revenues are related not to the number of people who view BBC programmes, but to the number who own television sets. BBC revenues are therefore related to the total number of people who watch television programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cinema films, of course, get their revenues initially from the number of people who go to the cinema to watch them. However, what happens when a film appears on television has no relationship with the number of people who view it. We have therefore the extraordinary situation that I mentioned in my Second Reading speech. About 66 million people go to the cinema, but 4 billion people watch films on television. There must be something wrong with the organisation of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a free market one could say, "All right, if people want to watch your cinema films on television, show them." However, there is not a free market, and one cannot set up a television station without the permission of the IBA or the Government. There is a distorted market. One cannot have direct access to television viewers; one must go through the agents of the Government—the IBA companies or the BBC. It is alleged that the television companies make fat profits from that monopoly. In the past a Government took the view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
that those excess profits were a social scandal, and that therefore the Treasury must take a share. There is now an ITV levy on profits, which goes into the Treasury. The profits are not recycled into film production, yet often it is the films shown on television that produce those profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The film industry enables the commercial television companies to make profits, which are syphoned off by the Government and the Treasury. No doubt they are spent on some worthy purpose, but they are not spent on film making. The best solution would be for the television companies to pay a fair price for what enables them to hold audiences and make profits. When clause 2 abolishes the out-of-date ineffective Eady levy, what should be put in its place to adjust the Government-willed distortions is a recycling of the funds earnt for television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 suggest a tribunal. Amendment No. 43 was tabled for technical reasons which no longer apply; the same words appear at the end of Amendment No. 44. The purpose of seeking to set up a tribunal to look at fair prices is to draw attention to the fact that the BBC and ITV pay ridiculous sums of money but return insufficient for film making for the cinema.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) said a few moments ago that a great deal of money is spent by the ITV companies on producing films. However, those films are produced for showing on television, not in the cinema. It is important to remember that those cinema films which are most successful on television have usually cost large sums of money that are, with very few exceptions, out of proportion to the sort of money that is spent on producing television films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only fair to ask what the Independent Television Companies Association says about this matter. All hon. Members received a brief which the ITCA helpfully and courteously provided. However, the arguments do not bear too much examination. The first argument is, " We make films for Channel 4 ". I wonder how that helps to finance films such as " Ghandi " and " Chariots of Fire ". I do not believe that any films that have been successful internationally would have been made but for the fact that they were made for showing first in cinemas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ITCA also says. " We subsidise the National Film School and the British Film Institute, and make grants to the National Film Archive ". However, I remind the television industry that those organisations are also a television school, television institute and television archive. I believe that by setting aside money for investment in what was originally a film institute and so on, the ICTA has saved the cost of doing that for television purposes only. I do not believe that its argument is relevant. We should give due to credit the ITCA, but that does not excuse it from paying less than necessary for cinema films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ITCA says also, "We spend money in the film industry and on equipment, services, and technicians ". That is true. However, that does not finance the making of new films and we are talking of the making of large, popular blockbuster films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
I wish to mention what the BBC said about this matter. I read in a newspaper report recently that the man who buys films for television said, " We pay a fair price for them". That is precisely the sort of argument that sticks in our gullets. What does " fair price " mean, except from the standpoint of what the BBC buyer has in his budget, which is decided by the Director-General and managers of the BBC. That is not the meaning of a fair price. A fair price, if it means anything, is the price related to the value of the product, the money that has gone into it, and the number of people who buy or watch that product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other argument that the BBC is fond of using is, " If you make us pay the levy, the licence fee will have to go up". I leave it to hon. Members to decide how many questions that begs. But is it necessary or fair for the BBC to use the underpayment for films to pay for the other things that it produces. If the corporation is to be asked to pay a sensible amount, is it not in the interests of the viewer that it should spend less money on some of those things, as feature films are clearly much more desirable in his opinion? I am told that than an increase in the licence fee of as little as 30p per licence holder would meet the bill in that respect. In view of that and of the attraction of cinema films, clearly the BBC has a spurious argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that we face in the amendments is who should doctor, rig or artificially construct this unfree market? Should it be the ITV companies, the BBC—or the duopoly between them—or the Government? I pointed out earlier that the Government already intervene by setting the licence fee and the ITV levy. In other words, they are not being asked to do something that is unprecedented. As I see it, the Government must ensure that some of the funds which clearly relate to the showing of the products of an industry are available to that industry; they are not at present, because of the existence of an artificial market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between our industry and that of the United States is remarkably important. Americans can recover their costs on their home market and spread any jam from the profits that they earn overseas. But this country barely covers the costs of producing its films from its home market and squeezes, with any luck, some viability only from overseas sales. Television showings should be brought into the equation of film earnings. Not to do that is unfair and a dereliction of responsibility by a Government who already tinker with the TV industry, in which the cinema film industry is trying to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope and believe that this debate will reveal a great deal of common ground in the Committee. That is why I am happy to endorse virtually everything which the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said. I should make it clear that as part of that common ground I accept, as did most hon. Members on Second Reading, that the Eady levy has come to the end of its natural and practical life and that there is little point in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
continuing with it in its present form. But that leaves open the whole issue, which I am anxious to raise, of what—following the same principles and style of mechanism—might replace it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be pointed out that the Eady levy now raises about one-seventh of what it was originally worth to the film industry; that is the major reason for seeing it as no longer appropriate. As I said earlier, the £1.5 million provided by the levy to the NFFC is now regarded as falling far short of what is required. That puts into proper perspective the sort of sums which the Government propose to provide, at least in some sense, by way of replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demise of the Eady levy for essentially good and practical reasons to do with declining cinema audiences and so on leaves open the major question. Do we say, " Well, that's that. Bad luck about the Eady levy, the cinema industry is clearly on its last legs and there is no prospect of raising any cash there so the poor old film industry must simply go without. We will leave it to a new environment where we put in a little Government money but no more than what is already conceded to be an inadequate sum derived from the Eady levy. We will leave it to market forces even though we know, as the monopolies report showed very clearly, that there is in no sense a free market and that, for all the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave, it is, in effect, a highly rigged market."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we say that we will leave the film industry in circumstances in which we have taken away any effective tax concessions? Do we say that we will leave it in a position whereby the Government's only effective involvement is to pass over such assets as still belong to the NFFC and small sums of Government money to an essentially private company to pursue its own commercial interests for a short period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One simple way of dealing with the matter would be to draw those conclusions from the end of the effective life of the Eady levy. However, a sense animated the hon. Gentleman's speech to the Committee which I hope will appeal to more of his hon. Friends—it certainly commends itself to my hon. Friends. Do we say that something has to be done, that this is far from a free market and that we cannot leave the matter to market forces? There is an urgent need for the industry to find from within its own resources a buoyant, recycling form of revenue to ensure that those who profit pay back at least part of their gain to those who produce. That seems to be an eminently equitable and sensible arrangement. It was, after all, the principle that underlay the Eady levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we ask which course we should follow-to leave the industry to its own devices or to try to find a replacement mechanism for the Eady levy— the overwhelming answer from all aspects of the industry, is that we must find a replacement. It is crucial to have that buoyant form of revenue available to film producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that we will hear from the hon Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) at some point
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
in the debate and that he will tell us, as I now remark, that in 1981–elect Committee looked hard at the point. It, too, in line with almost everybody in the industry, concluded that a form of recycled money or levy on what might be regarded as the modern equivalent of cinema audiences was essential and highly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background. Virtually everyone who knows and cares about the film industry says the same thing—we need this replacement mechanism. The real question is: how is it to be done? The problem arises because the film producing industry is the victim of what might be described as technological and social changes. We are familiar with industries whose products become obsolete and demand for them declines, which do not keep up with the market or are superseded by new technology and so on. Opinions may vary according to the precise instances, but the rule of the free market is that such industries perish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demand for the film industry's product has not diminished. There is a voracious appetite for production and an intense interest in films. The methods by which those products are marketed and sold to the public have changed for social and technological reasons. The irony is that those changes benefit the film industry but are destroying it at the same time. That is the dilemma which I invite the Minister to recognise and confront. The film industry is still producing a highly marketable and widely demanded product, but something has happened to the chain of relationships by which the film is eventually provided to the consumer. That chain has become elongated and distorted in curious ways which means that the person who in the end views the film is not paying the fair price necessary to stimulate further production of sufficient quality and volume.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the ways in which people view films. At present, people can go to the cinema and we know from the figures that cinema audiences are falling rapidly and are at a low level. The Minister's PPS is not helping in that regard, as is demonstrated by his sheepish expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that that is a completely irreversible position. We can rebuild and attract audiences back to the cinema. That is why I intervened when the end of the levy was mentioned. If we followed the successful examples of the United States and France where private enterprise, recycled money and Government help have made cinemas more attractive, there would be increases in cinema audiences. But we must be realistic. Because of other developments, cinema audiences will never reach the thousand millions that they were annually which would provide the basis for something such as an Eady levy to recycle money back to film producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People now watch films on television screens in the comfort of their own homes. Those films are either broadcast by the television companies or played on video recorders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

back through the Eady levy in those halycon days before the invention of television?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall come to that later when I discuss whether a levy on television companies would be an appropriate way of raising money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful about assuming that what has happened in the past necessarily provides an adequate guide to what would be appropriate today. As in so much of British industry, it is extremely difficult to go back to a benchmark set when the industry was an expanding, successful and cultural ambassador for this country around the world. At almost any point, one could go back and say that what was provided then, although better than now, was inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have to do a quick mental calculation to try to identify the exact sums to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. I should counsel against simply expressing the old Eady levy in modern day prices. Television companies provide sums of money of that sort, for reasons that I shall explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Eady levy was removed for practical reasons. However, the principle remains, and if that is still accepted—the Minister must come clean about whether he accepts the principle—the only problem is in finding a means of following the new equivalent of the old cinema audiences and of ensuring that an adequate return to the film producers is made through the people who sell the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that film producers have to be remunerated fairly. The hon. Gentleman said that in a rigged market it is extremely difficult to achieve a fair price. But they should get as near as possible to a proper market price for the films that they produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only in their interests that we argue for the recycling mechanism. We want to ensure that not only individual film producers get a proper reward, but that the industry as a whole is provided with investment capital to ensure that it continues to produce the product that is so rapidly snapped up by television and video cassette companies. It is in the interests of the whole industry—the television and video cassette companies as well as the film producers—and the interests of consumers that money shold go in at the production end to ensure that people can see films in whichever is their chosen medium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw here on my own relatively brief experience in current affairs television. We should all know just how voracious a medium television is. It is gobbling up film at a rate that exceeds many times the number of films produced. At the present rate, we shall have a continual rerun of old films for the foreseeable future unless a way is found of continuing to supply an immensely buoyant market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clause 2 is not to preserve the Eady levy but to try to make sure that the Government are compelled to replace it with an adequate mechanism that will do the same, or a similar, job. The new clause opens up for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
Goverment the precise mechanism by which that is achieved. I simply want to inquire of the Minister whether he accepts that the Government have an obligation to something along these lines. We hope for a little more than a simple assurance. We are not proposing a precise mechanism for raising a specific sum. We would be content if the Minister accepted new clause 2, or something similar, and assured us that before the Bill is enacted there will be added to it an obligation on the Government to provide, either by a levy on the television companies, on cassettes, or in some other way, recyclable money for the industry. That would satisfy us and I hope that it would satisfy Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to transgress into the realm of new clause 4, which for reasons that I think I understand Mr. Crowther, you decided not to select, I will mention briefly some ideas that might be practicable if the Minister accepts the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to agree that the argument for doing something about blank cassettes is perhaps less to do with recycling money from within the industry than with problems of copyright and piracy. The Government are engaged in a review, but I hope that the Minister will not take refuge in that to avoid telling us whether he thinks a levy on blank cassettes is a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both for the reasons of good order, to which Mr. Crowther has drawn our attention, and for reasons of policy, I would not wish, at this stage, to place my largest bet on the levy on blank cassettes. I simply hope that the Minister will give us the benefit of his current thinking on the idea because I should be sorry to see it excluded as a means of raising money for the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend agree that were a levy to be placed on blank cassettes—I do not seek to trespass into new clause 4, Mr. Crowther—at least we should go some way towards picking up the problem of copyright and piracy by hitting the scource of piracy and copyright enfringement at its base. Such a levy would mean that there would be recycled into the industry a sum of money which would replace the damage that is being done by, for example, the pirating of programmes either from cable, BBC, ITV or by people buying or obtaining a cartridge containing a programme and making a series of further additions which were then parcelled out and passed round. Perhaps by the levy method, if the Government were to take that on board, we should go to the heart of the problem of piracy and hit the pirates before they got off the ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crowther. While not seeking to argue with your ruling, I should have thought that it was within the ambit of the Bill to consider how the product of a film production could be best protected.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with anything that the hon. Gentleman has just said, I am asking only that we keep a sense of proportion in these matters. We are not debating a copyright Bill nor are we debating a positive proposal to introduce a levy on blank cassettes but merely a proposal to allow or instruct the Minister at some other time to introduce appropriate legislation. I ask hon. Members to keep that in mind and attempt, at least, to keep fairly closely to the question in front of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of the points you have just made, Mr. Crowther. But for the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) I was about to move on to other possibilities for raising the money. If I may say so, with your permission, Mr. Crowther, my hon. Friend got it right that if the Minister were prepared to do something on piracy and copyright, one of the advantageous by-products would be a source of revenue for the film industry. For that reason, and for others which I shall move on to, I should prefer to place my reliance on other more obvious and direct means of raising money on a recycling basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the point about blank cassettes, I put it to him that it would not be vary helpful to the film industry when one bears in mind that the blank cassette, especially the shorter cassette, may be used to record something unrelated to the film industry, like home video making. It may be used as my hon. Friend said, for educational purposes or to record an opera, ballet or live theatre performance from television. Therefore, the diffusion of revenues should, in equity, go so widely that it may be a meaningless contribution, whether it be on copyright or to recompense for the viewer using a film.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure mat if we looked in more detail at this type of proposition we could direct the force of the measure more particularly at blank cassettes likely to be involved in recording films from television. However, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman has given, that is less to be preferred than other measures that might direct themselves more obviously to people watching feature films on television screens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should mainly consider the levy on television companies and pre-recorded cassettes. The case for a levy on television companies has been made substantially by the hon. Member for Hendon,
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
North (Mr. Grist), and I should like to reinforce some of his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must all accept that, unusually in our present economy, television companies are profitable concerns. It is perhaps no longer true to describe them as having licences to print money as in Lord Thomson's day. Nevertheless, there is a buoyancy about television revenues which we do not often find in other parts of the economy. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, that is recognised by the fact that the Government have looked at what seems to be the unjustifiable nature of the excess profit and say that they should have some of that back because of monopoly considerations. That goes to the heart of the matter. Should we be content to accept that the television companies are making fat profits, amongst other things through showing feature films on television, but not be concerned with the people who produce them? Should we be content for excess profits to be creamed off and put back into the Treasury coffers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the long-term acceptance of a recycling, re-distributive mechanism, there is an obvious opportunity for instituting a similar mechanism. When those excess profits are creamed off, the obvious recipients for them are the film producers who so largely contribute to the viewing figures of the television companies. I include the BBC in those television companies, although 1 concede that, by an oversight, new clause 2 does not mention the BBC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is back in there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understood what the hon. Gentleman said. He is not suggesting any additional levy, or that the present levy paid by the independent companies to the Treasury should have a film surcharge. He is suggesting that if the levy remains at its present rate, that should include a certain percentage that goes back to the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go into detail about the scheme at this stage. However, the hon. Gentleman has got it slightly wrong. The ITV levy on profits is calculated after taking into account a range of factors. In the levy that I am suggesting one of the factors taken into account would be the companies' obligation to pay this levy. That presumably reduces that element of excess profits which would then be subject to the existing levy. Therefore, while it would not be a case of penny for penny, pound for pound, there would be a clear relationship. As they paid the levy proposed here, their liability to the levy on excess profits would diminish, not necessarily exactly, but pro rata.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me that it should be related to the number of people who watch, not to the amount of profits? We all know what companies can do to minimise profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I happily endorse that, although new clause 2 leaves that open in the hope that maximum flexibility will encourage the Minister to look kindly on the general proposition.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
We have heard from the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) the extent to which our television screens are now dominated by feature films. About 30 a week are broadcast in Britain. The figure surprised me, but on reflection I realise that it must be true. A good feature film will attract between 5 million and 10 million viewers for one and a half to two hours, giving the independent companies a great opportunity for earning advertising revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hendon, North, said, the prices paid by the BBC and the ITV companies for broadcasting so valuable in its revenue-raising capacity is amazingly low. Even according to the ITV companies' own submision the average cost is in the lower tens of thousands of pounds per film— the hon. Gentleman suggested that it might be even lower. Anything below about £100,000 an hour for television broadcasting is a pittance—very much at the lower end of the scale of costs in broadcasting. The television companies are getting extremely cheap broadcasting. Because of the duopoly they can maintain that position, to their own considerable advantage but to the unfair disadvantage of those who produce the feature films in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The typical budget of £100,000 an hour is fine for the two prime networks, but does the hon. Gentleman not accept that BBC2, and especially Channel 4, cost far less than that per hour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I defer to the hon. Gentleman's greater experience and expertise in the matter. However, I believe that there is an irreducible minimum for in-house productions, and I should be surprised if that figure fell below about £50,000 an hour. For the sake of the record, I tell the Committee that the budget for the half-hour programme on which I used to work averaged about £25,000 per programme. It was by no means an expensive production, yet that budget was only for things specific to the programme, and included no overheads, salaries or other such costs. That relatively inexpensive form of programming nevertheless cost substantially more than £50,000 an
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
hour. On any reckoning the scheduling of feature films bought at very low prices is a very cheap and therefore profitable form of broadcasting. I think that we can all agree on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the important aspect of the argument is that the Minister should take on board the fact that there is a sort of television Rachmanism going on, and that the scandal requires examination, justification and— if there is no justification—rectification? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to be too cruel to the television companies and bite the hand that once fed me. No one suggests that any malevolence is involved. The television companies have made a natural, rational commercial response to a situation which they did not really create; they are simply the beneficiaries. However, the television companies have now become like parasitical mistletoe growing on a dying tree.
