<div class='page-header'><h1>Films Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Norman Lamont)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Films Bill, the Committee does meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
May I first say, Mr. Crowther, how pleased we are to have you as our Chairman, and how very much we are looking forward to the Committee, which I am sure will be most interesting.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must remind the Committee that there are two financial resolutions in con-nection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Committee Room. As a general rule, manu-script amendments will not be called. Furthermore, it is only right to remind the Committee that, ex-cept in unusual circumstances, I do not intend to select starred amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crowther. Can you clarify one issue? As with the Committee on the Cable and Broad-casting Bill, are you prepared for us to declare our interests at the beginning of the proceedings or should we declare them each day as we speak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If any hon. Member with an interest to declare does so at the beginning of our proceedings, that will be quite adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I wish to declare inter-ests that might clash with the proceedings of the Committee. I am a director of Airtime Publicity (Newsflash) Limited and a consultant with the Brit-ish Videogram Association, both of which might have dealings with the film industry. I am also a consultant to Communications Strategy, a public relations firm. Furthermore, there is my continued membership, with a producer's ticket, of the Asso-ciation of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, wish to declare an interest. I am a non-executive director of L.W.T. (Holdings) plc, which, of course, has within its remit, London Weekend Television. Furthermore, I am an unpaid governor—all the governors are unpaid—of the British Film Institute.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the remarks of the Minister of State in welcoming you to the Committee, Mr. Crowther. The Opposition also look forward to dealing with this interesting measure under your wise guidance. Furthermore, unlike Conservative Members, we have no financial interest to declare, although I believe that all of us share a deep and abiding interest in the future of the British film industry.<br><br>
At first sight, the amendment might seem to be no more than a probing amendment. In some respects it is just that. We want the Minister to tell us why at long last, and especially now, he has decided that the quota is to be abolished. It is particularly important that he should speak on the subject, because it was not widely canvassed on Second Reading despite its being one of the more important aspects of the Bill. We wish to have a full statement from the Minister as to why he has chosen to take this step at this time.<br><br>
As I say, it is more than a probing amendment be-cause it raises the wide question to which we shall no doubt return throughout our proceedings—that of the general ability of the British film industry to withstand the enormous commercial and cultural pressures from the immensely powerful American industry that it has faced in the past but which, on all the evidence, it will face to an even greater degree in the future. We have tabled the amendment because we believe that it would be unwise to leave the British film industry without any protection.<br><br>
The Committee is no doubt aware of the history of the quota. It was first introduced in, I think, 1927, since when it has had a pretty chequered history. It has at times required no less than 45 per cent. of films shown in British cinemas to be of British origin; we shall perhaps discuss later precisely what being a British film means. At other times, the quota has fallen as low as 15 per cent. and I believe that, when it was suspended, it was at that low figure. The power to suspend the quota was provided for the first time, I think, in the Films Act 1980, which renewed the period during which the quota operated in line with a series of earlier measures, and provided the quota that is to continue to run until 1985. However, for the first time, the Act also gave the Secretary of State power to suspend the quota. That power was exercised, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
took effect on 1 January 1983. We now have two years' experience of being without the quota, and it is now proposed in clause 1 that it should be finally abandoned.<br><br>
Few Opposition Members would argue for maintaining the former application of the quota. We would accept that over the years there have been many problems with its operation. Many of us have read with some amusement and interest of the various devices resorted to in earlier days in order to fulfil the quota—the famous quickie films, for example, which, according to legend at any rate, were shown to cinema cleaning ladies. However, we also recognise the more serious administrative problems arising from the application of the quota and having to grant wide-ranging exemptions. Clearly, those problems have in turn led to further problems in enforcing the quota, and there is much evidence in recent years to suggest that, even when it did operate, the quota was not being enforced because more and more exhibitors apparently found it difficult to comply with.<br><br>
Behind the more recent difficulties, a commercial argument was advanced by the exhibitors to the effect that if they were compelled to forego normal commercial considerations—and, by implication, the showing of popular blockbuster foreign imports, usually from America—and to show, by reason of statutory requirement, what are almost by definition less popular British films, they would suffer commercially and, as payers of the Eady levy, they would actually be reducing the sums of money raised by that levy to be redistributed back to the film industry. The argument, therefore, was that the quota was frustrating and inhibiting the operation of the Eady levy.<br><br>
One can see that so long as the Eady levy remained and was the major source of finance, although diminishing in real terms, the argument had some substance. Certainly it seems to have been an argument that weighed with the Cinematograph Films Council and perhaps, to some degree, with the Interim Action Committee when they considered the problems, but, with the proposed abolition of the Eady levy, it has now lost its substance. We are therefore forced back to the more general consideration of whether it is right or practicable to provide such protection for the British industry.<br><br>
Incidentally, the issue of the Eady levy and the commercial considerations underlying the doubts about the quota was relied on by the Secretary of State. I need hardly add that Opposition Members wish a speedy recovery. We should be delighted to see him, not necessarily in this Committee, but certainly in the House of Commons as soon as possible. During Committee proceedings on the Films Bill in 1980, he placed some reliance on this issue.<br><br>
I cannot resist the temptation to mention another issue that he raised in the same debate. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The problem is wide but it is a problem to which the film industry is particularly vulnerable, because many of the important people in it are so mobile in it. If, in five year's time, we manage to persuade some of those people to come back to live here; that it is right for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
them to invest or re-invest some of their high earnings in the British film industry, as, by doing so, they would make even more profit, we shall have achieved a great deal."</p></blockquote>
This is the crunch point—
<br><blockquote><p>" Important as the quota may be the Finance Bill has more effect on the British film industry than the Films Bill." —[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 8 May 1980; c. 72.]</p></blockquote>
No doubt, all Opposition Members would say a fervent, " Hear, hear " to that, but coming from the Government it sounded a little hollow in the light of subsequent events, and will doubtless raise something of a horse laugh in the industry.<br><br>
To come back to the admitted problems that have arisen in the administration of the levy, my feeling —I shall be interested to hear the Minister's
reaction to this—is that a perhaps unstated but important difficulty in
the administration of the quota, or its continued value and viability, has been the impact of our membership of the EEC and the obligations that we have been compelled to undertake by the treaty of Rome and the treaty of accession in relation to national and commercial interests in other parts of the EEC. There is clearly great difficulty in promoting a measure that is designed to protect the British film industry if we are prevented, in effect, from doing that. By force of our treaty obligations, any protection that we try to provide has to be extended to other EEC countries. One of the trade unions, or perhaps one of the producer associations, argued very convincingly that it is a little odd that a film made with Canadian finance, with a German film crew, on location in Italy, employing Swedish actors, could nevertheless be regarded as a British film and qualify for whatever protection or financial assistance may be provided. I shall therefore be interested to hear from the Minister to what degree that aspect has influenced the Government in their decision to abolish the quota.<br><br>
Having taken account of all the admitted difficulties, Opposition Members still feel profoundly uneasy that this protection has been swept away. We see and understand why the distributors and exhibitors may favour the removal of the quota. It is an unwelcome and—as they would argue—unnecessary limitation on their normal commercial judgment. However, it is significant that many of the producers' organisations, and certainly the trade union, the Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians, remain committed to at least some form of protection being retained for the British film industry.<br><br>
It is also significant that when the authorities whom the Government have consulted on this issue considered it, they found it difficult to give a clear answer. It is true that the Cinematograph Films Council, having set up a working party, recommended by a majority that the quota should be discontinued. However, that recommendation was only by a majority; it was by no means a clear-cut argument. The argument that it presented to the Government rested heavily on the link between the quota and the Eady levy, a link which will no longer exist if this legislation comes into effect.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Again, it is significant that the Interim Action Committee could not agree on whether the quota was still doing a useful job or on whether it should be abandoned. It was content simply to set out the arguments on either side. It reached no conclusion. So the general arguments for the protection of the film industry remain powerful, although the precise mechanisms may not necessarily be the right ones to achieve that objective.<br><br>
The problem is that although exhibitors will argue that this is essentially a comercial issue, the vulnerability of the British film industry does not arise simply because of commercial advantages to exhibitors in exhibiting American films. As has been repeatedly stated and recognised by virtually everybody involved in the British film industry, the whole structure of the industry leaves it wide open to—indeed, it is almost impossible for it to avoid—domination by American distributors and film producers.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
It is not a question of exhibitors looking at each case on purely commercial grounds to decide where the commercial advantage lies. A structure of arrangements and relationships has arisen in the industry that makes it virtually inevitable—unless some countervailing measure is taken—that Amercan films sweep the board. That inevitable conclusion is drawn from the Monopolies and Mergers Com-mission report on the film industry, which will be familiar to all Committee Members. That report firmly recorded its finding that distributors were dominated by three groupings, that exhibitors were dominated by two major groupings, and that television purchasers of feature films were dominated by a duopoly. Therefore, there is in no sense anything approaching a free market in which exhibitors can make normal commercial judgements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham (St. Helens South)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that a further danger comes with the syndication, as it were, of films, particularly if there is immense American control of the market? We could have syndication with the duopoly, which would further impair the distribution of British-made films.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that point adds to the picture that I am attempting to draw. It is widely accepted that an industry structured in such a way will make it very difficult for smaller inde-pendent, one might almost say British producers, to break down the existing patterns and structures which enable the Americans to have such a smooth ride into our market. Therefore, the commercial argument put forward by the exhibitors is not the major problem, it is the structure of the industry. The Government should take that into account and try to alter and modify that structure.<br><br>
An additional problem is that the ability of the British film industry to override those structural and commercial problems will be further weakened if the Bill eventually becomes law. The Bill sweeps away many props. I almost hesitate to say "props" because that has such an unfortunate ring in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
current climate established by the Government. But, nevertheless, some of the things operated in the past have helped the British film industry: the levy; redistributive measures of providing finance; tax allowances to encourage investment and direct public involvement through the National Film Finance Corporation and other bodies. However, all of them will be removed, diminished or modified in such a way as to greatly reduce their utility and value. We are not looking at a static situation. The dynamic is moving against the British film industry and making it more probable that the Americans will have a field-day and do what they will in the British market.<br><br>
Furthermore, there is the peculiar vulnerability of the British market to the American film industry arising not only out of our common language and cultural links with the Americans, but also from the financial structure of the way in which the Americans produce and market their films. The British film industry has to reckon on a major share of the American market to make a project viable. We have to recoup perhaps 30 or 35 per cent. of the takings from a film from the American market to make it viable.<br><br>
Americans have no such problem with the British market. The viability of their film productions depends entirely on whether they can sell in the United States. Either they recoup their costs there or they do not make the film—or it is a film which is not viable in that sense. When they turn to the British market, what they get is simply icing on the cake, because they can sell that film to the British market at a marginal cost.<br><br>
Therefore, in a real sense—not just from the cultural but the commercial viewpoint—there is almost an element of dumping, although I do not go so far as to say that. Nevertheless, the Americans can offload on to the British market films which have already covered their costs and are economically viable within an American context. Thus, earnings which they make in the British market are simply an additional and worthwhile acceptable bonus.<br><br>
There is also the argument—which I believe has been advanced to some extent by the Minister and some of his colleagues—that, despite all those pressures, there is a viable future for the British film industry, not so much as a producer in its own right but as a provider of services to American film producers, and to the American industry. That argument may have merit if the British film industry is seen only as an industry—if the aim is simply to sell so many feet of celluloid, to provide a certain number of jobs or a certain turnover. If that is the aim, so long as the dollar remains strong and the pound remains weak against it, there might be some future for the providers of services to an essentially American-based industry. However, that argument does nothing to meet the very real point which is of great concern to Opposition Members. We do not wish to regard the British film industry simply as an industry; it also has a major cultural dimension. Therefore it is vital that, quite apart from whether it generates a certain amount of business or a certain number of jobs, it should show in our cinemas, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0382">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
as widely as possible throughout the world, British films depicting themes, values and aspects of British life. It should show those things which are of interest to the British people, and to use a Gaullist phrase, films that have a cultural radiance which greatly outweighs financial and commercial considerations. Unless we can help to provide the conditions in which the British film industry can meet those objectives, the Americans will sweep away all before them.<br><br>
A further worrying matter relates to the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984. I believe that some of my hon. Friends sat on the Committee stage of that legislation in the previous Session of Parliament. Section 7(2(b) and (c) of that Act imposed on the cable authority the obligation, when deciding to whom licences should be awarded, to require licensees to increase the proportion of material shown through cable, originating from within the EEC. That is perhaps an unfortunate enlargement of the protection to cover the EEC. Nevertheless, that was the provision; it was also required that the performers involved in such material should be nationals of the EEC. In other words, only a few months ago the Government wrote into a new Bill —which dealt with a new form of the transmission of feature films as well as other material—a requirement that that consideration should be enshrined in law and that the cable authority should pay attention to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My memory—which is all I can turn to in respect of the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984—tells me that the provision was not the imposition of a quota but was merely advice to the authority to encourage British and EEC originating material. That is quite different from a quota.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. I did not try to suggest that the provision took the form of a quota imposed on the cable industry. However, while we are not wedded to a quota of any given size or even necessarily a quota mechanism as such, we are extremely alarmed at the complete removal under the Bill of any protection, any principle or acknowledgement that the matter is important.<br><br>
The contrast which I make is between the cavalier attitude demonstrated in the Films Bill and that of the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 in which the issue was regarded as important enough to require the cable authority to take it into account when awarding licences. It is not quite the permissive measure which the hon. Gentleman suggests. I am concerned about the disparity between the Government's attitude in respect of cable and their attitude in respect of film. Moreover, if we allow the Government to go ahead with a Bill which deliberately excludes any such consideration, what will the precedents be for those other wide-ranging and fast burgeoning industries involved in cable and direct broadcasting by satellite? If the Government are not willing to provide protection for the successor or body to the NFFC, or for the television companies or cinema exhibitors, even in the form of a legally enshrined principle, we shall need to question
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
the operation of that principle in the Cable and Broadcasting Act.<br><br>
I am sure that the Committee is now clear about the thrust of my argument. I am not so concerned about the practical efficacy of the quota system as we have known it. What I fear from the Government's sweeping away of the quota, the register and so on, is that the psychological spur to the exhibition of British films will have been removed. The British film industry has worked for 60 years under the notion that there is some merit in continuing to show a reasonable proportion of British films. That will have gone.<br><br>
We are all familiar with the argument as to whether the law can change attitudes. I believe that it can. If there is a legal requirement, to show a particular proportion of British films, it will affect the way in which people go about their business. It will have a psychological effect on whether British films have a value.<br><br>
It is perhaps not a totally unconnected fact that as the quota has come to an end, so the British film industry has run into its most difficult period since its inception. The number of British films produced is at an historically low level.<br><br>
We should all like to see the British film industry flourish, but the Government are signalling to the industry that British films are no longer commercially viable or of cultural value. It is wrong to give the industry that signal. I urge the Minister to accept that the continuing principle of protection for the British film industry should be enshrined in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). This is a good point at which to start the Committee stage of the Bill. We are discussing how best the Government can encourage the creation of British films, if the Government want to. We shall some back to that question time and time again.<br><br>
I also welcome the feeling that much of this Committee's debate will not be party political. I believe that we are all basically wedded to the one ideal of improving the state of the home-grown British film industry. We may have various ways of going about it and that will be discussed, but I hope that none of us will adopt a dogmatic approach.<br><br>
We are deciding whether there should be a legal requirement, as the hon. Member for Dagenham said, to show British films in British cinemas. That has to mean an imposed quota. It is not capable of being dressed up in any other way. If a legal requirement is imposed on cinema owners or exhibitors to show British films, they are stuck with it.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of the rather disastrous effects of the imposed quota on the British film industry in the past. I am thinking back to the quota quickies—those supporting pictures of the 1940s and 1950s which were of dubious quality in terms of the acting and excitement involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shame! Wihdraw!</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0383">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, who perhaps it would be cruel to say should have declared an interest earlier, is barracking me! Of course there were some very good quota quickies; I acknowledge that immediately. But as with any spontaneous invention it was a chancy business. I suggest that most quota quickies were made to fulfil the legal requirement to put on British films in British cinemas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the quality of acting has improved from that in the quota quickies of the 1950s—in which I believe the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) may have had a minor part—and that we may not face the same problems today?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question, but I would put it another way. If we consider the history of the cinema and the theatre, we see that the style of acting has changed. When my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) was performing before the cameras in the quota quickies, he was probably directed rather differently from how he would be nowadays. There is a more naturalistic approach. So if his perfor-mance—as a minute infant, I believe—looked a little stylised, we must blame the style of the day rather than the actor's talent.<br><br>
However, I return to the theme of quotas, which I feel is important. I do not believe that such a limitation on the film industry is realistic or sensible in today's climate, and I shall try to explain why. First, such a limitation is impossible in view of the number of films being made in Britain at present. Even quota quickies would cost an investor a considerable amount of money today—probably £1 million-plus even for lower-budget films. We are not talking merely about the £200,000 or £300,000 film lasting perhaps an hour and twenty minutes and screened as a way of filling the cinemas.<br><br>
The money has to come from somewhere. If a quota were imposed and the British film industry had to make British films just for showing in British cinemas, there would be little prospect of such films paying their way. I suppose that the hon. Member for Dagenham is suggesting that the Government—in other words, the taxpayers, many of whom, regrettably, are not interested in going to the cinema; that is one reason why we are debating this subject—would have to foot the bill for the films made under the quota. That depresses me infinitely.<br><br>
It might be argued that a quota would benefit young film makers who are learning their trade, and help them to climb the ladder, but that is not necessary nowadays. There is a vast television industry, with many people making films for Channel 4, for example. Many former pupils of the National Film and Television School—which is highly successful in educating those who intend to work in the in-dustry—start in television by making films for Channel 4, which leads them to the big screen cinema. Therefore I do not believe that the argument about training is tenable.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Again, if a quota is imposed it can be got round; that has been proved beyond doubt. Indeed, the hon. Member for Dagenham mentioned that in the past it was possible for an American company to form another company in this country with a majority of British directors and then have a film made partly here. Provided that the broad figure of 75 per cent. was adhered to, it became a British film. That had a twofold effect. First, it qualified for quota although it was American inspired and possibly had American stars and so on. Secondly, it meant that the Eady money went to that American company. That is another problem with the old system of Eady money.<br><br>
When I was in New York about three years ago with the Select Committee, an American executive reminded me that if we wished to save some Eady money for the British film industry, our first step would be to close the loophole whereby big American production or distributing companies could take their whack of Eady out of this country. I want to help the British film industry and do not believe that a quota system which will produce all those problems and solve none is the right way to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand the point that I am about to make, as I made it at length in my speech. His argument in respect of the effect of the Eady levy in con-junction with the quota will lose its validity if the Bill is enacted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course, I acknowledge that. I was merely referring back rather than forward.<br><br>
We must find other ways of dealing with the matter. I am delighted to have this early oppor-tunity to ask a question on which I should like the Minister's comments right away. Do the Govern-ment want British, home-based feature films made for cinema production? If so, I believe that they must do more than the Bill provides for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the speech of the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) and to echo his remarks.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee can approach its dis-cussions in a spirit of seeking after truth rather than confrontational politics. I am sure that with good-will from the Government, we shall be able to bring some improvements to the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) moved the amendment, which is partly a probing one. The basic point of principle is that if the Bill offered a sensible and realistic base of financial support for the British film industry, a quota system would be unnecessary. Our amendment seeks to probe the Government's thinking about the removal of the quota system. So long as the remainder of the Bill is inadequate with regard to the protection and support being offered to the film industry, we are worried about the effect of its withdrawal. In the face of international competition, especially from the American film industry, the British film industry needs extra and special protection and support.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0384">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Our amendment is about the ability to withstand commercial competition from abroad.<br><br>
I refer to what was said about commercial competition in the White Paper. Two references were made in the early pages. Paragraph 1.2 refers to the renaissance year of 1983 in the British film industry. Much was made of that during the Goveminent's introduction of the legislation although there are differences of opinion about the nature of that renaissance. The White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The signs of renaissance were clear—production levels were being sustained and "—</p></blockquote>
that is the important point—
<br><blockquote><p>"in the all-important North American market there was a much greater acceptance of British film than ever before, as 'Gandhi' followed 'Chariots of Fire ' as an Oscar winner."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that if British film is successful abroad and biting into the all-important American market for distribution and exhibition, the take that British film is naturally making in the home market is also bound to be high.<br><br>
Paragraph 24 2.4 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The last two decades saw a decline in the numbers of long films … registered as British: from a level in the 1960s of about 70 a year to only 27 in 1982."</p></blockquote>
Then, of course, the annus mirabilis of 1983 appeared:
<br><blockquote><p>" However, 1983 saw an improvement, with 34 films registered during the year."</p></blockquote>
That was an improvement of seven on 1982.<br><br>
The White Paper states in good faith that there appears to be a sort of a renaissance in the showing of British films in Britain. That may be partially true, but the reasons for a renaissance are largely connected with financial factors relating to capital tax allowances and the balance between the pound and the dollar, and have little to do with the nature of support given to the British film. So we cannot be too confident when considering the industry's ability to withstand foreign competition and to enter into the British film market and take a natural share without any sort of umbrella or protection through a quota system.<br><br>
We have only to look back a couple of years to the announcement of the Minister then responsible for the film industry, Mr. lain Sproat, that he was suspending the regulations on the quota system. His speech to the House was quite instructive. It identified the problem but did not make a logical connection between the problem and the solution then adopted.<br><br>
Mr. Sproat told the House:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have been considering the continuing value of the provisions of the Films Act 1960 which impose upon cinema exhibitors the obligation to show a certain percentage of British or Community films and to keep records and make returns. I have consulted the Cinematograph Films Council and I am aware of the views of the industry generally and of the film unions.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I have decided the quota requirements are no longer necessary ".</p></blockquote>
That was the point at which the then Minister suspended the regulations by administrative decision. The Bill aims to remove the legislative framework
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
within which those regulations were established, and our amendment seeks to probe the details of that removal.<br><br>
Mr. Sproat continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"and I therefore intend to bring forward an order under section 7 of the Films Act 1980 to suspend them as from 1 January 1983."</p></blockquote>
Now comes the extremely instructive point:
<br><blockquote><p>" Taking into account the parlous state of the film industry and the serious shortage of films, I do not think the behaviour of exhibitors in showing all the British or Community films they can will change, but they will be relieved of a formidable and unnecessary administrative burden"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 20 July 1982; Vol. 28, c. 100–101.1</p></blockquote>
In effect, the Government's statement then differs greatly from what they say in the White Paper. There is no talk now of a renaissance or of the great year of 1983 that was about to dawn and produce the blockbusters that would save the British film industry.<br><br>
In the previous year, the Government said that the British film industry was in a parlous state. Despite that, they announced that they intended to scrap the quota requirements. I wholly agree with what the Minister said then about formidable and unnecessary administrative burdens. A quota system is a clumsy and complicated mechanism for ensuring protection. As the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) pointed out, the distributors have the capacity to get round the quota imposition.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Further, as has been pointed out, there is the difficulty of deciding what qualifies as a British film because of the different components that go towards making up a film. I accept that the quota system as it used to operate was a clumsy and not very effective mechanism. but the Opposition stress that, if the legislative basis of the quota system is simply removed without any realistic replacement to nurture and protect the British film industry, we are heading for the worst of all possible worlds. That, I fear, is what the Government are about in the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) mentioned the way in which the film industry can withstand economic and commercial competition from abroad and, in particular, how the cultural impact of American films may begin to dominate the market for films, in Britain. What I do not want to see is a future where the only successful British films can be those that mimic and adopt the techniques and styles of north American film-making. I sincerely hope that that will not be the future of our film industry.<br><br>
The cultural and commercial impact of competition from abroad is very strong indeed, particularly from the dominating and powerful north American production system and marketing network. We have to ensure that there is proper protection for the British film industry.<br><br>
As we go further into the Bill and into the meat of the decisions on how British films can be promoted, the Government may come forward with better proposals than they have to date and then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0385">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
a quota system will no longer be needed. But, so long as protection is not enshrined in the Bill, the Opposition are right to be worried about what may happen if the quota system disappears altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not in-tended to speak, but some of the remarks made by the hon. Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), as well as by my hon. Friend the Member for Graves-ham (Mr. Brinton) call for comment.<br><br>
There is something unsatisfactory about calling the Bill the Films Bill. It would be much more appropriate if we called it the Cinematograph Films Bill. The distinction is important because the speeches that we have heard so far have covered films for television and for the cinema, and I believe that the Bill deals with films for the cinema which may also subsequently be used for television. Unless that is clear at the outset, we may be blurring an important distinction.<br><br>
I preface my remarks with that observation be-cause, although hon. Members are right to discuss the quota, I believe that their priorities are wrong. We do not need a quota because the films have been made and therefore financed. Our problem is not the showing of films but the making of them. That depends upon finance. That is the guts of the issue.<br><br>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) served a valuable purpose because of the discussion which arose but a quota is not relevant because having the films to meet it depends upon finance.<br><br>
I shall express the issue more graphically. For many years, employers have been required to use the services of the registered disabled, but employers do not use their services for the simple reason that there are not enough registered disabled to fill the jobs for which they have been officially registered. The same applies in the film industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clement Freud (Cambridgeshire, North-East)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the real reason that there has been no policing of the employment of registered disabled, just as there has been insufficient policing of the quotas in the film industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When, on another occasion, the Employment Committee examined this matter, it was not so much a question of policing as the non-availability of the registered disabled. In this con-text it is not so much the question of a quota as the ability to make films. That is the parallel.<br><br>
I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham said. He invited my hon. Friend the Minister, to come clean on a point that is crucial to our discussions: do the Government believe that we need a British cinema film industry? I am clear that the Minister and the Government believe that we need a film industry that will supply pro-ducts for television via satellites, cables and the other ways of showing video cassettes. But let my hon. Friend say whether he believes that there is something special, unique and desirable about a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
British film industry that supplies products for the cinema; then we shall know where we stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps those of us who had the pleasure of serving on the Cable and Broad-casting Bill—one sees some friendly faces from those days in Committee—may repeat the simple exercise that was performed then in this Committee. A group of people who cared about the industry went to work to improve what was basically a badly drafted Bill. The outcome, as is well known to the House, was an improved Bill. That the Minister who served with us on the Cable and Broadcasting Bill then left for Northern Ireland should not be taken as a precedent by the Minister that after this Bill he will go somewhere else. I mention that so that he will not approach the Bill with this trench-like attitude of mind: the Government have written, therefore the law must stand. That would be a death knell to the British cinematographic industry.<br><br>
I accept, as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said, rightly, that there is a clear distinction to be drawn between films made for the cinema screen and those made for showing on television, cable or other productions. If we approach the matter in an all-embracing brief we run a real risk of losing sight of the fact that there is an opportunity for the Government to take a clear lead and say, through the Bill, whether they believe in an industry which distributes British films for the cinema. I believe, as, I am sure, do many members of the Committee, that it is necessary for us to have our own film industry and for it to be able to make the films which we are capable of making and for which we can secure worldwide distribution. When I refer to the " cinema industry " henceforth, I shall draw that real distinction, which I seek.<br><br>
The tragedy is that the point of distribution has fallen basically into the hands of two major companies in this country. That is dangerous in respect of distribution. The Minister shakes his head. Per-haps we can develop the argument—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Laimont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only point at which I shook my head was when the hon. Gentleman said that that was the only problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That road to Damascus will open up again. The Minister is saying already that there are other problems so perhaps he will en-lighten us and perhaps a conversion will take place in due course. The Bill as drafted merely enhances the dangers and that worries us.<br><br>
I am not a great lover of quotas. I do not think the quota system is the best solution, but that is all we have at the moment. Although it has been suspended at the moment, it can be brought back into operation at any time. However, the Bill seeks to remove it. I do not believe that that is sensible at this stage. Perhaps if proper financing arrangements were available to the cinema industry, there would be no need for a quota. The first question that must be answered by the producer of a potential film is whether, first, it will be distributed, and, secondly, whether the market will be such as to give a return on the investment. Films do not grow
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
out of the ground like corn. They must be made and financed. Finance is fundamental.<br><br>
If one looks at the world cinema industry one begins to see that, with the exception of the United States and Japan, there are considerable advantages in making films, for example, in France, Italy, Denmark, Greece or any other major film-producing country. In every case there is some Government support. However, there is no longer any Government support for the British film industry. Previous tax advantages were removed by the last Budget and there is no other form of funding except for a pitiful amount that will back the new film finance corporation if the Bill stands as drafted.<br><br>
You may ask yourself, Mr. Crowther, why the Americans and Japanese do not need the advantages that the French, Belgian, or Danish film makers have. The reason is the nature of the market. In America there is a very large market and it has been said rightly that at the end of a run in the American market a film has paid for itself. Therefore, people are encouraged to finance the making of feature films for the cinema by way of loan or investment. However, that does not exist in this country.<br><br>
I intervened in the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and made that point. I am worried that the domination of the distributive sources in this country by EMI and Rank means that sometimes they tend to show only films that have already proved successful. We understand that in a falling market of potential customers. We know that cinema audiences have declined steadily, not only during the past few years but since the 1930s. A cinema is a capital object that costs money to run and maintain and the films shown in it will be those that are believed to attract audiences. If a film has had a successful American or continental run and has a track record, the chances of attracting an audience are enhanced. That is a simple commercial argument. That was the argument made by both Rank and EMI. They said that as they had large capital assets, they would show that particular type of film.<br><br>
The British film has the problem of trying to break into the market and of being screened here. Unless it is successful here, its chances in the American market are that much diminished. It has to be shown here if we are to begin repaying the refunding of the film. That film has not the advantages of the American system, but it is having to break into those markets. Rank and EMI have to be persuaded to screen it.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
There is the other great disadvantage. Films are often bought by one of the distributing groups and shown only in its cinemas. That means that the independent cinemas do not get the film for some time thereafter.<br><br>
Against all that is bankruptcy. That is a primary problem. How are the films to be funded? ACTT approached several financial institutions to see whether they would invest more in British films and to ask what put them off the British market at present. Those institutions replied that they were worried
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
about the double duopoly—the hold over the film market by Rank and EMI and the duopoly in the television market of ITV and BBC.<br><br>
The fundamental question behind the issue is that posed by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton). He asked whether the Government believed in a British cinema industry. If the answer is yes, the next logical question is how are we to arrange its funding. We all have several suggestions. After the funding question, we have to decide how we should help the industry to develop and grow. The industry has been contracting over the years. I do not accept that an increase from 27 to 34 in the number of films produced in a year is a renaissance. It may be the first light in spring, but none of us ever accept that spring has arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not optimistic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is showing his lack of optimism again. I am becoming even more anxious to hear what he will say. We do not accept that spring has arrived simply because the first few swallows have arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend reflect that it is more like a day without snow in winter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend may have a point. I am always amazed to see the snowdrops push through the snow in January and February when I know that spring has not arrived.<br><br>
The increase from 27 to 34 films in a year is not the sign of a renaissance. It is a sign that we manage to make 34 films. It is nothing more than that. We have the potential, the scripts, the producers and the technicians to make a lot more than 34 films in a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if the Minister said that he believed in the film industry, but did not want to put too much money into it, it would be rather like asking the Secretary of State for Transport whether he believed in a railway system and he said, yes, but he was prepared to finance only the train?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. If the Minister says that he believes in the British film industry, perhaps he will be willing to show how the funding resources for it can be developed. After all, 34 films in a year do not represent an industry; they are the start of an industry. We have the potential to develop the industry. In the Bill we have the opportunity to set up the means whereby that industry can be developed, and I hope that the Minister will not waste the opportunity. I hope, too, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, that the Committee, in its collective wisdom, will not adopt a party-line, trench-warfare approach. If the Committee adopts a broad approach, we shall be able to show as a collective body that we have the interests of the British film industry at heart and that we as a Committee intend to have a British film industry and, more particularly, that it be funded properly and given a chance to grow. In that way, the White Paper's renaissance can turn into a summer of content.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare my interest, first, as a consultant to Shaw Cable and, secondly, as a holder of a current producer and director's ACTT ticket.<br><br>
I wish to put on record one point only at this stage of our proceedings, and that is my disagreement with the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) that this is a cinema Bill, not a Films Bill. I hope that I shall carry with me the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who has also made films and television programmes, when I say that I see no particular merit in film for the sake of film. I see much merit—no doubt, we shall develop this aspect later —in the desirability of maintaining an independent cinema circuit. I see much technical merit in the difference between film quality—and, therefore, the desirability of maintaining film and television quality, which are two different things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow my hon. Friend's argument, but does he envisage a situation in which films will be made for television and subsequently shown in cinema?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for this intervention is that later in our proceedings both sides of the Committee will suggest the introduction of some form of levy on films shown on television as an integral part of the Bill. It would be wrong to pre-empt that discussion now and give independent television programme contractors the impression that we re-quire them to fund another industry. We shall be asking them to fund an industry in which they, too, have a vested interest. For that reason—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Crowther, for interrupting the hon. Gentleman as he was about to sit down, but does he not agree that at present about 85 per cent. of film production in Britain is not for theatrical distribution, and that an enormous percentage of that is for television production? The two mechanisms of film distribution are closely interlinked, with many companies engaged in both enterprises. Does he not, therefore, agree that it would be absurd to try to divorce them completely?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. That is why it is important to state now that the industry that we seek to fund is very much a joint industry. Thus there is no particular merit in film other than its artistic quality. The television companies, when asked to pay, will be paying for something that they, in turn, will have use of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I admired very much the ingenuity of the arguments that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) deployed in trying to find a reason for keeping the quota. I enjoyed listening to the far-ranging arguments and subjects that he raised.<br><br>
I agree with the argument that has been put several times this morning, and also on Second Reading, that we are not just talking about another industry, another economic activity, and that it is not enough merely to bring another economic theory to bear on this one industry. I take that point. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
should apply equally to the hon. Member for Dagenham's contribution. I hope that he will not apply theories of protection or quota to this industry just because they are theories. At times, the hon. Gentleman gave a slight impression of having some instinctive sympathy with those arrangements, although he deployed many arguments against the quota system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene so soon in the Minister's speech but, simply for the record, I must say that I am not one of those who instinctively support protection as a means of promoting industrial interests. On the other hand, it is important that where there are wider-ranging considerations we should be prepared to look at all measures to achieve desirable objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. I was merely commenting on the impression that he appeared to give, particularly when he accused me of bringing economic theory unrelated to the industry to bear on it. I assure the hon. Gentleman, as I tried to assure the House on Second Reading, that whatever one thinks of the suggestions that we have made, our motive has been to find solutions to the industry's problems.<br><br>
There has also been some argument in our debate about the state of the British film industry. I hope that we shall not have endless to-ing and fro-ing on both sides as to whether it is having a depressed period or a boom period. We were accused of claiming great credit for some of the British film industry's achievements. Certainly its achievements are due to the industry itself—to its producers' and the individuals' talents. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) implied that we had been giving a misleading impression of what is going on in the industry. Mr. Dartnall the chairman of British Film Year and managing director of Thorn EMI remarked only the other day:
<br><blockquote><p>" We are launching British Film Year at a time when British film production is booming. All of our studios are full and have bookings many months ahead. Our technicians are rightly regarded as the best anywhere and our facilities are permanently in demand. The quality of our product is evident in the awards lavished on our films in ceremonies all over the world."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'><i> rose</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I though that there might be an-other opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not so much an opinion as a question. Does the Minister know whether the statement that he has just quoted qualified itself by saying how many of those films were British?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only the statement that I read out. I heard Mr. Dartnall make it but I did not hear him make the qualification that my hon. Friend suggests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>:: To elucidate the quotation—while I accept what was said by the hon. Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale) a moment ago about the desirable unity of the industry, does the Minister know whether that remark was made in the context of films for showing in cinemas or, as is more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
likely, was directed towards the general business of making films for television?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lament</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is both, but the quotation clearly refers to production. However, I hope that we shall not spend all our time with one side of the Committee saying that the film industry is in a terrible state and the other—at least one part of it—saying that it is doing extremely well. That could take up a lot of our time. All I wanted to say was that some opinions have been expressed —they may or may not be accepted by everybody —and indeed, I could weary the Committee by reading out other quotations. There are those who think that there have been encouraging signs in the British film industry over the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist my hon. Friend the Minister by suggesting that if we can all agree that film making for television purposes is not doing too badly and that, except for the remarkable world-renowned film successes, film making for the cinema is not in quite the same category, we need not return to it, except to try to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not have my hon. Friend's great knowledge, I accept his general judgment, especially as he included the qualification that also there have been one or two remarkable successes among the films for the cinema industry.<br><br>
Of course we want a successful British film industry. The industry is very much a part of the culture of this country. We want to continue the tradition of making films in British studios about aspects of British life, not in a narrow, cultural sense, but to continue our great tradition of films that have been extremely successful not only in this country but in many parts of the world. We very much want that tradition to continue. I would have hoped that that could have been taken for granted.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Some may disagree about the methods that we are using to achieve that. Some may disagree about whether we are going far enough. However, it is our intention—our hope—that we can see a renaissance of the film industry in this country. As I first said, we do not regard the film industry as merely another industry. It is part of our culture. It is essential that we preserve it and that it should flourish and prosper.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) would say, that fact leads me to questions such as what we intend to do about it, whether our policies are adequate and so on. There has been some argument among my hon. Friends about whether the Bill is adequately titled. However, the Bill is not about the capital allowances. In fact, I know that you, Mr. Crowther, would quickly rule me out of order if I went on to say why I thought that the tax regime being established for—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Mr. Crowther.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is absolutely right. I shall rule him out of order if he goes any further along that line. The Minister used intelligent anticipation in surmising that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful indeed for that restriction. Suffice it to say that I would not accept that the anxieties expressed by the industry on the point are quite as well founded as has been stated. I know that there is anxiety on these matters, but I believe that they are overdone. When that is taken into account and place alongside the funding that we will make available to the NFFC, which will mean that it will then have twice its former resources for British film making, I believe that we can say that the measures in the Bill will enable the industry to prosper and that they square with our objective that the industry ought to be successful. We very much want to preserve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that the Government are in favour of a prosperous and successful film industry. Will he go a little further and say that he would be prepared to listen to the views expressed? At this stage, I ask no more than that. Is he prepared to listen to the views expressed by those within the film industry and members of the Committee about the adequate level of funding of the NFFC? Moreover, having listened and considered those views, is he prepared to take on board such suggestions that might be made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am prepared to listen, not only on that point but on many others. I begin to feel that I am a relative stranger in the Committee. Indeed, surrounded as I am by hon. Friends who have considerable experience of the industry, I would be a remarkably bold man if I said that I was not prepared to listen. Of course, I am so prepared. Moreover, I am sure that all our debates will be an educational experience for me. I am anxious to hear the views of the Committee on many points in the Bill. If there are things that we can sensibly do to improve the Bill, of course we shall give them the fullest possible consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorse</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening again. While the Minister is discussing boldness, will he be bold enough, even at this stage, to say in respect of the film industry—I revert to my analogy—whether he is a one-train man or a train system man? In other words, will he give us an idea of the size of the film-making industry for the cinemas that he envisages? Does he think that the level of support of financing from Government sources should be sufficient for half a film a year or for ten and a half films a year? What is the size that he envisages? I ask him to be bold.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend would be amazed if I answered that question in the terms in which he put it. I have said that it is my belief that the finance that we have got together will enable us to, have an industry which is successful and prosperous. My hon. Friend knows that the present NFFC has used
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
its money not necessarily to finance whole films but as the last money or first money used in conjunction with other people's money. That is why it is difficult to say what the resources that we are making avail-able to the sum of the NFFC will mean in terms of numbers of films. That takes one into the realms of speculation, but I want to see a flourishing, successful British film industry that is as large as possible. I am afraid that I cannot go beyond that in specific terms.<br><br>
Let me now deal with the subject of the amendment, the screen quota. As the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), said, this was introduced in 1927. The level of quota was set each year by the Secretary of State on the advice of the Cinemato-graph Films Council. For first feature films the level in 1938 was 12·5 per cent., in the early 1940s it was 15 per cent. and it was raised to 45 per cent. in 1948. In subsequent years it was reduced to 40 per cent. in 1949, 30 per cent. in 1950 and 15 per cent. in 1982. The quota for supporting programme films remained at 25 per cent. from 1948 and was also reduced to 15 per cent. in 1982. The answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury is that the quota was suspended indefinitely from January 1983.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked how the quota inter-acted with our membership of the EEC. The European Communities Act 1972 extended the provisions to allow Community films to be treated on equal terms with British films for quota purposes and plans made in accordance with co-production agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries were also treated in this way.<br><br>
Another aspect of the quota was that the legislation provided for every cinema in the country to keep a quota record book in which full details of films shown were entered week by week, including playing times. The certified books were returned to the Department at the end of each year where they were checked for accuracy and quota achievement. Over the past 10 years the number of cinemas failing to achieve the quota increased. In 1981 it was about 24 per cent. Although quota defaults are punishable under the Films Act 1960 no prosecution has taken place for over 25 years.<br><br>
Various representations about the effectiveness of the system and the burden of the record-keeping were received, long before we got into this argument in our White Paper and Bill, prior to 1981. That led to my right hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) suspending the operation of the quota in 1980.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freud</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that the 24 per cent. of cinemas in 1981 that did not return the forms, which he claim is a figure which has in-creased, is merely the same number of cinemas and that a vast number have closed since then? Does he take my point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with that; I should like to check on it. However, even if the hon. Gentleman is right, that does not alter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
the main part of the argument, which I shall come to.<br><br>
A major part of our policy towards the film industry is that we want to remove from the cinema the burden of outdated and unnecessary legislation. Clause 1 does precisely that, but in effect the amendment seeks to restore the whole panoply of regulations designed to support the quota system. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred to that system as being clumsy and complicated, and my hon. Friend the Member for Grave-sham (Mr. Brinton) described some of its effects, and anticipated the distortions and perhaps rather bad films which might be produced if it continues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham said that he had read the reports of the debates that took place when the quota was first reduced to 15 per cent. and then suspended a year later. The background against which those decisions were taken was the need to allow cinemas to operate in their best commercial interests faced with declining cinema attendances; against that, the quota was seen as pro-viding support to British film production. It was argued that removal of the quota would not influence the behaviour of exhibitors, who could continue to play British films whenever they could get them. That view is cinfirmed by the quota achievement figures for the final year, when it was reduced to 15 per cent. from 30 per cent. The average quota in 1982 for first-feature films was 28 per cent, a minimal change compared with the maximum requirement of 15 per cent.<br><br>
I feel that the idea of a quota is, essentially, out of date. It is a form of protection that would not really achieve anything for the industry. We have received absolutely no representations from the industry for the retention of the quota—indeed, I was somewhat surprised that the hon. Member for Dagenham should have tabled the amendment—but of course there may have been representations from the trade unions.<br><br>
Again, I believe that the quota is an unsuitable form of protection. As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, it is clumsy and heavyhanded. It would not lead to what we all want in the cinemas—good British films. I am quite pre-pared to discuss how they should be provided and the money to be made available. However, although we can try to ensure that good British films are made, we cannot force people to watch them. After all, the cinema is one area where there should be freedom of choice. We do not want to see cinema screens being filled with films that people would not watch unless they were compelled to do so; that would not be a worthy argument. We want the best possible industry, but such a course would not help it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham spoke about the structure of the industry. I do not necessarily disagree with his analysis of the degree of monopoly in it. However, merely because there is a monopoly problem in the industry does not prove that there-fore there should be a quota arrangement. The answer to a monopoly is to introduce a greater degree of competition and to consider the findings of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, not to introduce quotas. That would not be the right answer to the problem.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984 and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham answered his question effectively. That Act refers not to a quota system but to general guidance and a means of communication that is licensed by the Government. So that is a completely different matter. The debate has been interesting but I believe that most of my hon. Friends are in favour of abolishing the quota system.<br><br>
Despite the ingenuity of the arguments put forward, it has not been shown that the quota system would help the British film industry. No representations have been made that it should be retained. There seems to have been a general welcome for getting rid of such bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming procedures that do little for the industry. I therefore recommend that the Bill should remain as drafted.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks, but it is worth putting on record that the ACTT said that it wished not only to support the continuance of the quota system but would like a more effective and far-reaching form of it. That is significant because it comes from a section of the industry which is clearly not aligned with the producers and distributors who probably have a different interest in the matter. If the Minister persists in quoting the chairman—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is not the chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—of Thorne/EMI as an authority on the film industry, we may have to draw attention to that distinction frequently.<br><br>
We have had a good debate on the amendment. The sentiments well expressed on both sides of the Committee augur for its future. There is already evidence of much common ground and concern about the well-being and future health of the industry.<br><br>
The Minister was kind enough to say that he envisaged his work with the Committee as being an educational process. That is a generous recognition on his part. But on the strength of some of the answers that he gave to hon. Members, I hope that his learning curve still has a long way to go. While he was prepared to pay some obeisance to general principles, he notably failed, for example, to answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst).<br><br>
There is some sense in the point raised initially by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) and echoed on both sides of the Committee. The quota is very difficult to apply because the industry does not produce the British films that would be required to fill the quota. We all accept that, but not as a ground for dismissing the matter. That is another illustration of the problems that exist in the industry to which the quota was being directed as a partial solution.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
If a proper framework and a financial, public involvement and Government commitment context were established, the quota could be met, but in some ways it would be otiose. Our amendment was principally a probing one and we recognise that there are difficulties with the quota as a practical solution to the problem. But the problem exists and we must deal with it. Indeed, we could happily divert our attention from the quota if, in the course of the Committee's work, the Minister will accept what has been said by my hon. Friends and by some of his hon. Friends. Once that situation is established, we can look forward confidently to the future of the British film industry.<br><br>
We are not talking about a massive industry or an overnight transformation but about a real prospect of new growth, new heart and new commitment to the industry. As I said in my brief intervention in the Minister's speech, when we have that, we shall not need to bother about quotas.<br><br>
I am not one of those who think that protection is the answer to all our economic problems, either in the film industry or elsewhere. However, I believe that it is regrettable that we do not show the industry that we place a value on a proportion of British films being shown in our cinemas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that an analogy can be drawn between the British film industry at present and a young seedling in the spring which occasionally needs putting in a glasshouse to keep the frost away?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend's analogy is appropriate to other industries, too. It is an industrial analogy. Perhaps the film industry is not just a young seedling but a new, small sprout from an old tree that has died down.<br><br>
I do not wish to detain the Committee further, following a useful debate. Recognising, as we have from the outset, the continuing practical difficulties in applying a quota, I do not propose to press the amendment to a Division. On the other hand, I place considerable importance on the issues that will arise time and again during the work of the Committee. I give the Minister a friendly warning that the Opposition, at least, will not rest until we feel that we have pushed him to accept the importance and value of the financial and other measures which I am convinced are essential to the future of the British film industry.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdawn the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 6, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>" (2) In accordance with section (British Film Authority), there shall be, in place of the Cinematograph Films Council, a British Film Authority.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take new clause 5—British Film Authority—</span></p>
<p>(1) The Secretary of State shall by order made by statutory instrument establish within one year from the date of the passing of this Act a British Film Authority (referred to in this section as " the Authority ").

<ol>
<li>The Authority shall have vested in it, and shall re-port annually to the Secretary of State on its performance of, the following functions:</li>
<ol>
<li>the relevant film functions of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Education and Science and the duties hitherto performed by the Cinematograph Films Council.</li>
<li>the supervision of the National Film Finance Corporation and of any body with responsibilities towards the film industry set up by this or any other Act.</li>
<li>the administration of any arrangements provided by this or any other Act for the promotion of British films and of British cinemas.</li>
<li>the monitoring of the distribution and exhibition of films in cinemas, and of the progress made towards implementation of the recommendations of the 1983 Monopolies and Mergers Commission Report on Cinema Distribution and Exhibition.</li></ol>
<li>No order made under this section shall be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.</li>
<li>The Secretary of State may give financial assistance to the Authority; and any sums so spent shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament.</li></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already, in our first substantive debate, had an exchange of views about whether the film industry is in good health. I hope it is an augury for the future that, in that debate, there was a division of view between Opposition Members and many hon. Members on the Conservative Benches on the one hand and the Minister on the other.<br><br>
We can all accept that there are the odd one-off successes and that parts of the industry are in good shape, but I believe that no one with even a passing acquaintance with the British film industry as a whole could conceivably argue that at present it is in a satisfactory state. Even the brief upturn registered last year from the all-time low point of 1982 —only 27 films were produced in that year—is so small and temporary at this stage, and so much threatened by what we know of future developments, that it is impossible to place any reliance on the industry's health on that ground.<br><br>
We start, therefore, in the context of an industry that desperately needs an infusion of new ideas, resources and commitment. One problem that it faces—by no means the most important—is that its administration is so fragmented. Despite the Minister's predilections, the public sector is, in various ways, inevitably involved in the industry. Government Departments are involved—to take but two, the hon. Gentleman's own Department and the Department of Education and Science. Bodies of varying status in the public domain—various quangos—are involved. To a newcomer to the industry, it is something of an obstacle course to familiarise one-self with the proliferation of initials representing so many different bodies, all with slightly different functions.<br><br>
In effect there is no one in the industry to pro-vide that unity and cohesion which, for example, the Arts Council—I am by no means a fervent admirer of that council—provides to other art forms. A body is responsible for looking after the future health and resources available to opera, ballet, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
theatre, and so on. That is missing from the British film industry. It is not simply a matter of administration, although that is vitally important, but of recognising the industry's cultural importance. What is missing is someone to take a view about what matters about the British film industry and its value to the country.<br><br>
The problem arises because a distinction is often drawn between film as industry and film as art. That distinction matters. It is no reflection on the Minister and his Department to say that to regard the film industry as simply an industry is to recognise only part of the problem. If we persist in allowing the Department of Trade and Industry to take the primary responsibility for the future health of the film industry, we are in grave danger of failing to take into account some of the much more important aspects.<br><br>
The problem is exacerbated because of the current climate in the Government and the Department of Trade and Industry—the Government are more likely to see such matters in terms of financial, industrial and commercial policy rather than cultural significance. As the Minister is a member of a Government who increasingly say that many of the difficulties facing industry in general can be resolved by competition and by opening up market forces, it is perhaps little wonder that he is likely to get things wrong when examining the film industry and trying to apply those principles to it in isolation.<br><br>
As a consequence of those considerations, over recent years many have recognised the unsatisfactory nature of the current administration of the industry. Many have argued for a unified authority or ad-ministration. By no means has there been unanimity of view on that, but it is possible to point to those who have argued, for example, for a unified Government Department—under a Minister responsible for the arts and cultural heritage—to deal with the film industry, among other considerations. That view was reached by the 1982 Select Committee. I am sorry to say—I believe that I am right—that that report has never been debated. The Minister was not responsible, but the fact that such an important recommendation has never been debated in the House is perhaps a reflection of the importance currently attached to such issues.<br><br>
The Select Committee argued for a " unified Minister for the Arts. That view is heartily endorsed by the Labour party. We argue strongly for a " unified " Minister responsible for the arts to deal will all such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Gentleman's ideal may be a "unified" Minister for the arts, is not there the possibility of a compromise on the issue, which is even more important—that is, combining responsibility for broadcasting and films—if we cannot achieve the major objective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As always, I am alert and sensitive to indications from the Government Benches that they may at least be moving to some extent towards our objectives. In that sense, I am happy to agree with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should make it clear that I was a member of the Select Committee which reported unanimously.</span></p>
<p>12.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Excellent. That gives me even greater encouragement. For the purposes of this debate, it is not my intention to argue for the recommendation of the Select Committee for a Minister for the Arts.<br><br>
We are arguing for a lesser solution that fits more easily into the framework of the Bill. We want a British film authority. However, that would not exclude the idea of a Minister for the Arts—both could be run in parallel. There is no reason why a Minister for the Arts could not have under him a fully constituted British film authority.<br><br>
The case for a British film authority is that by amalgamating the work of Government Departments and supplanting the wide range of quangos involved, it could provide that degree of administrative efficiency and unity which so far the industry has lacked. That would benefit the industry.<br><br>
However, more importantly, a British film authority would provide a focal point for those interested in the future of the industry. They could come together to discuss matters relevant to the film industry and provide the drive and commitment that we shall never get from the Department of Trade and Industry.<br><br>
It is no reflection on the competence of civil servants, particularly those in this room, to suggest that they cannot bring to this industry the long-term expertise and commitment—one might almost say loving care—that it needs. It is vital that some such body should be perceived to be, by those in and outside the industry, the body responsible, which has within its purview the future of the industry.<br><br>
I am not advancing this argument alone. I am supported by my hon. Friends on the Committee—[HON. MEMBERS: " Hear, hear."]. The argument for a British film authority has been supported for a considerable time by other bodies in the industry. The ACCT is on record in support of a British film authority and it details how the authority would work. I shall quote one paragraph from a statement it made:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that this body, under an independent head should have as wide a representation as possible, comprising workers, management, and owners from all areas of the film industry; production, distribution and exhibition. There should also be representatives of the consumers' interest. It should represent all aspects of the British film industry, both in the commercial and cultural sectors, and should have direct access to the appropriate government departments where it would be able effectively and authoritatively to argue for the whole of our industry's interests."</p></blockquote>
That is an admirable summary of the role that we foresee for the British film authority.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister is aware that not only the trade union endorsed the idea, but the Interim Action Committee, set up under the chairmanship of Lord Wilson, also devoted itself to the idea in its first report. That Committee put forward an exteremely deailed blueprint about how a British
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
film authority would operate. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with that report. I have a copy here; it is an admirable piece of work that sets out in detail the constitution, powers, functions and so on of such an authority. If the Minister were tempted to take up the idea—from a body set up by his predecessors—he would have a ready-established blueprint on which to work.<br><br>
Interestingly enough, there are people from well outside the normal purview of trade unions and public bodies who have endorsed the idea. The hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) will recall that in the evidence submitted to the Select Committee, of which he was a member, one of the major figures in Goldcrest argued strongly for a British film authority. The Secretary of State in Standing Committee on the Films Bill 1980 did not reject the idea. In some senses, he gave it a friendly welcome. He was challenged by Mr. Clinton Davis, the then Opposition spokesman, because the Secretary of State had put the idea into deep freeze. The Secretary of State reposed that he had merely chilled it lightly. Being chilled lightly by the Secretary of State is equivalent to being deep frozen by other people. However, it showed the Government's open mindedness and it would be regrettable if that were extinguished.<br><br>
I am encouraged in thinking that the Minister's mind is not entirely closed on the idea. The White Paper, while not going so far as a British films authority, says that:
<br><blockquote><p>" There is no doubt that the film industry feels there is a significant advantage in an advisory body, but would like it to have a wider remit than the Cinematograph Films Council and broader representation than the Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry. We propose to seek the abolition of the Cinematograph Films Council. There is, however, a clear need for a broadly based consultative body for this industry and we see the nucleus of this as being the Interim Action Committee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Wilson."</p></blockquote>
It is a slightly convoluted situation when the Minister and the Government appear to be recognising the need for a more widely based and centrally placed authority for the film industry. They see the Interim Action Committee as the foundation for that authority and therefore turn to it for help, and yet the Interim Action Committee has already said that it would like to be supplanted by a British film authority. I hope that the sequence of such an argument will commend itself to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite a few of us may have listened sympathetically to the trend of the hon. Gentleman's argument. If his argument for that authority were not successful, would he consider the proposal on page 5 of the Bill? Subsection (3) might provide a nucleus for his suggestion if the Minister were prepared to expand it slightly. Subsection (3) says that:
<br><blockquote><p>" The Secretary of State may appoint a person to make recommendations ".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps one person is not enough. Perhaps the Minister would be flexible and increase that number. If the hon. Gentleman were to abandon his idea of an authority, would he accept my suggestion?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be reluctant to abandon hope of securing the hon. Gentleman's support for the notion of a British film authority. I hope that what I have to say will persuade him and his hon. Friends to lend us that support. The hon. Gentleman is right in that if we fail to carry the Committee with us in our amendment, we shall not regard it as the end of the matter. We shall consider any other way of achieving a similar objective. I do not wish to transgress beyond the confines of this debate, but I believe that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) perhaps gives us a foretaste of future debates on what will take the place of the National Film Finance Corporation and fulfil some of its purposes. While I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give us his support on this issue, I think that we can look forward to his taking similar views on some amendments yet to be debated.<br><br>
I freely confess that the new British film authority has been set out in a rather rudimentary form in the new clause, but such a body could be extremely valuable and effective provided that it could operate in the context which the Government, unfortunately, show little sign of establishing. It could do an extremely useful job in promoting British film if there were a will to provide it or the industry with finance, a commitment by the Government, or recognition by them of the need to involve the public sector in this work. So long as the Government turn their face against any comparable public body in saying that the industry is to be dealt with entirely by commercial companies, operating commercially, in the light of market forces and so on, a British film authority would have a limited role; it would be purely advisory, as the White Paper states.<br><br>
If there was established a context in which a major source of revenue was made available to the British film industry and there was recognition of the principle that it was important that Government should commit their support to the industry, the case for a British film authority would be overwhelming. It would then become a body able to provide unified administration of the moneys available, supervise and unify the work of bodies that remained in existence and eliminate from the purview of the relevant Government Departments some of the undoubtedly difficult and messy practical matters that a body devoted entirely to the industry would happily take on. That could come about in line with new clause 5. Under paragraph (d) of the new clause there would also be an important role for the authority in monitoring progress towards the freeing of the market, to which the Minister says he is attached.<br><br>
We are disappointed at the response to the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the industry. We see no sign whatever that the powerful and entrenched positions held especially by major exhibitors which are criticised in the report, will be unfrozen, released or made in any way more liberal. The Government have yet to take effective action to implement the report. That would therefore be another major function of a British film authority —to monitor progress and keep badgering until
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
something was done to free the industry from mono-poly pressures.<br><br>
For all those reasons, there is a powerful case for a British film authority. The Minister's reply will provide a test of the Government's seriousness in recognising a future for the British film industry and providing for it.<br><br>
I conclude by citing in aid another quango active in the industry—the British Film Institute—which has said that it would welcome the establishment of such an authority because it thinks that in that way the cultural worth and significance of the industry would be given proper recognition. For reasons of administrative efficiency, and especially because of the need for a real commitment to the future of the industry and its cultural value, I recommend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened closely to the speech of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). I hope that I did not raise false hope in him when I intervened briefly and said that I might support the formation of a British film authority. The unanimous report of the Select Committee which considered the setting up of an authority stated after considering all the evidence that it did not see the need for a British films authority. I have looked again at the evidence of Mr. Lee and considered the other representations of those in favour of an authority. I also noted the varied evidence on the film section of our inquiry from the independents, so to speak—from Mr. John and Mr. Roy Boulting, who have appeared before us as one, as they always are, Mr. Timothy Burrill, Mr. Benny Fisz, Mr. Steve Kenis, Mr. Christopher Miles and Mr. Alan Sapper of ACTT.<br><br>
I shall not detain the Committee by quoting the evidence. However, in the inquiry we exposed the fact that the British film industry, insofar as it exists, is made up of the most disparate bodies and individuals imaginable. The question is not simply one of the British Film Institute or of Rank or Thorn EMI. The real strength of the industry lies with the independent producers and directors who are the creative thrust and who, if possible, wish to be beholden to no one. Therefore, they create a some-what disorganised impression that the Government wish to organise and make smooth. It would be difficult, or impossible, for an authority to harness those forces. Those forces would be inhibited because the purpose of an authority or quango is to regulate. The Cable Authority exists to regulate with a light touch. The Independent Broadcasting Authority exists to, regulate with perhaps a rather heavier touch.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) sug-gested that a British film authority would be an enlightened and necessary talking shop to assess and give advice. That is not the job of an authority.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he sees no role for a body to take on some of the public functions that are currently exercised by a whole range of quangos? If so, he should make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
that clear. However, if he is saying that there is a range of functions to be taken on in this area, does not he accept the argument that a British film authority would lead to fewer quangos, not more?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brinton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was proceeding towards that point.<br><br>
There is need for centralised thought in terms of policy. I said on Second Reading that it is fundamental to consider general policy for the British film industry in concert with and not separate from general policy for television and broadcasting. The handicap—the Breecher's brook—is that films are the responsibility partly of the Department of Trade and Industry and partly of the Department of Education and Science, whereas broadcasting comes under the Home Office. Our discussions are slightly irrelevant because they do not cover the future of broadcasting. I wish that we could combine the ministerial responsibility in some way.<br><br>
The Government should formulate policy but the industry should set up advice councils. Whatever they are called, they must not be called authorities because that would kill stone dead the creativity of the British film industry. " Authority " is the trigger word that would send every independent creative technician rushing away from this country to work elsewhere. The virtue of the film made for cinema is that at one end is the creative individual who is somehow harnessed by the high-risk investor. In the middle are James Lee, Ken Maidment and other people who try to pull the industry together to make a commercial and artistic entity.<br><br>
I plead with my hon. Friend the Minister not to flirt with a quango called an authority. That would be the end of the British film industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like first to take up some of the points made by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) and during the valuable intervention of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst).<br><br>
The point made by the hon. Member for Hendon, North relates to a later clause in the Bill but is relevant to the amendment and new clause. Clause 4(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>" The Secretary of State may appoint a person to make recommendations."</p></blockquote>
The clause refers to "a person". There is of course a distinct limit to one person's ability to advise and recommend. That is the only function set out for the person to be appointed. The important point is that it relates back to subsection (1) (b) which states:
<br><blockquote><p>" preliminary work to be undertaken or steps taken, with a view to the production of relevant films."</p></blockquote>
The crucial point is that that later part of the Bill and the powers that it gives to the Secretary of State to appoint a consultative person or, conceivably, a consultative body, relate only to the production of films and not to any other aspects of the industry.<br><br>
In tabling the amendment and supporting the principle of a British film authority, we seek to create a wider interest in all aspects of the industry, not only production, although that is crucially
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
important. Partly because we consider that the power given to the Secretary of State later in the Bill is inadequate, we have made a wider proposal at this stage.<br><br>
I should like to refer to the arguments of the hon. Member for Gravesham. I am not necessarily wedded for all time to the title "British Film Authority". It is creates the wrong impression in his or anyone else's mind, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) would be delighted to consider amending it. I believe that that approach to the title of the body reveals a misunderstanding by the hon. Member for Gravesham in respect of the precise nature of the functions to be performed by that body. He seemed to think that the title suggested a regulatory power and that the industry, its technicians and aspiring producers would feel somehow beholden to the decisions made by it. That is far from our minds. If we look carefully at the way in which the new clause is set out and what it seeks to do in establishing such an authority, the point becomes clearer.<br><br>
I wish to speak about the possible functions of such a body. First, we seek to create a body that will bring together all the different interests relating to the film industry. The hon. Member for Grave-sham was correct when he spoke of the industry being full of disparate bodies and individuals, the proliferation of different bodies and interests, and the way in which some aspects of the industry are involved in production and others in distribution. The interests of consumers are largely unrepresented at the moment.<br><br>
Surely it would be useful and sensible to bring together into one body the range of interests involved in the industry, so that they could interplay with each other and speak in a united voice for the interests of British films. Different functions are involved in the process of producing and showing films and there is a necessary dichotomy, which we shall face throught our discussions on the Bill—we face it whenever we consider anything related to the film industry—that film is both an artistic and a commercial product. That difficult relationship between art and commerce lies at the heart of our approach, on both sides of the Committee, to the future success of British film. We shall return again and again to that balance between the needs of art and the workings of commerce.<br><br>
The establishment of a British film authority, or similar body with a similar or dissimilar name, could begin to provide some synthesis to the dichotomy that exists at the moment between the artistic and commercial needs of the film industry.<br><br>
The first general point that must be made about such an authority is that it can be a unifying influence and bring together the different interests, both artistic and commercial, that exist in the industry. Secondly, it can bring those interests together and speak with a unified voice, on behalf of the film industry, to the public and to Government. The voices that are speaking from different parts of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
industry now are not putting forward the best possible case because they are so disparate. It is clear that a strong case should be put forward, especially to Government, because of the myriad of decisions that they must take that will affect the film industry.<br><br>
Thirdly, it is important that the body that is involved in the promotion of film production and the creation and nurturing of new talent should have a role in respect of film distribution. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham has framed the new clause—he said, perhaps too modestly, that it was in. a rough and ready form and in technical terms that may be true—so that it sets out clearly the basic principles of operation of such a body. Within the new clause, under subsection (2) paragraphs (c) and (d), an important link is made between the role of administering arrangements for the promotion of British films -and cinemas—those two are necessarily linked—and the monitoring of the distribution and exhibition of films in cinemas. Time and again, our discussions return to the problems of the stranglehold over the great majority of distribution outlets by two companies.<br><br>
As long as that continues and as long as the independent cinema outlets are so few in number—albeit high in quality—surely we should be con-cerned with how films are shown, how many cinemas are operating, and what sorts of films are being given public viewing. Surely, therefore, it is important for a monitoring role to be undertaken and surely the body that exists to promote and nurture the production of films is the sensible choice to entrust with the job of overseeing what actually happens at the distribution end. If any subsequent decisions are required under the Government's industrial powers, then it is up to them to absorb that information and take action.<br><br>
12.45 pm.<br><br>
In proposing a British film authority, my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham put forward a very valuable suggestion for not merely promoting the idustry but monitoring it, for there are parts of the industry other than production which it is important to monitor.<br><br>
The analogy that my hon. Friend made when pro-posing the new clause and amendment was that of the Arts Council, which is, perhaps the most apt that can be used. When the hon. Member for Gravesham spoke, he appeared to be under the impression that instead of a body that was to foster and nuture new talent and new productions, the Opposition were intent on establishing a body to oppose and inhibit new talent and inventiveness. Quite the reverse. Of course, the Arts Council has its faults but, on the whole, its record in nuturing the arts, in terms of both production and distribution, is a good one. The enabling role that it performs is exactly the same as the role that we envisage a British film authority performing for British film.<br><br>
Straying from the arts, the other example that I bring to the Minister's attention for consideration is the analogy of the Housing Corporation and its role in both nurturing and fostering the work of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
housing associations and in regulating their work. Those involved in the housing association movement do not view the corporation as a dead hand inhibiting their work, but rather as a body that creates an atmosphere in which they can produce and create the houses that they are in business to build.<br><br>
I hope that the analogy of the Arts Council and the Housing Corporation of performing an enabling role rather than an inhibiting and regulatory role will induce the Government to consider the proposal so ably put forward by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next hon. Member to speak, may I request that the Committee does not discuss clause 4(3) now. The very limited bearing that it could have on the question at present before the Committee has now been fully exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had forgotten about clause 4(3), because I do not like the word " authority "—I never have done—and I take issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) on the point, even though I put my name to the amendment, I wish that the word had not been used, be-cause I think that it gives the wrong impression. It is a dangerous word in that respect.<br><br>
With the abolition of the Cinematograph Films Council—I understand the reasons for it—a number of useful functions will, as it were, go into limbo. Those functions will need to be picked up, and how they are picked up is at the heart of this debate. I do not intend to explore clause 4, to which we shall come in due course. However, with-in the context of new clause 5, a number of areas need to be built back into the Bill. For example, there needs to, be a monitoring of distribution. There also needs to be some way in which the performance of the National Film Finance Corporation is monitored. After all, a considerable sum of money is involved. I made a note while my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was speaking, because there is a relation-ship between production and exhibition, and unless the product is exhibited, there will be no production.<br><br>
That brings me back to subsection (2)(d) of new clause 5, because it will show whether the strangle-hold on the industry is being eased, as was suggested in the recommendations of the 1983 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. Moreover, we need to encourage people in the cinema world to come forward, and that encouragement should come from some body. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury had a point when he spoke of the analogy with the Arts Council. I do not intend to discuss the Arts Council in depth now, Mr. Crowther, because you would rule me out of order, and in any case, although it would no doubt be an interesting sidestep debate, it would take us no further with the Bill. However, the concept of encouragement is one that should perhaps be built somewhere into this legislation.<br><br>
If it appears that my support for new clause 5 is a little lukewarm, it is because I see one or two technical problems in the drafting, about which I am not too happy. I say that quite openly, and no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
doubt my hon. Friend will accept the spirit in which I say it. Some of these points should be picked up at some stage, and I hope that when the Minister replies to this short debate he will bear in mind the fact that some of the contents of new clause 5 merit further consideration, if not under new clause 5 perhaps in some other .part of the Bill. As the Bill is now drafted, I have considerable worry that the monitoring that is so necessary will not be performed, and that the encouragement mentioned in the new clause will not take place.<br><br>
I, too, recognise the dilemma that the Government have got themselves into—I mean that in the kindest possible way—whereby cable and broadcasting are with the Home Office, and film and film production with the Department of Trade and Industry. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) drew our attention very early on to the fact that we must clearly understand the distinction between films for the cinema and films for television. I accept that unreservedly, but do the Government have to go to the length of having the two in different Departments? In my view, cable and broadcasting should be given back to the Department of Trade and Industry. I said so when the Cable and Broadcasting Bill was going through the House, and I say it again here today. It would help the industry overall if it had one Minister and one Department. However, that matter is outside the scope of the amendment, but it is one reason why I show some reluctance about the amendment. I support the spirit and principles of the amendment, but not its wording, and I hope the Minister will take note of what we have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the proposition that has been put forward and, indeed, the amendment, there is a slight danger of having to monitor the monitors and having a super-quango to co-ordinate those who are co-ordinating.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury (Mr. Smith) made an eloquent speech—lots of good words: synthesis, strong united voice, pulling together, greater co-ordination, speaking together. But I was not persuaded by the substance of his argument, much as I admired his language.<br><br>
There is a difference between a British film authority with executive and regulatory powers and a committee or advisory body representing the film, television or video industries or the whole lot together—the amendment jumbles them up. The amendment assumes a strong supervisory role for the authority while the Bill seeks to reduce supervisory and regulatory powers of Government. It combines the regulatory function with industrial sponsorship and also cultural responsibility. It combines advisory and executive responsibilities. It wants to continue business done by the Cinematograph Films Council although the CFC has had a statutory duty to advise on the distribution of the levy. The levy is going, so the position of the CFC has to be reconsidered. It suggests that a rescued NFFC should be supervised, but that is not an attractive idea. There are all sorts of arguments about whether the NFFC has enough resources for what it ought to do. However,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
if we set up such a Government body, it is not necessary to have another body supervising it. On the cultural side, the body would interpose itself between the Secretary of State, the British Film Institute and the National Film School.<br><br>
There may be arguments about how the responsibility for films is divided up in Whitehall—the Select Committee has had things to say about that. However, that is a different matter from creating a super, giant megaquango, which is what is being advised here.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) that there is a need for an advisory body. We have said so, and we have also said—I believe this has been accepted by the industry—that it ought to have a wider remit than the CFC. It ought to embrace exhibitors, television and video. We believe that it should be a non-statutory body. We are at the moment consulting about that body, which would emerge from the industry. However, the industry itself has quite a lot to do to sort itself out. I hope that the CFC and the Interim Action Committee are talking to each other about their ideas for the new body. We need an advisory body for this varied, diversified industry, and Government do need a voice.<br><br>
What the hon. Member for St. Helens, South suggested could be achieved far more simply by what I have described. We want to build on the IAC, and we are consulting about that. Indeed, in two minutes' time I hope to lunch with Lady Falkender to hear her views on this great subject. —[Hon. Members: "Oh."] After that sudden revelation to the Committee, Mr. Crowther, I should like to say that I believe that we already have quite enough quangos in this fragmented industry—it is littered with quangos and we need simplification, not a superquango. I therefore advise my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gould</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several points have been made about the amendment. The hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) expressed some resistance, which was echoed by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), to the word "authority". I am not wedded to the notion of an authority, or to that particular label. It appears in the new clause simply because it is the rubric under which this idea has been traditionally discussed over a period of years. However, if the Minister or, indeed, any other member of the Committee would prefer to call this body a council, an institute or any of the other names that have an honourable history in the industry, I am perfectly happy to accept that. We should be foolish and mistaken to be too preoccupied or mesmerised by this particular label.<br><br>
