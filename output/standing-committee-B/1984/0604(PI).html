RELIEF FOR INTEREST</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Moore)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 34, line 22, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) In paragraph 14(2) of the said Schedule 7 (power by order to. prescribe qualifying lenders for the purposes of the deduction scheme) for the words from 'with effect' onwards there shall be substituted 'with effect from such date as may be so specified'.".</p></blockquote>
It may be helpful to the Committee if I start by saying something about the clause itself as well as the Government amendment.<br><br>
The clause itself does two things. First, it fixes the mortgage interest relief limit for 1985-86 at £30,000. Under the 1974 legislation, the limit is fixed for only one year at a time, so that the House has the opportunity to review it annually. As in previous years, we have considered the limit carefully along with other competing claims for further tax relief. The limit was raised from £25,000 to £30,000 two years ago, and we decided that it should remain unchanged this year. At £30,000, the limit is still sufficient to cover the great majority of borrowers. But we will of course be keeping the limit under review from year to year in framing the Budget.<br><br>
Secondly, the clause requires MIRAS lenders to bring new loans above the £30,000 limit into the scheme from April 1987. Loans above the limit are slightly more complicated to handle under MIRAS because only part of the interest qualifies for relief. So, when the scheme was introduced, lenders were given an option to bring these loans into the scheme but were not required to do so. Now that the scheme has settled down, it should be easier for lenders, given suitable notice, to start bringing these loans into the scheme. This will be simpler for borrowers than getting relief through PAYE, and will mean administrative savings for the Revenue.<br><br>
The amendment makes a minor change in the arrangements for bringing new lenders into the MIRAS scheme. The aim is to make the arrangements work more flexibly. At present, those new lenders who have to be prescribed by Treasury order can enter the scheme only from the following 6 April. In many cases, that is convenient because,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
where existing loans are receiving relief through PAYE instead of through MIRAS, it is simpler to let relief continue under PAYE until the end of the current tax year. But in some cases the 6 April rule is now proving inflexible. For example, it prevents a newly prescribed lender starting to bring new loans into the scheme before the next 6 April. It also means that if, for example, a banking group is reorganised and the mortgage lending is transferred to a different company in the group, the new company will have to wait until 6 April before coming into MIRAS. By allowing greater flexibility over starting dates, the amendment should be helpful to the lenders and their borrowers, and I hope that the Committee will agree that it is a useful change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Oonagh McDonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition obviously have no objection to the MIRAS scheme being made easier to operate for all lenders, including new lenders, in the course of the financial year. It is an efficient method of collecting taxation and allows the borrower to know exactly how much has to be paid during the year.<br><br>
I wish to reemphasise the Opposition's attitude to tax relief on mortgage interest and its ceiling of £30,000. The Financial Secretary said that that level was still sufficient to cover most new borrowers as well as existing borrowers. That is just about right. We do not have full information on house prices for this financial year, but they are rising sharply in the GLC area and in the south east and show an increase of about 17 per cent. In other parts of the country, house prices are not rising so rapidly.<br><br>
First mortgages in the GLC area are barely covered by the £30,000 ceiling. Average first mortgages in the fourth quarter of 1984 in the GLC area were £27,468. In the south east, they were a little lower at £24,518.<br><br>
Average house prices are, of course, higher than that. The overall average price of a house in London is £42,000; in the outer south east areas, £39,430; and in the outer metropolitan areas, £48,650. Those figures relate to the first quarter of 1985.<br><br>
We should break those figures down further be- cause an overall tends to be misleading as more expensive houses are introduced in those figures to give an average. I have taken the following figures from the Halifax house price index and looked at particular types of property in London and the counties around London. The price of a semi-detached three-bedroomed house ranges from £33,761 in Bedfordshire, £49,760 in Greater London and £36,597 in Essex. Those average prices are rather expensive, and the average level of mortgage which must be given to first-time buyers is high. Therefore, although the figure is suitable for this year, I hope the Government will keep a firm eye on what is happening to house prices since it may need to be raised in the future to adequately represent the changes taking place.<br><br>
The reason why the Opposition do not oppose either the existence of such mortgage tax relief or its present limit is that they realise what is happening to house prices and the mortgages people need
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
to take out if they are to house themselves. We recognise, too, the enormous burden, even with tax relief, that that imposes.<br><br>
I know that the Government have from time to time expressed surprise that the Labour party states again and again quite firmly its support of mortgage tax relief at this level, but that is part of the Labour party's view of home ownership. That is a long-standing view, because the Labour party introduced the option mortgage scheme to help first-time buyers who were not in those days viewed kindly by building societies and who were not likely to be granted a mortgage.<br><br>
Later, in the 1970s, when interest rates were high —although not as high as they are now—and when the flow of funds from building societies was apt to be interrupted, we also introduced a mortgage stabilisation fund to ensure a regular flow of funds to enable people to buy their own homes.<br><br>
Therefore, the view that I am expressing on the existence of this clause is simply part of the Labour party's history. Our only criticism of the Government's attitude at the moment is, first, that house prices are rising rapidly, and that that rise is due to the collapse not only in public housing but in private house building, too, that has taken place under the Government. It is relevant to consider the numbers of house building starts over the past decade or so. I shall not mention the figures for every year, but shall cite a selection of them. In 1979, for example, there were 144,000 private house building starts. In 1980, there were 98,000. In 1981, there were 115,000. Since then, the number of private house building starts has increased, but in 1981 house building, both public and private, fell to its lowest level since the 1920s. Since then, public sector house building has remained almost unchanged, while private house building has shown only a modest recovery and is now beginning to fall again.<br><br>
Pressure on the supply of private housing has therefore been increasing since 1979. Many of those who would previously have looked to the council housing sector have now had to look to the private sector. The increased demand, unsatisfied by increased house building, has meant that house prices have continued to rise and are set to rise sharply during the current financial year.<br><br>
At the same time, the cost of borrowing has reached unprecedented levels. Real interest rates are higher than they have ever been in terms of any relevant comparison. During the Government's period in office, the average level of mortgage interest rates has been 50 per cent. higher than under the Labour Government. People now have to take on high mortgages in order to house themselves, because the choice of renting in the public sector is no longer available to them.<br><br>
Therefore the Opposition could not possibly oppose the continued existence of mortgage tax relief up to the level of a £30,000 mortgage. We are all too aware of the fact that many young couples have to take on a crippling burden in mortgage repay-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
merits simply in order to provide some sort of home for themselves. That is their only option. They cannot wait for a few years in a council flat or house until they feel ready to take on the financial burden of a small two-bedroomed or three-bedroomed terraced house, often not especially well built or well equipped with room space and facilities. In order to take up that so-called choice, they have to pay vast sums of money each month. Therefore they desperately need every penny of the tax relief offered under the present tax regime.<br><br>
The continuing existence of mortgage tax relief at this level would be only part of the general approach to housing of a future Labour Government. Given that that regime exists and is necessary at the moment, we certainly do not oppose it. We are all too aware of the need of many couples, especially young couples, to receive mortgage tax relief. A future Labour Government would not remove mortgage tax relief for standard rate taxpayers, nor would they reduce the level at which it is currently set—£30,000. To do so would penalise what is now the majority of householders. Home ownership has reached 60 per cent. of a households, and in many parts of the country, including London and the south east, the figure is much higher. We are aware that most households benefit from tax relief.<br><br>
Any reduction in the current level of relief would hit those who happen to live in London and places such as my constituency, where to be housed at all it is necessary to purchase a very expensive—for what it is—three-bedroom semi or terrace house. For many, that is the only living accommodation available. The waiting list for council property in my constituency has more than doubled since 1979, as council house building has virtually ceased there, as it has in many other parts of the country.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
In other words, that is the only option open to young couples. In my opinion, all too often they pay through the nose for properties that are hardly worth the asking price. Indeed, they pay through the nose twice, as interest rates are far higher than they need be, and impose a crippling burden. Therefore the Opposition can see no reason for removing such tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I make a suggestion? Having examined the clause, I felt that it would be convenient for the Minister and the Opposition Front Bench spokesman if I allowed the discussion to go wider than the terms of the amendment. However, it might make for tidiness in the debate if the Committee were to consider deciding on the amendment now. Although I realise that much more may be said on the subject, it might be easier and more appropriate to do that in the clause stand part debate, otherwise subsequent speakers will be limited to the subject of the amendment and perhaps deprived of the opportunity of making other major points. I note that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) wants to speak. Perhaps he will say whether he wishes to follow my advice or would prefer to speak to the amendment in his own way.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of your remarks, Mr. Leadbitter, I shall wait to speak until the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then I take it that my proposal appeals to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have this opportunity firmly to nail the myth put round by Conservative interests about the Labour party's position on the retention of mortgage interest relief; my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) has made that position quite clear.<br><br>
I wish to ask a question which I think may elicit an interesting response from the Minister. To what extent does mortgage interest relief affect interest rates in the market? Some years ago, we heard a great deal about what was called "crowding out". To an extent, the building societies' drive for resources for lending must have an effect on the capital markets. It will be interesting to know whether the Minister thinks that it has a crowding-out effect similar to that in Government Departments when they sell assets to raise money for whatever purpose. That applies in the United States, where Mr. Reagan is being asked to cut his budget deficit. I ask that question not because I wish in any way to indicate dissent on the matter of mortgage relief, but because it might elicit an interesting debate. Those considerations should be taken into account by the Government, who might consider a substantial reduction in interest rate if the relief did not exist. I should like to hear the Minister's view.<br><br>
The relief question gives us an opportunity to weigh up the very different emphasis that the Government place on housing subsidy. Yesterday, we heard about what is effectively a recommendation to end housing benefits, which came in the form of a Green Paper. [Hon. Members: "Come on."] What has been interesting about the last few days is that Conservative Members had to assert themselves in defence of the Secretary of State for Social Services. Whenever Tories do that in the House, it invariably means that they have something to hide. I have learnt over the years that they take that approach on occasions. Whenever they start barking in the Chamber in assertive support, it usually means that they know that they are in difficulties. On this issue they are more than in difficulties, because it, almost exclusively, will cost them the next general election. That is my calculation. I do not think that Conservatives understand the significance of pensions. They cannot interfere with a man's or a woman's pension without taking on the electorate, but yester-day the Government set out their proposals to do precisely that.<br><br>
There has been a switch in emphasis. Some interesting figures show that subsidies to local authorities for council housing, in 1975–76, for example, were £915 million, but that by 1984–85 they had dropped to £393 million—almost one third—while tax relief to the owner-occupied section went up
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
from £1,100 million in 1975–76 to £3,500 million in 19845–85. There was a dramatic increase in rents throughout the country, and, at the same time, a substantial increase in property prices during those years—perhaps fuelled to some extent by the, avail-ability of tax relief. Those are academic questions. Perhaps the Minister will say whether he thinks that there is a link between mortgage interest relief and rising property values.<br><br>
At the same time as the cut in public sector support for housing, there has been a substantial deterioration in the housing policy of local authorities in their attempt to clear slums. There are now 1·25 million houses unfit for human habitation; 1 million houses lack one or more basic amenities and 2·5 million are seriously affected by damp. I should have thought that those were the areas of priority in housing for any Government, but this Government have sought to channel what diminishing resources were available into mortgage interest relief when, if tax relief and moneys available to local authorities were taken together, there should have been a net increase had the Government fulfilled the social responsibilities that they were elected to pursue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stuart Randall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause seems to have two parts to it. The first relates to MIRAS loans and the second to tax relief on mortgage interest.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) has pointed out that in regard to MIRAS, a situation will be created in which lenders, who are not at present required to apply MIRAS arrangements—the basic rate relief at source—to loans about the limit, can elect to do so by giving notice to the Revenue. If my understanding is correct, from 6 April 1987, lenders will be required to apply the MIRAS arrangements to new loans above the limit and give the basic rate relief at source on that part of the loan falling within the limit. That will make the arrangements much more efficient, and I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock on the subject.<br><br>
With regard to the other part of the clause, there should be a regular review of the £30,000 level because of its effect in the south east. Excluding the GLC area, the average house price in the south east is about £38,257, while in Yorkshire and Humberside —my constituency is in that area—the average price is only £22,420. If I were to grind the axe for my constituents, I should say that the figure of £30,000 presented no problems. However, the Labour party must win a lot of seats in the south east and, as good politicians, we recognise that fact. I wonder how people in the south east live, because, excluding the GLC area, the average advance is £24.518 and the average income of borrowers only £12,552. I say "only £12,552" because in the context of the aver-age loan, borrowers in some parts of the south east, especially in Surrey and the stockbroker belt, have a heavy commitment and I wonder how they make ends meet. They must live on faggots and peas.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock has made the position of the Labour party absolutely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
clear on the matter, and I do not need to add to her remarks. They are on the record, and I hope that there will be no more dispute about them.<br><br>
For my constituents, the level is not a problem, but it shows the house price and the north-south difficulties. Demand for houses in the south east is extremely high. There is a shortage of houses and, when there is a shortage, prices escalate. My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock said that in the south east, house prices were rising by 17 per cent. per annum. That is an extraordinary rate of increase when one considers the present rate of inflation. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The rate of growth has not been as high as that in Worcestershire, where I have a property, for the last five years added together.<br><br>
I shall not respond to the taunts of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) about inflation being out of control, although there is much that I could say on that subject. I shall stick to the point and say that in the south east there are serious problems. However, in the north east, north west, Scotland and other less well-off parts of the country, the limit is not a problem at present.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I refer to the housing shortage, because that must be seen in the context of the upper limit of £30,000 on mortgage interest relief. In my constituency, there are about 2,600 houses which are in appalling slum condition, with holes, in the floors and black fungus crawling up the walls. It almost makes me weep when I consider the housing crisis that the Government have created, because it is a most serious problem. Although we have made it quite clear where we stand on the matter of mortgage interest relief, the broader issues of investment in housing and new starts are matters about which I feel very strongly. When people are living in such appalling condtions in 1985, it is an indictment of the sort of society that has been created.<br><br>
It is not merely a matter of not building new houses. In West Hull, which I represent, there are areas which have been cleared ready for new house building but the restrictions on public spending have prevented us from proceeding as we would have wished to overcome the housing problem. However, I repeat that it is not merely a question of new starts; there is a need to renovate properties, especially those built in the earlier part of the century. There area large number of such propertes in my constituency and, as we all know, the cuts in HIP made by the Government mean that we have a problem which seems to be growing. The housing crisis is now of major proportions, yet the irony is that we have total receipts amounting to about £12 billion from the sale of council houses. I find it quite remarkable that we should be in a position where there is £12 billion in the bank while at the same time there is a housing crisis of such great proportions and about 400,000 construction workers on the dole.<br><br>
The position is quite illogical, and it is painful for many people. I am sure that hon. Members who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
represent inner city and the more deprived areas are constantly confronted by constituents who have gone to their local councils to try to get their housing problems solved and, because it is not possible to get a quart out of a pint bottle, they tend to come to their Member of Parliament to ask him or her to take action to overcome their difficulties. Therefore, we know the magnitude of the problem and the frustration that results from the Government's policy of restricting spending. We must view that problem in the context of the tax relief on the upper figures and, in considering the housing crisis, we must examine the public sector as well as the private sector to decide how best to overcome it.<br><br>
I shall not speak at length on the matter and merely wish to support the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee whether the Govemment plan to keep this level under review, bearing in mind the problems of people in the south east of England as house prices continue to rise. At 17 per cent. the price rises will clearly affect people dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Pike <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate my support for the continuation of mortgage tax relief. It is important that the Opposition make that clear. I endorse the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) on this important aspect. We want to nail the lie that the Labour party is opposed to home ownership, as that has never been true and will not be true in future.<br><br>
However, there is an important difference in house prices, and thus the amount required for mortgages, in London and the south-east compared with other parts of the country. House prices in my constituency are some of the lowest in the country, and price increases are small at present. Most people can buy a council house, with the maximum discount if they are living in it, for less than £10,000. Many semidetached council houses in my constituency are selling for about £6,500. When we consider the type of mortgage that people would need to buy a council house at such a figure, it is obvious that anyone who could buy their council house would seize the opportunity under the Government's right-to-buy policy.<br><br>
Certainly I would not oppose anyone in my constituency who wished to do that, as we should consider the requirements of given areas. My constituency has a surplus of housing in both the public and private sectors. About 6 per cent. of council houses and some 5 per cent. of private houses are empty.<br><br>
The Government tend to judge all matters according to what is happening in London, yet in this instance London is not representative. The high prices in the south-east mean that people in that area are dealt with less favourably than people in other parts.<br><br>
The present problem of high interest rates applying for such a long period when inflation is relatively low is unusual. In spite of the recent increases, which are largely Government inspired, inflation is still running at a relatively low figure compared with the figure in recent years.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0680">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
We have high interest rates, but we also have tax relief, whether the mortgage comes from a bank or a building society. That tax relief makes the borrowed money extremely cheap. When I worked in a bank, the bank managers always used to say that one should borrow someone else's money rather than use one's own. If one can get a mortgage and can use one's money to obtain a better income, I cannot blame people for doing so. They can obtain the maximum mortgage, subsidised by mortgage tax relief, quite aside from their individual needs.<br><br>
We now treat people in the public housing sector differently from those in the private sector. As I said earlier, I am not arguing that mortgage tax relief should be abolished, but it is time that the Government considered giving the same concession to people in public sector housing.<br><br>
There is no question that the largest part of rents is often not the cost of building, modernising, maintaining or managing houses. A large part of the burden is interest payments. An analysis of local authority housing accounts would show that interest on loans for various purposes is a substantial part of the burden that has to be passed on in rents to ten-ants.<br><br>
It is time that those in the Treasury and their friends in the Department of the Environment looked at some way of passing on to those who pay rent interest relief on that part of their rent covering interest payments. That would make a significant difference and considerably alter the balance between the private and public sectors, which at present is moving rapidly to the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps a little un-fair of my hon. Friend to suggest to Department of the Environment Ministers and officials that they have friends in the Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pike</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comment. I believe that most Government Departments would say that they were not friends with the Treasury. The Treasury always seems to come out on top. I am sure that, when the social security re-views go through, it will be the Treasury that lays down the figures that the Secretary of State for Social Security was not prepared to give the House yester-day or which the Prime Minister was not prepared to give this afternoon.<br><br>
To give tenants some tax relief on the interest payment element in rent would alter the balance. We should be moving to a system whereby whatever sector of housing people lived in, they were dealt with equally and fairly. That does not happen now under Government policy, and we need to make changes.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) referred to the large reductions in Government subsidy to housing revenue account since the Government came to power. In my borough and many others there is now a nil input into the housing revenue account. In my borough the input was £1.6 million on the last figure fixed by the out-going Labour Government in 1979. There were 8,000 tenancies then, so there has had to be a sig-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
nificant increase in rents just to compensate for that factor, let alone other increases or inflation.<br><br>
Council rents have had to increase tremendously, not only in Burnley but in many councils. They have forced up the costs to those who want to live in rented accommodation, which many people do. The Conservative party claims to be the party of choice. We argue that that choice should ensure that those who want to live in rented houses with-out the problems of home ownership should have the right to live in the rented sector at reasonable costs. They should not be forced to buy their houses merely because of the way that the financial rules and regulations are applied. The Government have changed the system so much during their six years in office that they have forced many people to use the right to buy to purchase their council houses who would not have taken that option if housing revenue accounts had been operated on a fair basis as I suggest.<br><br>
I recognise that because of higher costs in the south east and London areas there should be flexibility. There may be a case for looking at different limits in different areas. Equally, if that suggestion were adopted, it should be applied in all areas of housing.<br><br>
The Government have not taken that possibility into account in their Green Paper on housing improvements. Last week I spoke to an old lady in my constituency who sold her old terraced unmodernised house for £2,500. The cost of improvements to that house in Burnley would be virtually the same as in London. Material costs would be almost identical and labour costs only marginally cheaper.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
No doubt, the person who bought the house would have to spend some money himeslf, and that might involve taking out an additional mortgage. Interest relief would be important as he would not get a loan on the full cost of the repairs. If, as the Government propose, he does not have to pay it back until he sells the house—the White Paper envisages that the cost of the repairs might be 10 per cent.—at the time of sale 10 per cent. will be passed on to the local authority. There will be no interest payment. It is assumed that the price of houses will increase, and that will seen as a form of compensation because the value of the house will when sold be higher than when the improvements were made. In Burnley, the cost of improvements could be more than 100 per cent. of the value —by " cost " I mean the value put in by the grant of a new loan, which could be more than 100 per cent. of the value. In the area which I represent it is possible to spend £10,000 on a house which cost £2,500, and that may increase the house value up to only £7,500, or £10,000 at the most. There would certainly be a shortfall. Who would be pre-pared to improve a house on that basis?<br><br>
There may be a case at some stage for changes to be made so that mortgages reflect difference in values. Perhaps conditions should be made more favourable in the south east so that ordinary people can buy a house. But where the balance is in the

opposite direction—for instance, where the north or other regions are adversely affected—we should move away from centralism and try to deal with the problems of individual areas.<br><br>
I shall not vote against the inclusion of the clause because it is right that mortgage relief should be given, but there is a case for future changes that might produce a balance. We have taken only the example of London and the south east but there are other areas. We should try to take a more flexible approach to meet housing needs in both the private and public sectors. We should endeavour to ensure that people get equal treatment wherever they live.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just been handed the notes of clauses, and I note that. we already passed the amendment to clause 36. I am an avid reader of notes of clauses as they provide the rationale for the Government's intentions. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will ensure that all hon. Members get notes on clauses early enough to be able to read them before debating the clauses. There are amendments—amendments Nos. 171 and 172—to clause 39, and I hope that all hon. Members will study the notes fairly quickly, because we shall reach that stage fairly soon.<br><br>
There is an important point behind my remarks. It is not good enough for the notes on clauses to be put on the Table when we are debating the clauses to which the notes relate. Surely 24 hours would be a minimum; ideally, we need 48 hours to read them.<br><br>
The arguments on clause 36 are well known. Do we retain mortgage interest relief at £30,000 or do we get rid of it? The Prime Minister did not want to abolish it but the Treasury, and perhaps some Treasury Ministers, did. Alternatively, do we increase the limit? No doubt in years past arguments have been advanced in Committee for all of the three options.<br><br>
I believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill, and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike), I shall not vote against it. I believe that housebuyers have a raw deal, especially now because of the amazingly high interest rates. We must not forget that as soon as the Conservative party came into office the mortgage rate soared to 10 per cent. and stayed there from 1979, throughout 1980 and 1981. There was a great deal of talk about interest rates coming down next month and about turning the corner. But the mortgage rate stayed where it was, through 1982 when the blame was probably put on the Americans, and through 1983 and 1984. It is still at a very high level. The Conservative Government are saying that they may be able to bring interest rates down soon, but there are no facts to support that; it is nothing but a pious hope. The real indictment of the Conservative Government's attitude to housebuyers is that they have not pursued policies leading to low interest rates so that people can buy homes without genuine hardship.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
Ministers, the Treasury and Conservative Members were prepared to abolish even the £30,000 mortgage interest relief. The Prime Minister's Conservative instincts may have supported the abolition for the sake of the true free market, but her political instincts told her it would have been political suicide.<br><br>
The time of abolition of the relief may not be long in coming, so I hope that the Conservative party will think of the real hardship suffered by those with mortgages. Those people are paying mortgage rates of about 12·5 per cent. when inflation is running at only 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. Therefore, their mortgage rates are 6 per cent. or 7 per cent. above the rate of inflation. Even with tax relief on the first £30,000, a great deal of money has to be repaid to the building society.<br><br>
As a result of the Government's actions, building societies are now competing with the banks for funds, and the old ethos of providing cheap money so that people can buy their own houses has gone. Building societies are placing more emphasis on attracting investment and on the rates of interest they can offer than on the cost of a mortgage to a house-buyer.<br><br>
That is all very well if everyone is flush with money. In this circumstances, and if people say, "Of course we want mortgages ", the building societies can answer, "We have plenty of money. There is no problem. Our interest rates are competitive and high enough to keep cash flowing in. It will cost you, though—12·5 per cent.".<br><br>
The position is even worse for those living in the south-east, because many building societies add an extra 1½ per cent. on mortgages over £25,000. I do not know the details, but perhaps borrowing over £50,000 involves paying an extra 1 per cent.<br><br>
The Government are penalising to an even greater extent those in the south-east who want mortgages. I am sure that there are people paying 13·5 per cent. or 14 per cent. for their mortgages. I wonder what sort of property £50,000 would buy in the southeast? In some parts of the south that might be just enough for a three-bedroomed semi-detached house. In some areas prices are astronomical, but those living in the wrong part of the country will be penalised by paying what could be called a surcharge on an already high mortgage rate.<br><br>
I should have thought that that would worry Conservative Members and that they would say that it was unsatisfactory and that they were considering what to do about it, yet they have nothing to say. The clause keeps the qualifying maximum at £30,000, and the Government hope that the problem will go away.<br><br>
The problem will not go away. The housing shortage is serious and waiting lists for council housing in my area are lengthening. The problem is made doubly serious because we have the capacity to build houses. I regularly receive information from people in the construction industry referring to under-used capacity which they are prepared to use only if the housing market is there. The market is not there because our economy is so depressed that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
people cannot afford to ask a builder to build them a house and to take out a mortgage, thus contributing to the growth of the economy.<br><br>
Why do not the Government acknowledge the housing shortage? There are no balance of payments difficulties; we can dig up clay and make bricks from locally available materials. There is no need to import oil; everything can be done within these islands and will not upset the Government's financial strategy, as money will be taken out of circulation because people will invest it in building societies.<br><br>
The Government will not do that because they do not believe in interfering in the market. Their peculiar monetarist dogma says that money must be constrained because the money supply must be kept down. That is a pity, because the Government are throwing away the livelihoods of a generation of people—the 20, 30 and 40-year-olds—who could be living much better lives than they have now. The Government do not care one iota about those people. They are throwing them on the scrap heap and forcing them to live in inadequate housing. Some have to live in old housing with fungus on the walls, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, West (Mr. Randall) mentioned. A whole generation of householders who are bringing up families are being thrown on the scrap heap. The Government could help, but they will not.<br><br>
The £30,000 mortgage interest relief has to stay, although I should like it to be increased because it is not enough for anyone buying an ordinary semi-detached residence in the south east.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not my job to explain what the Labour party did before I was elected to the House.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember opposing the pro-vision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There were two Finance Bills in 1983. The provision was contained in the second one which was brought in after the general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it was before I was elected, although it does not actually matter. I have not changed my mind. I should like to see a much fairer system. It means taking a few more minutes of the Committee's time but it is worthwhile to pursue the point.<br><br>
I should like to see a completely different system to enable people to buy houses. Whether mortgage interest relief is £30,000, £25,000 or whatever is very arbitrary. In my area, £30,000 would buy quite a large house: a young couple who are starting a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
family and want to buy a three bedroom semi-detached house would probably only need £20,000. Two years ago prices were somewhat lower.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours </span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why we voted against the provision two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. It is not just a question of inflation. House prices have risen considerably above the rate of inflation in the last two years. How-ever, that does not affect the principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our position was made very clear at the time: in conditions of rising house prices we would reconsider the matter. That is exactly what we have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I certainly do not dissent from that. I shall not duck the point made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Maples). I want everybody who wants to buy their house to be able to do so. I do not want to see what is neessarily a tax concession being available to people to buy houses which are greatly in excess of the requirement of a decent, modern house to live in. For example, if in any part of the country £30,000 could buy a six bedroom detached residence with half an acre, I would be against it. That would be quite wrong and an inexcusable misuse of tax concession. On the other hand, in the south-east of England it is not possible to buy very much for that sum. In some areas £30,000 might buy a one bedroom flat. Therefore £30,000 is clearly not sufficient for a family living in that part of the country. I certainly do not want to ask families to move from one part of the country to another, unlike Conservative Members who have suggested it at regular intervals. There is therefore a case for raising the limit for such people. If there is any doubt about it I would far rather that some families got a little bit of extra help which perhaps they did not need because of the low level of house prices in their area than that other families in other parts of the country were denied that help. I hope that that answers the point made by the hon. Mem-ber for Lewisham, West.<br><br>
A crude £30,000 mortgage interest relief cannot accommodate both extremes. A provision is needed which is capable of fine adjustment to suit the various regions and the levels of house prices in those regions. The mortgage option scheme which the Labour Government introduced was an attempt at that. It is a great pity that we not not have that now. I hope that the hon. Member for Lewisham, West is satisfied.<br><br>
We have an imperfect scheme at present. In some parts of the country the limit could be lowered without any inconvenience, in other parts of the country it ought to be raised. Because I believe that no families should be inconvenienced there is a case for increasing the £30,000 limit. That ought to be looked at to improve the scheme. Unfortunately, however, I doubt whether the Government will do anything, because many of them would like to cut out the mortgage interest relief scheme altogether.</span></p>

I hope that the Minister will consider my remarks. I have tried to outline the principles that I believe should guide any Government's housing policies. We have a desperate housing shortage and our housing stock is getting worse week by week. The Government could do something about that without upsetting their monetarist economic policies. I hope that they will examine the points that have been made and that they will do what they can to get house building started again because that would be welcomed by everyone in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate. First, let me apologise for any difficulty that hon. Members have had in obtaining the notes on clauses. During the six short years in which I have had any responsibility I have always tried to ensure that all hon. Members enjoy the modest benefit to be obtained from the notes. I am advised that the notes on clauses appeared on the Members' notice board at 1 pm yesterday and that those that were not collected were sent by post. 1, too, prefer to receive them in advance, and I shall look into the matter myself to make sure that the system to working.<br><br>
I shall respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) in an important speech, and added to by many of her hon. Friends. I thank the hon. Lady unreservedly for her support, in which she was joined by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall), who recognised not only the benefits of the MIRAS scheme but the additional flexibility provided by our recent amendment. As they said, the scheme benefits both borrower and lender.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thurrock asked me to reiterate my assertion that the limit was still sufficient to cover the great majority of borrowers. The hon. Lady was concerned that in some parts of the country we might be bumping up against the limit. I shall not argue with the hon. Lady's data, but should perhaps put on record that the average building society advance in the United Kingdom as a whole for the fourth quarter of 1984—the latest period for which official figures are available—was £19,000 for first-time buyers and £22,000 for others. As the hon. Lady rightly said, the corresponding figures for the south-east were £23,500 and £25,500 respectively. That means that the great majority of building society advances still fall below the £30,000 limit.<br><br>
However, for new loans, the position is changing. The hon. Lady again reminded us of the situation in the GLC area. Nearly 10 per cent. of all new loans are of more than £30,000 and in the GLC area and the south-east the proportion is almost 20 per cent. The hon. Lady was right to draw the Committee's, attention to that point. As I said earlier—the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West asked me to reiterate this—we shall continue to keep the limit under review in framing the Budget each year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) was back in last year's philosophical mode—a mode in which he often starts legitimate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
discussions in Committee. He made a very fair point. One cannot expect an industry of the size of the building societies industry—which has deposits of roughly £90 billion and lends about £5 billion to £10 billion a year—not to have an impact on interest rates and on the allocation of resources in general. The hon. Gentleman was right to remind us that we are talking about substantial tax reliefs that add to the incentive to acquire property. Indeed, the incentives provided through tax relief stand at about £4.5 billion in 1985–86.<br><br>
Society has clearly made a decision about the validity of home ownership which the Committee seems to endorse, as most hon. Members appear to regard it as beneficial. But that must have an impact on the overall allocation of resources. We are talking about substantial flows of funds—about £5 billion to £10 billion in an overall year. Ultimately, in Committees like this, the politicians must make the judgments. The judgment that we seem to have made is that we should continue support for home relief by allowing clause 36 to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With his knowledge of international finance, does the Minister accept that in countries where there is no mortgage interest relief interest rates are likely to be reduced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moore</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to be drawn into a discussion on that unless we were to hold a detailed debate on particular countries. Obviously, circumstances will change and vary. It is clear from studies by the Wilson committee and others that the quantum of money is not the problem. It must have an impact, but it is based on the choice that we have all made as politicians in the way in which we wish to continue to give relief as we will by endorsing the clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Hirst <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 140, in page 35, line 17, after " enactment ", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or equivalent requirements imposed by a professional body".</p></blockquote>
The amendment stands in my name and in those of my hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) and for Hampshire, East (Mr. Mates).<br><br>
Solicitors and estate agents have been excluded from the composite rate scheme in respect of their general clients' accounts by virtue of their statutory obligation to pay interest to their clients. Accountants also have an obligation to pay interest on the balances on their clients' accounts held in deposit. However, that necessary obligation is imposed not by statute but by the requirements of their professional institutes. The purpose of the amendment is to bring accountants' general client accounts into line with those of solicitors and estate agents.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Ian Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the amendment by explaining the background to the provision that my hon. Friend seeks to amend by extending the treatment of undesignated client accounts beyond estate agents and solicitors.<br><br>
In most professions, when a firm puts clients' money temporarily an deposit the client is still beneficially entitled to the interest, and a deposit would be either inside or outside the composite rate scheme according to whether the client was an individual or a company. But there are special statutory rules governing the holding of clients' money by solicitors under the Solicitors Act 1974 and the corresponding Scottish and Northern Irish legislation, and by estate agents under the Estate Agents Act 1979.<br><br>
When the money is placed in a separate or designated account in the name of a particular client, the client is entitled to the interest, and composite rate will apply in the normal way if the client is an individual. But if the money is placed in an un-designated client account—in other words, a general pool account—the solicitor or estate agent is beneficially entitled to the interest. The rules require him, subject to de minimis exceptions, to pay to the client out of his own pocket a sum equivalent to the interest that the client would have earned if the money had been placed in a separate designated account.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The introduction of composite rate makes the rules for undesignated accounts more difficult to apply satisfactorily for solicitors and estate agents. Most solicitors and estate agents are individuals or in partnerships. Therefore, the interest received by them from the bank would be subject to composite rate, but they could not themselves make payments net of composite rate tax to clients because they are not deposit takers.<br><br>
To put the client in the same position as though his money had been put in a designated account or put directly on deposit in his own name, the solicitor or estate agent would have to make a grossed-up payment according to the client's tax position, which would cost more and would have an unintended side effect on the entitlement of a solicitor or estate agent to retirement annuity relief. Payments to clients could not be netted off against the bank interest but would have to be set off against his business profits. The two would not match. On the other hand, because it was investment income, the composite rate interest received from the bank would not be allowable to form part of his business profits for calculating his entitlement to retirement annuity relief. Therefore, it would be reduced artificially.<br><br>
For those reasons, the Government considered that, as there was a statutory obligation on solicitors and estate agents to operate their undesignated accounts in that way, it would be right to include a provision to take them out for the purpose of the composite rate arrangements. The Government's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
purpose is not to encourage or discourage the use of undesignated accounts generally by professional people—accountants or others. I am sure that many people have had to watch carefully when money has been held for them to ensure that they obtain the correct interest. In that respect, undesignated accounts can cause problems for clients.<br><br>
In no sense do I wish by these provisions to give extra encouragement to the use of undesignated accounts. Indeed, I believe that, where it is possible to use designated accounts, they are better because the position is clearer for the client and for the professional body. Nevertheless, in view of the other statutory obligations on estate agents and solicitors, we felt it right to make the provision. It would not be right to extend the provision indiscriminately and have different treatment so that any professional or other body could make its own rules in such a way as to allow money to be taken from clients without using the composite rate system. I do not wish to speculate on how that might develop, but it could cause deposit-taking activity that would circumvent the normal rules. I would not want that to happen.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) has raised an interesting topic, which has enabled us to explain why the provision is in the clause. I hope that he is satisfied with my explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little anxious about the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Strath-kelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) will answer my questions about it. The amendment seems to intro-duce a requirement for interest to be paid to clients which, as the Economic Secretary said, is not based on statutory requirements but on requirements which can be imposed by a professional body. Although I cannot cite a specific example, I sense that the amendment could open the way to fiddles and create loopholes because general pool accounts or undesignated accounts could be established to collect interest which might be in the interest of the professional body.<br><br>
I have bought only two houses in my life and I cannot remember ever receiving interest from the solicitors on my deposit, presumably invested in an interest-bearing account. I am not sure whether solicitors or estate agents are obliged to give clients that money. Is it discretionary? Perhaps the Minister could assist the hon. Gentleman if he is uncertain. Could the amendment open up various loopholes because the conditions under which money could be collected and thereafter distributed would be at the whim of the professional body? I should prefer it to be a statutory duty rather than it be left to the discretion of a professional body.<br><br>
I am uncertain how much money we are talking about. It seems that the clause seeks to avoid practical difficulties that would arise when payments are made to clients out of interest arising on the general and undesignated accounts of solicitors and estate agents. What are the practical difficulties? Why should accountants be so involved? What
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
benefits will accrue? Will they be purely technical and administrative? As money can be distributed to the client at the discretion of the professional body, who has what? If the accountant, the solicitor or the professional body has one part of the interest and the client has the rest, who will decide the amount to be distributed?<br><br>
Can the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden explain the motive behind the amendment? I do not know whether he has an interest in this matter. He has not declared one. I do not know whether he is an accountant. I assume that the hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment in a totally disinterested and unbiased way. I should like to know the motive so that we can understand why the change, based upon the discretion of professional bodies rather than statutory requirements, is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw to the hon. Gentleman's attention that the reason why estate agents are subject to statutory regulations is that they have failed to put their own house in order. That being so, they are now being put in a privileged position. How are we to justify the fact that estate agents and solicitors will be in a privileged position, because they have failed to put their own house in order and are subject to statutory regulation, while other professional people, who operate satisfactorily through self-regulation, will be in an inferior position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rndall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that comment. The hon. Gentleman said that estate agents and solicitors would be in a privileged position because they had failed to put their house in order. I am not sure what that means. Does he mean that moneys were not distributed or that their tax assessment forms were not filled in? I do not understand. Could the hon. Gentleman say what caused those two bodies to be controlled statutorily? Why is it necessary to deal with accountants in exactly the same way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee but I ought to respond to the hon. Gentleman's last point. I should not have included solicitors in what I said because they have been subjected to statutory control for a long time. I am astonished at the hon. Gentleman's naivety about estate agents and that he was not aware that they were capable of practices which were not always in the interests of their clients. That is why the Estate Agents Act 1979 was introduced. Surely, most moderately well-informed hon. Members are aware of that. It is ironic that now that estate agents are subject to that statutory regulation they are to be in a privileged position and have a more favourable regime than other professional persons.<br><br>
There are further implications because the White Paper on the future of the regulation of financial services makes it clear that one of the guiding principles upon which the Department of Trade and Industry is to draft its legislation is the separation of clients' money from the money of the business. I am sure that every Member of the Committee would endorse that principle. It is entirely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
right. However, I wonder about the position of those bodies because they will be the subject of a statute debated by the House in the next Session. Will they be part of this scheme? That is not clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was astonished at the hon. Gentleman's remarks. He suggested that estate agents are a lower form of life than accountants. I would not want to spend the Committee's time debating that, Mr. Leadbitter, and I am sure that you, as Chairman, would not want me to do so.<br><br>
Frankly, at the end of the day, it all comes down to human nature. If one creates a loophole, it will tend to be exploited if money can be made. I would prefer to deal with the matter by statute rather than create a whimsical, discretionary set of rules as proposed in the amendment. Because there is so much behind the amendment, I would be very reluctant to support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me take this opportunity to reassure the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall) that I have no interest to declare, although I am a professional accountant and it was my interest as such which inspired the amendment.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, since he has come from the business world, is aware that accountants do on occasions hold sums of money on behalf of clients and they are responsible, under the exacting requirements and standards of their profession, to account for any interest which is received from the investment of those funds.<br><br>
The reason why there are no statutory requirements governing the handling of such money is that professional accountants by and large subscribe to high ethical standards and there has been no public demand to govern the way in which they behave. Self-regulation is all very well as long as it can be protected and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said, accountants do have a good track record in this area. My only concern in putting forward the amendment was to bring the position of accountants and similar people of professional standing into the same position as solicitors and estate agents who, under the rules for interest paid and deposits with banks, in clause 37 are in a somewhat privileged position.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary for the explanations he has given and, having aired the matter, I do not want to detain the Committee any further by discussing the matter at greater length. Accordingly, I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make no more than a brief intervention. I listened to the debate with interest and I know that officially the solicitors' house has been put in order, but I wonder if that is really the case. Some solicitors do not do what they should by separating clients money from their own, and that is why one needs statutory provisions to ensure that a grip is kept on them. Perhaps the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Hirst) can give me some examples, but I suspect that when solicitors do not obey the law, a heavy penalty is imposed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
on them, that they are struck off the register and cannot practise as solicitors perhaps sine die or certainly for a number of years. If the hon. Gentleman can inform me, I should be grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentle-man. The amendment has nothing to do with checking up on whether solicitors obey the rules. Like all other professional people who are bound by statute or their professional body, solicitors are subject to exacting standards, and if those standards are broken, they are denied the opportunity of earning their living. That in itself is a very important sanction. I suggest that the debate be restricted to the purpose of the amendment, which is merely to put account-ants, who handle clients' funds and have to account for interest, in the same position as solicitors and estate agents, whose method of accounting for interest in clients' funds is governed by statute and not professional requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that means that the way in which accountants regulate their functions would be subject to statute, I support the hon. Gentleman. But there are various horror stories in some of the complaints to the Law Society about solicitors. One of the most serious and recent complaints involved a member of the council itself, but I do not know whether litigation has arisen from it. I had better not delve into that, but, because there are so many solicitors, here and there something will go wrong. I am not happy that in every case the professional rules of the body concerned are adequate to deal with the transgressions of its members.<br><br>
There are many accountants, and in my two years as a Member of Parliament I have had more than my fair share of constituents complaining about what their accountants have done and asking why their bills are so large, for example, or why their accountants have not taken this or that action.<br><br>
I do not want to give the impression that every accountant is no good and that the profession should be scrapped, but something needs to be done, I do not think that the professional codes of accountants and the oversight which the professional regulating bodies' exercise are sufficient. That is a purely subjective view. I may simply have been unlucky and had a bunch of constituents with problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say how many complaints he has received and how many he has referred to the professional bodies concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I try to sort out problems within my constituency. It may be the habit of Conserva-tive Members simply to pass letters on, but I must have had about two dozen lengthy letters in two years from constituents who were not happy about the activities of accountants. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) may not think two dozen many, but I think that it is a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a massive number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not go so far as to say that it is massive, but it is more than the number of complaints which I have had from constituents about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
solicitors. In two years, I have had about half a dozen letters from constituents concerned about the behaviour of their solicitors, whom they feel have been inactive or have charged too much. My view is purely subjectiv—I would be first to admit it—and not too much should be read into it. On the other hand, there is no substitute for statutory regulation that is clear and undertaken at the will of the people, not at the will of a professional society whose members are involved.<br><br>
I believe that, in instances such as this, statutory provision is superior—although I realise that Conservative Members, by and large, take the opposite view—to voluntary regulation. I am not saying that regulation by professional bodies should be avoided in all circumstances and that there should always be statutory regulation. However, when clients' money is involved statutory provision is preferable. If the amendment were to bring that about, I would support it; if it does not—which seems to be so—I hope that it is not pressed to a division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hirst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask one or two questions about clause 37, which amends schedule 8 to the Finance Act 1984. Its apparent purpose is to allow the Treasury to discriminate between the types of deposit account coming under the regime of composite tax and those excluded from it. Again, there are two additions to the list of those excluded.<br><br>
Last year the Opposition objected to the introduction of the composite rate of tax to be paid on deposits, as it meant that for the first time some non-tax payers with deposits in the bank would pay tax on them, albeit at the lower composite rate of between 24 per cent. and 25 per cent.—although that rate can vary a little from year to year. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) spelt out our objections in detail last year during the Standing Committee debate and I do not want to go over that ground again.<br><br>
However, perhaps the Minister will tell us which sort of deposits are excluded and why the two new types have been added to the list. More important, as some sorts of account may be excluded from the tax, the Minister should tell us why that should not apply to the deposits of non-tax payers.<br><br>
I understand that the deposits in the present list can be defined objectively—that is, not in terms of the amount of tax that would or not be payable but in the context of the type of funds involved. R might be complicated to sort out the deposits of people who would not be liable to pay income tax on those deposits. Nevertheless, as the banks already have to provide an enormous amount of such information for certain types of account to be excluded from the composite rate, we should consider the position of non-tax payers with a small deposit in the bank who became liable to tax when the law was changed last year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
I believe that another sort of account that is excluded is one held by non-United Kingdom residents. The appeal of such accounts in British banks would be greatly reduced if income tax were deducted at source for those people. I assume that the Government have not applied the composite rate to accounts held by non-United Kingdom residents because they wish to ensure that the attractions of British banks continue to equal those of Switzerland for the excess funds of American and European individuals. I assume that the Government wish that regime to continue for United Kingdom residents with such accounts.<br><br>
There are three questions that I should like the Minister to answer. What types of account are excluded, and why? What about the plight of non-taxpayers who suddenly find that they are subject to tax, to be deducted at source at the rate of 24 per cent. or 25 per cent.? Is there no possibility of excluding such accounts from the composite rate, given that many accounts deposited in banks are excluded for other reasons?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to questions about the clause from the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald).<br><br>
The clause tidies up a number of loose ends from the legislation introduced last year. As the hon. Lady reminded us, her hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) and others objected to the composite rate scheme. One objection was that it would mean that non-taxpayers would not be able to recover tax deducted in respect of those deposits. We debated this at length last year, but I will explain again.<br><br>
If we excluded non-taxpayers, there would be no composite rate at all because, by definition, it is a rate which takes into account the tax likely to be paid by the whole body of depositors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not mean that. What happens is that when non-taxpayers are taken into account, the composite rate is lower than the standard rate of tax. If non-taxpayers were excluded, the composite rate would be at the standard rate of tax, or possibly higher, because taxpayers would be taken into account. It would mean a higher average, not that there would not be one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn too far into the mathematics of it, but if non-taxpayers were excluded and tax merely deducted at basic rate, there would be a basic rate tax system, not a composite one, which would be an entirely different basis. Those who pay higher than basic rate do not pay through normal deduction at source; they pay through assessment to income tax, so there would be a 30 per cent. basic rate.<br><br>
To pick up a point that I made last year, I said —but perhaps was not believed in all quarters—that I thought that the introduction of composite rate would have such an effect on the banks that it would not be to the disadvantage of non-taxpayers. That has been so. From having quoted last year rates for gross interest below the net interest rates
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
quoted by building societies, the banks have now moved up to a highly competitive position, so, relative to building society deposits, non-taxpayers are probably no worse off and taxpayers should be better off. I do not wish to repeat a large part of last year's debate. I merely looked it up to see whether that prediction had been borne out, and found that it had.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
More specifically, the hon. Member for Thurrock said quite fairly that, under the clause, it is possible for certain types of deposit to be excluded. The best for certain types of deposit to be excluded. The best way of explaining that is to illustrate what I have in mind.<br><br>
Subsection (2) makes the general powers more flexible because it provides that deposit takers can be brought in from a date other than 6 April. If a new type of deposit taker or body subject to composite rate came into the business half way through a year, they would not have to wait until 6 April the following year, but could be included immediately, for convenience.<br><br>
In the same way, the second power means that when bringing in new deposit takers, the Treasury will be able to exclude particular types of deposit. That route was suggested to us by the case of the local authorities, which will be brought in from 6 April 1986 when there will be an order to provide for the transitional arrangements announced in November 1984. The idea is to exclude from composite rate any local authority bonds and mortgages which were issued before that date. That would protect depositors who had invested in fixed-term bonds for the life of those bonds. Those bonds are a particular category which can, therefore, be excluded from the general application of composite rate to that particular group of deposit takers. We thought that it was sensible to be able to do that in the case of local authorities and possibly in other cases where such technical questions might arise.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thurrock asked also about other specific provisions, one which is to include Scottish partnerships and another which is to exclude Lloyd's premium trust funds. The reasons for those two provisions are specific to the particular cases. As the law stands, deposits which are made by Scottish partnerships are outside the scheme because in Scotland, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, a partnership is a separate legal person whereas in England it is merely the collection of the individual partners. That produces an anomalous result and obviously the scheme should apply to Scottish partnerships in the same way in which it applies to others.<br><br>
The other special case is that of the Lloyd's premium trust funds. These deposits are paid into a fund where they are available to meet claims and liabilities. Often, money is placed on deposit and may earn interest. The individual members of syndicates are entitled to the interest provided that it is not used to settle claims.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0688">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
In general terms, individuals who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom are entitled to interest outside composite rates. In the premium trust funds it is usual for some individuals to be non-residents and some to be residents. The funds frequently contain money which relates to three different years because of Lloyd's three-year accounting sys-tem. Therefore, the membership of trust funds can vary between those years. Until the accounts for a particular underwriting year within the three years have closed and the income allocated between the members, it is not possible to say which should be subject to composite rate and which should not. In a sense, it is a trading and not a corporate operation, in which case it would be outside composite rate, but it has many of the characteristics of a corporate activity. It seemed proper under such circumstances for Lloyd's premium trust fund to be excluded.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's final point was about non-residents. I touched upon that matter in connection with Lloyd's. She is right in saying that it would greatly reduce the attraction of London as a financial centre if it were not able to pay gross interest to non-residents. The hon. Lady pointed to the need to keep British banks competitive and mentioned American and European depositors. Depositors outside the more stable places such as the United States and Europe frequently wish to place their funds in inter-national centres because of political troubles and so on in their own parts of the world. That is why non-resident funds in this country are able to receive gross interest. However, the clause provides that that has to be attested, so no one could merely walk in and say, "I live on the other side of the world, so will you please pay me gross interest?" A person will need to sign a certificate and that will place the responsibility on him in relation to getting the gross interest. It will be possible for the certificate to be provided either by the depositor or by the deposit-taking institution, but without this provision it is clear that many overseas funds would be inclined to move to financial centres other than London.<br><br>
Having discussed the provision with those concerned, I am satisfied that it will protect the interests of the Revenue while, at the same time, it will not inhibit the operation of the City and its international banking. That is why we have included it in the clause.</span></p>

BUILDING SOCIETIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions about the special composite rate arrangement for building societies which will come into force on 1 March 1986, when societies will have to account quarterly for income tax in respect of interest paid to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
investors instead of as at present, when, I believe, it is paid in January for the year in arrears.<br><br>
It will produce a minor cost for building societies in March next year, which, I believe, will amount to £50 million in a full year, spread across all the members of the Building Societies Association. I know that BSA members are not greatly worried about this but a point that occurred to me may not have concerned the Minister. It might affect the even flow of funds available for mortgages in the next financial year, although not in this year. No doubt the Minister will have noted that the building societies have certainly been faced with problems this year. For example, the March and April press releases from the Building Societies Association comment on the decline in building society net receipts in those two months. That decline, of course, has been one reason, but not the only one, why mortgage interest rates remain at their extremely high level. One assumes that that is a matter of concern to the Government as it certainly is one to most of the rest of us.<br><br>
It occurred to me that next year might turn out to be the wrong year in which to alter the arrangements. I believe that it would be quite sensible for the Government and the building societies to re-main in negotiation on this matter so that there is not a sudden dip in funds in any year or an uneven flow of receipts throughout the year because of the payments being made quarterly. I know that that will apply to the first year in which the changes come into operation, and when the system settles down I assume that the building societies will be better able to cope with the quarterly payments. I know that they would prefer the composite rate and quarterly payments to be settled in the longer term. However, considering the flow of net receipts into the building societies this year, the Government should take it on board in 1986, in case the same problems occur then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene. I nearly raised a point of order a minute ago when you moved clause stand part, Mr. Leadbitter. On two occasions I rose to my feet, but you did not call me. I wondered what the reason was. By the time I should have intervened, the motion had al-ready been carried by the Committee.<br><br>
There is a similarity between this clause and the previous clause, and I wonder whether you will permit me some latitude in that I sought to speak on those two occasions. Although we are specifically referring to building societies here, there is an anomaly in regard to bank and composite rates which might have implications for building societies. That is how I relate the matter to the clause.<br><br>
I should like to read part of an article by a Jersey journalist, Mr. Peter Body. It sets out an anxiety and I should like to feel that the Government had filled this loophole. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Concern over local banks advertising new tax dodge. At least one and perhaps several local banks have been threatening the 'low profile' which the Island authorities want Jersey to adopt over a possible new tax dodge for United Kingdom residents. The authorities are worried that advertising the fact that United Kingdom residents
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
can use the Island at least to put off paying some of their tax will harm the Island's image as a reputable finance centre. It might also result in some kind of retaliation by the United Kingdom Inland Revenue. The problem arises over the introduction of a new composite rate of tax on bank deposits in the United Kingdom. As from April 6, interest on bank deposits held by individuals in the United Kingdom will have to have tax deducted at source by the UK banks, much in the same way that building societies "—</p></blockquote>
those precious few words—
<br><blockquote><p>"deduct tax on their accounts.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"But this does not apply to deposits held by Jersey branches of United Kingdom banks or foreign banks in the Island, and there have already been predictions that up to £4 billion in deposits will be moved 'off-shore' from the United Kingdom to such areas as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. But this is the kind of business the Island authorities do not want to encourage."</p></blockquote>
I shall not read on—the Minister can gather what is in the rest of the article. All I want to know is whether we have filled this loophole. I intend to press the Minister to tell us whether we have filled that loophole. If not, it deserves a full-scale debate in Committee, and perhaps on Report on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lead-bitter. I did not rise before because I saw the hon. Gentleman rise earlier and did not want to come in before him. I am happy to respond to what the hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) said, but I wanted to make sure that no other Opposition Member lost an opportunity to speak at an appropriate time.<br><br>
I must commend the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) for his ingenuity in raising this point on this clause. The offshore deposits have never been subject to the composite rate tax. The Jersey journalist quoted by the hon. Gentleman has been indulging in a lot of speculation. Predictions of vast quantities of deposits moving offshore for that purpose are not realistic. I shall look at the hon. Gentleman's point but there was much speculation and journalistic licence in the comments that he put before the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Dr. McDonald) pointed out that part of the change relating to building societies would bring their own interest payments on to a quarterly instead of an annual basis, as they have been up to now. The change is one of the main ingredients in bringing the systems for building societies and banks more closely into line.<br><br>
We have obviously had to consider the cash flow effects on the building societies and on the Government. When the transitional arrangements have been completed the system will be more satisfactory for both. It is not very satisfactory for the private financial sector to have to pay the Government enormous sums all in one go; nor is it satisfactory for the Government to be substantially in deficit with the private sector for some months and substantially in surplus for others.<br><br>
Once-a-year payments of large sums of money—more than £2,000 million for building society interest
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
—are disruptive to both ends of the transaction. Building societies would like to keep the money they owe in tax for as long as possible—that is only human nature—but under the old arrangements they have been able to keep it substantially longer than the banks can. A quarterly basis will bring building societies more closely into line.<br><br>
I cannot predict building society interest rates or cash flows in 1986 but we have deliberately discussed arrangements with the building societies a long time in advance so that they can plan their cash flows. Building societies are, on the whole, prudent bodies and have not used that part of their resources earmarked for tax payments for mortgage lending. They need their own liquidity. As they know that they have a specific liability for tax at a certain time of year they will put money aside for that purpose. The change is unlikely to have any significant influence on the timing of building societies' decisions about the flow of funds for mortgage lending because such matters have been under consideration for a long time.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Member for Thurrock that we have been discussing the plans in great detail with the building societies. We have said that we are willing to introduce transitional arrangements to smooth the effect of introducing quarterly payments. As negotiations are continuing it would not be wise for me to say more about the matter today. However, the negotiations have been conducted in a sensible and straightforward fashion and I have no reason to think that we shall not come up with a system that is satisfactory to the building societies and to the Government. From next year and when the transitional period is concluded, building societies will make more even payments. The change will have a greater effect on some societies than on others, depending on when their year ends fall. That is why there must be some transitional adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, banks and building societies will operate the composite rate of tax in exactly the same way. Is that not part of the Government's wider aim of allowing building societies to operate at least partially like banks?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We recognise the increasing competition between building societies and banks. We hope to introduce legislation to enable building societies somewhat to extend their activities, but at present there is a considerable discrepancy between banks and building societies, in that building societies are able to enjoy possession of funds earmarked for tax for very much longer than banks can. The clause will bring greater equivalence—not an exact equivalence, because we have not chosen the same months, because that would produce further bunching, but broad equivalence between banks and building societies. In return, the building societies will get certain advantages that they have not had up till now. They will be able to pay interest gross to nonresidents, for example. It is all part of the package.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Randall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm the date on which the scheme becomes mandatory? We

appear to have conflicting information on the subject. We have one report that says 6 April 1986, and an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> suggests January. Can the Minister tell us the date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arrangements for paying gross interest will come into operation after 5 April 1986. January is when the annual payments are made at present. Normally, building societies pay their tax in February—it is meant to be in January, but there is a short period of grace so they tend to pay in Feb-ruary—in respect of the financial period ending in that fiscal year. So if a building society ends its financial year at 31 December, in the same Government financial year from April to April, the tax is due in January, but is normally paid in February. That is the same, whether the year end is 31 Dec-ember, 30 June, or whatever. That is the present system. The new scheme will come into effect from the next financial year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unduly awkward over the dates, but the Inland Revenue press release says that arrangements will come into effect on 1 March 1986.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The commencement date is 1 March 1986 for payments only, but the actual quarters will end in each February, May, August and November.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I put the matter to the vote, may I respond to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who with his usual ingenuity stole a march on the Committee's proceedings?

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendment No. 172.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 171 and 172 are pre-consolidation amendments and purely technical. Section 64 of the Friendly Societies Act 1974 relates to the limits on benefits to members of friendly societies and is primarily a tax provision. It would be sensible to consolidate it with other tax pro-visions relating to similar subjects in the forthcoming consolidation of the taxes Acts in 1987. I am advised by parliamentary counsel that this is a good opportunity to allow that consolidation to take place. Amendment No. 171 has no effect of substance at all and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for me to comment in any depth on the amendment. The Opposi

tion are aware that this is a pre-consolidation measure and have no objection to it as such.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 38, line 1, after "1984", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"by a new society, as defined in section 337(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 ".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take amendment No. 147, in page 38, line 1, after " 1st June 1984 ", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"by a society which was registered after 3rd May 1966".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 156 is similar to amendment No. 147, which was tabled by the Op-position. Therefore, my remarks on amendment No. 156 are addressed also to amendment No. 147.<br><br>
I take the opportunity, as this is the first group of amendments to which my remark applies, to say that in a number of cases the Government amendments are similar in purpose to those put forward by the Opposition. They have probably been discussed by the friendly societies liaison committee with Opposition and Conservative Members. We took a little longer to table our amendments than the Op-position because we tried to get the wording right. In most instances the substance of the Government's amendment's in this part of the Bill is the equivalent of that of the Opposition's. That applies to amendments Nos. 156 and 147.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
There is a new provision in clause 39(1) that is designed to stop people doubling up their life and annuity policies to circumvent the limits, but be-cause the provision applies to all friendly society annuity contracts, anyone who took out a bona fide contract before 1 June 1984 with a traditional friendly society could be prevented from taking out an additional policy showing a gross sum. That was not the intention. The friendly societies liaison committee suggested an amendment, and amendment No. 156 differs only slightly in giving the technical definition of a new society rather than the registration date mentioned in the Opposition's amendment.<br><br>
A small point of substance in the difference between the two amendments is that amendment No. 147 does not include societies registered just before 3 May 1966 that had been carrying on single premium life assurance business in the three months before that date. There was some abuse by the newer societies just before the operative date of May 1966, and that is why amendment No. 156 refers to the definition in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 instead of the date in amendment No. 147.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is correct in saying that the same purpose would be achieved by both amendments but in slightly different ways. Perhaps it would be better not to press amendment No. 147 and to accept the Government amendment. The Minister is correct in thinking that the Opposition have been in touch with the friendly societies association and, as he knows from last year's debate, we are anxious that the business quite properly con-ducted by the old friendly societies should not be

inadvertently prevented by an amendment that is designed to prevent abuses practised by some new societies. Our purpose is that the reduction in limit should apply to the annuities issued by the new societies and not to annuities issued quite properly over many years, and not marketed for surrendering, by the old friendly societies. As the Government's amendment will achieve that purpose, I shall not press amendment No. 147.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 172, in page 38, line 23, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Section 64 of the Friendly Societies Act 1974 (as amended by subsection (1) above)—
<ol>
<li>shall have effects as if contained within sections 332 to 336 of the Taxes Act, instead of within the said Act of 1974; and</li>
<li>shall extend to Northern Ireland;and, in consequence of paragraph (b) above, section 55 of the Friendly Societies Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 shall cease to have effect.".—[<i>Mr. Ian Stewart.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 39, line 32, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) With respect to business carried on before 19th March 1985, section 334 of the Taxes Act (conditions for tax exempt business) shall be amended as in (5)(b) and (5)(c) above.".</p></blockquote>
Clause 39 amends the legislation first introduced in the Finance Act 1966. Over recent months, the Inland Revenue has objected to the long-standing practice of back dating policies and policy alteration which it claims is inconsistent with the requirements of section 334 of the Taxes Act When legislation affects office practice—which is what we are concerned with—it is customary for some sort of practice note or explanatory memorandum to be issued to those affected. The files of correspondence between the Inland Revenue and the friendly societies liaison committee show that in 1966 the Inland Revenue took the view that the new legislation affected policy alterations and the issuing of a practice note was suggested. A memorandum was finally issued in December 1966 which made no explicit reference to policy alteration and in the absence of any advice to the contrary the office practices of the societies continue unchanged.<br><br>
Policy alterations are relatively few but the Revenue's objection to backdating policies can affect a considerable part of a society's business. The backdating of policies sounds much worse than it is. Where a member has had a recent birthday which affects the premium rate, it is common practice simply to backdate the policy to give the advantage of the younger age. Obviously only a few weeks or possibly a month is involved. To facilitate the collection of premiums it is a common practice also for renewal dates all to be the same day of the month, and the dating of the policy has to be consistent with that.<br><br>
The system adopted by one society, the Teachers Provident Society, has resulted in 15 per cent. of the policies being backdated, but mainly by a matter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
of a few days. The notion of backdating policies seems at first to be alarming but these are obviously merely minor adjustments which the friendly societies make. The friendly societies would therefore like that well-established practice to apply to pre-Budget day contracts too, because, especially from the point of view of protection of the revenue, backdating reduces the advantages of tax exemption. That is the purpose of the amendment and I look forward to the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Lady on her mastery of the intricacies of friendly society business. The matters we are dealing with are rather technical. However, on the general point about backdating, I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that subsection (5)(b) provides that in future, contracts can be backdated by up to three months. That will, I think, be generally welcomed by the friendly society movement. The provision has been introduced in response to the points that have been made to that effect.<br><br>
There is a serious problem. It has always been wrong to backdate these policies. The practice may have been going on for a long time but the Inland Revenue tells me that it has always objected when it has discovered it. However, what is more serious than the problem of a few policies that have been backdated by a short period is that technically the legal powers of penalty which arise in such cases are draconian because they could cause the society which issued the policy to lose the whole of its tax-exempt status in respect of all the life and endowment business that it had conducted. Accordingly, the friendly societies liaison committee suggested to us that we try to regularise the position.<br><br>
Two of the proposed changes could trigger the draconian penalty of loss of tax-exempt status. The hon. Member for Thurrock mentioned backdated policies, but in theory policies containing a waiver of premium on account of a policyholder's disability could cause the disallowance of the whole of a society's tax exemption.<br><br>
The purpose of the Opposition's amendment is to provide retrospective clearance for backdated policies in respect of contracts made before Budget day, when the changes were announced. We do not consider the amendment necessary, partly because its scope is more limited than what we have in mind. It would clear infringements relating to backdating but not those related to the waiver of premiums because of disability—an equally important consideration.<br><br>
It would be possible to construct amendments technically adequate to deal with all these consequences. However, it is not necessary to do so because friendly society policies containing minor infringements such as those under discussion are very rare, and will, of course, become rarer. We do not need a legislative solution. The Revenue and the liaison committee have discussed the matter, and where trivial infringements come to light they will normally be disregarded. I am advised that the liaison committee has accepted that that is a reasonable solution, and that it will cover the second

problem, which is not dealt with in the amendment. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Thurrock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. McDonald </span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's re-marks and his assurance that minor problems can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
be dealt with in the way that he has outlined, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
