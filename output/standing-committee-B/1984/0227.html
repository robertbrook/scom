REGISTRATION OF PARENTAL VIEWS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 3, line 20, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The Secretary of State may make and may revoke regulations containing provisions about maintaining registers showing those pupils who are not to be exempt from corporal punishment by members of staff for the purpose of section 1 of this Act. In absence of such regulations, no such registers shall be maintained.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: Amendment (a) to the proposed amendment, in line 4, leave out "no such registers shall be maintained" and insert
<br><blockquote><p> "corporal punishment shall be illegal".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>No. 44, in clause 4, page 7, leave out lines 1 to 6 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) The Secretary of State may make and may revoke regulations containing provisions about maintaining registers showing those pupils who are not to be exempt from corporal punishment by members of staff for the purpose of section 48A of this Act. In the absence of such regulations, no such registers shall be maintained.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment (a) to the proposed amendment No. 44 in, line 4, leave out<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"no such registers shall be maintained" and insert "corporal punishment shall be illegal".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my intention that we should make reasonable progress today, and to make the best use of our time it would be useful, if we could conclude our proceedings by 7 o'clock, otherwise we shall have to break until 7.15 pm and then come back for an inconveniently short time. I hope that the Committee will bear that aim in mind.<br><br>
I have agreed with the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) to move his amendment but I hope that he will be present to speak about it shortly.<br><br>
I have mixed feelings about the amendment because on many occasions I have chided the Government about using statutory instruments instead of primary legislation. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science explained to me in another Committee Room the last fortnight that it was reasonable to abolish the Inner London Education Authority by statutory instrument. Therefore, I am not asking much by seeking to include in the Bill the possibility of revoking regulations. I believe that corporal punishment will be rapidly phased out in most of our schools as a result of the Bill. My amendment would enable the Government to revoke the regulations and establish a uniform pattern of no corporal punishment throughout the country.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
Not only will the Bill be so unworkable in practice, that the majority of local authorities, governing bodies and head teachers, will phase it out rapidly, but the Government may well lose again in the European Court of Human Rights. If that happens, this legislation may not prove to be satisfactory in regard to the European court. It might then be convenient for the Minister to have the opportunity through statutory instruments to turn the Bill into a total abolition Bill.<br><br>
I have listened to the Minister on other occasions and know that his main design is to put up a smoke screen to maintain corporal punishment, while he secretly knows that the Bill is close to an abolition Bill. I have no great hopes of persuading him to accept the amendment, but in spite of my reservations about using statutory instruments for major legislation, it would be useful to have in the Bill the power to revoke the regulations and so to make it clear that corporal punishment would be illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clement Freud <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridgeshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being a few minutes late. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) for moving the amendment.<br><br>
I thought that the two amendments—one for England and one for Scotland—would commend themselves to the Minister. We all accept that we are saddled with a rotten and shoddy Bill. The amendment would enable the Secretary of State, at a future date, to abolish corporal punishment without the need for hon. Members to consider another Bill during dreary afternoons in an overheated Committee Room, talking at odds on a subject on which we are united. The power to amend the Bill in line with future decisions in the European Court of Human Rights is not contained in the Bill, but my amendment would put it in, thus introducing a latent but important power. No further legislation would be needed if the Secretary of State decided to abolish corporal punishment in the future. We are united in realising that the more impracticable the Bill becomes, the less likely it is that a large man will ever again be able to hit a small child without wondering whether the law will step in.<br><br>
The amendment would prevent time-wasting and make the Bill more flexible. It would create powers that might have to be used in the event of future rulings. It would be prudent to include it as simple good housekeeping. However, I do not think that the Minster will accept the additional phrase inserted by amendment <i>(a)</i> by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, because it goes too far.<br><br>
It would be a minor but sensible step to make punishment dependent on a register, and to allow such a register if the powers that be judged that to be the best reaction to the court's decsion. Such a move would have no effect on the Bill now, but might save considerable time in the years to come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Mr. Bob Dunn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this short debate, and am grateful for the concern of opposition Members about our welfare and the future business of the House. As the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) has said,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
the amendment would allow a Secretary of State to dispense with regulations. If that happened, registers could not be kept, and abolition would be brought in through the back door, because in the absence of a register pupils within the scope of the legislation would be exempt from corporal punishment. The amendment would therefore enable the Secretary of State to abolish corporal punishment if he decided to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will probably understand why I do not find that as satisfactory as he does. The Government do not intend to enforce abolition, and if any future Administration wished to do so they should use primary legislation rather than the revocation of regulations to achieve their ends. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important group of amendments, designed to clear up some of the doubts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
felt by those outside about the way that the Bill is intended to operate in England and Wales. On Second Reading and in Committee the Minister has made it clear that the Government do not intend to use the Bill to reintroduce corporal punishment in those areas where it has already been abolished by the local authority and the schools. However, it is hard to find where that is stated in the Bill and how the Minister arrives at that.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Minister's argument is that the question whether governing bodies have powers over corporal punishment depends greatly on the rules that were established by the individual local authority for the setting up of governing bodies in its area. It seems to be an area where the law is not as clear as it might be. What are the powers of the local authority? What are the powers of the governing bodies?<br><br>
The Government say that if a local authority has abolished corporal punishment its view can override that of the governing body. The Bill does not give the governing body the right to reintroduce corporal punishment. The Government are saying that the relationship between the local authority and its governing body is not affected by the Bill. Although they accept that the position is slightly unclear and that there have been a few court cases that have not helped to clarify the matter, they contend that the local authority, through the articles of government for the governors, can ensure that corporal punishment is not used in any of its schools. If that is the position, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that it is, I can understand his argument that amendments Nos. 20, 31 and 65 are not absolutely necessary. But it has to spell out very clearly that that is the position.<br><br>
We have to keep at the back of our minds the possibility that the courts may decide that the Department of Education and Science's interpretation of the relationship between local authorities and governors is not the one to which they hold. We also have to bear in mind that the Government issued last year a Green Paper on governing bodies. It dealt with their power and duties as well as their composition. Again, I can accept the Government's argument that it might be better, if we want to define the responsibility of the local authority and of the governing bodies, to do so in future legislation. However, the Government are not really in a position to tell us when they intend either to make an announcement about their decisions on the Green Paper or, if they decide to implement any of that Green Paper, when legislation would be brought forward.<br><br>
Unless the amendments are inserted in the Bill the position will remain slightly unclear. I hope that the Minister can give us absolute assurances that he and his Department believe that the legislation is such that even though it is not written into the face of the Bill, it will be impossible for governors to reintroduce corporal punishment if their local authority has passed a resolution saying that it does not want corporal punishment in any of its schools. I tabled the amendments to probe and to elicit further information from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
briefly if only because I am almost inaudible and I do not want to try the Committee's patience. I am extremely sympathetic to the proposals contained in amendment No. 20. As I understand it, it gives the local education authority the ultimate discretion to prohibit corporal punishment in schools that fall within its area, leaving to the school governors the option of introducing it if the authority decides not to prohibit it. Ultimately, the local education authority has the power to prohibit corporal punishment in schools within its area if amendment No. 20 is carried. That seems a not inappropriate situation.<br><br>
As I understand the law, the local education authority can achieve that result by two rather backdoor ways. For example, it can do it if the articles of the schools in question enable it to make such a directive or if the contracts of employment between the teachers and the authority give it the right to prohibit corporal punishment. Therefore, there are two devices—one at least of which is not intended for that purpose—by which the local education authority can prevent corporal punishment in schools within its area.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I prefer this matter to be dealt with by straightforward statutory provision. On the face of it, it is reasonable and proper that the local education authority, being the locally-elected body, should at least have the power to prohibit corporal punishment. The school governors would then have the power to introduce it if the local education authority did not exercise the power of prohibition.<br><br>
Therefore, I am sympathetic to the amendment. I am looking forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary speak on this matter. I do not propose today to vote for amendment No. 20, but I may decide differently on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lightbown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Staffordshire, South-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) on this matter. In my experience the views of the local education authority are not necessarily the same as those of the school governors. Indeed, in Staffordshire the views of the local education authority are in total conflict with those of the parents and governors. This is a matter which has to go right down to the parents and governors of schools.<br><br>
Therefore, although I have some sympathy with the attempt to pass the democratic decision down, my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham has not passed it down far enough in supporting the proposal. The statutory power has to be vested in the school governors who will no doubt consult the teachers and parents about corporal punishment on the school premises. I should not wish to see a blanket decision covering about 700 education establishments in Staffordshire made by the local education authority when it could be in conflict with the views of parents and governing bodies in at least 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. of the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a short debate on an important matter. We have the example of Manchester and the Inner London Education
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
Authority where steps have been taken to abolish the use of corporal punishment in schools. There are about 23 authorities in the land where such steps have been taken. Other authorities may use other means, and in individual schools headmasters may use informal means, like those about which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) spoke last week for bringing about effective but informal abolition.<br><br>
The amendments will extend the right of local education authorities to intervene in matters that we believe are best left to the school. Under existing arrangements, school articles of government usually assign ultimate responsibility for discipline to school governing bodies, but often in imprecise terms.<br><br>
Moreover, some articles of government give local education authorities override powers, and some local education authorities have appealed to those override powers to justify the imposition of an authority-wide ban on corporal punishment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) said that other local education authorities have used their position as employers to negotiate or impose abolition. The Committee must accept that although both approaches may be technically correct, in our view they take too much responsibility away from schools. It is the schools and not the local education authorities that should take decisions about corporal punishment. We have left that legal position unchanged in the Bill and we have not attempted to take away LEAs' powers, such as they may have.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham alluded to future legislation. They will understand that although I cannot anticipate the form, shape or nature of future legislation, a Government may seek to tidy up the issue, leaving schools, and only schools, to decide whether to use corporal punishment. To deny that possibility would be to mislead the Committee, which I will not do.<br><br>
Such legislation would entail an overhaul of schools' articles of government. That is not attempted by the Bill, which is neutral on the issue. That approach is right because corporal punishment is only one part of discipline, and discipline is only one part of the conduct of the school. We must avoid the temptation to view aspects of schools in isolation.<br><br>
In future a school may wish to challenge a local education authority's right to ban corporal punishment, and it might even resort to the courts. So be it. Members of the Committee will accept a school's right to do so if it wishes. The Bill will neither add to a school's case nor take away from it. As I have said, the Bill is neutral in that respect.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to break that neutrality by extending or confirming local education authorities' powers. If that neutrality is to be broken, it should be broken in the other direction by a reduction in local education authorities' powers in favour of schools' governing bodies. I hope that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will withdraw the amendment. The committee is deeply divided between Conservative and Opposition views on the issue, but the Bill does not interfere with the existing balance of powers on corporal punishment.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed by the Minister's statement. I hoped that he would at least make it clear that the government did not intend to encourage schools to attempt to reintroduce corporal punishment where local authorities had successfully abolished it, as appears to have happened in so many areas.<br><br>
However, the Minister has made it clear that the Bill is not intended to alter the balance.<br><br>
It is unsatisfactory to Parliament that the present law is not clear. It is admitted that local authorities are, perhaps, achieving an end by a back-door method rather than by a direct method, which is unsatisfactory. Some hon. Members have argued that governors should have the power. The balance between what governors should control and what the local authorities should control is a difficult question, but most Conservative Members would not argue that governors should have power over resources.<br><br>
There is a link between the availability of resources to a school, the form of punishments used in that school and the pattern that one wishes to set. If a local authority makes adequate resources and staff available, punishments should not have to include corporal punishment. If a local authority is doing its job properly and providing good quality teachers, equipment and resources, it should be entitled to say, "We are doing all these things for the school so you should not have to use corporal punishment.".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused about how to relate corporal punishment to management and resources. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could explain that further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a hard-pressed teacher who is teaching a class of 40 youngsters, discipline will be much more hit and miss, with some hit in it. If the pupil-teacher ratio is below 20, the need for any forms of punishment, other than raising one's voice, will be much reduced. Therefore, the availability of teachers will have a strong relationship to the forms of punishment necessary in that school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the case recently heard in mid-Glamorgan, the chairman of the education committee, councillor Philip Squire, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Sending a teacher into a classroom with no cane is like sending a boxer into a ring with one hand tied behind his back."</p></blockquote>
But councillor Squire has changed his mind now. He says that the working party studying alternative disciplinary deterrents over the past two years has shown that segregating troublemakers would mean employing 60 extra teachers, but the money is not available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there are arguments, with which I agree, for punishment being considered at the same time as the resources available to the school.<br><br>
Of particular importance are the availability in the school of a special unit for children with behaviour problems, or the possibility of a pupil being suspended and sent to attend a special unit. The real question is what is available within the school by way of punishment. If local authorities have to provide
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
the resources, there is some argument for saying that they should be involved in the overall strategy for punishment in their schools.<br><br>
I believe that in practice very few schools, or school governors, will try to challenge the present legislation as to do so would be a wasteful use of resources. I also think that few headmasters would be anxious for their governing bodies to take local authorities to court to restore headmasters' rights to thump the kids in their schools. That would cause publicity that most head teachers would not want their governing bodies to attract.<br><br>
We shall return to the amendments on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 3, line 35, leave out subsection (4) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Regulations shall make provision for the purpose of securing that, while such a register is maintained only pupils are shown in the register as liable to corporal punishment by members of the staff if it appears to the responsible body or, as the case may be, local education authority, that a parent of the pupil has indicated in writing that he wishes his child to be liable to corporal punishment.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 46, in clause 4, page 7, line 4, leave out "not to be exempt from", and insert "to be liable for".</p>
<p>No. 47, in clause 4, page 7, line 22, leave out "no pupil is" and insert "only pupils are".</p>
<p>No. 49, in clause 4, page 7, line 30, leave out "does not consent" and insert "consents".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 22 has two purposes. First, it states that when children's parents do not take the trouble to return forms, their children should not be subject to corporal punishment. That principle is important. Parents who are too feckless to return the forms will probably be those with the least control over their children. At first sight, it may look as though those children will cause problems to the school, but that the problems would be best solved by punishments other than corporal punishment within the school.<br><br>
I have had little success in convincing Conservative Members of the morality and ethics of corporal punishment, so I shall not pursue that argument. However, I should like to show Conservative Members that there are sensible administrative reasons for choosing an opt-in rather than an opt-out system.<br><br>
Under the regulations the school has to send a letter home—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Humfrey Malins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman understand the effect of his amendment? Under the Bill as drafted children's names will be put on a register and either parent may remove a name from it. That means that if either parent is against corporal punishment, the anti-corporal punishment view must prevail. But if the amendment were accepted either parent would be able to put a child's name on the register, and the pro-corporal punishment view would prevail. The Bill

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
provides that if either parent is against corporal punishment that view carries the day, whereas the amendment would provide that if either parent is in favour that view carries the day.</span></p>
<p>5.00 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a nice little technical point. The only trouble is that we should discuss it with an amendment in another group which seeks to make it clear that if either parent objects they have the overriding say. That is what the Government have said. I accept that perhaps my drafting could have been better and that I could have made it clear in amendment No. 22 rather than in another amendment which we have yet to discuss.<br><br>
I return to the administrative problem. The school has to send a letter to parents asking if they approve of corporal punishment. If they reply that they do not, the matter is straightforward. Parents might write back saying that they approve. But, for many reasons, some parents will not reply, so the local authority has to send a second letter and allow time for a reply. Eventually, the local authority will have one set of letters stating that parents approve of corporal punishment, another set from parents who do not, and, of course, some parents will not reply. A register would be compiled of those who favour it and those who do not reply.<br><br>
If a case came to court, it would be extremely difficult for a local authority to prove that two letters were sent and that no reply was received. It would be difficult administratively to establish that two letters were sent to parents and addressed correctly. The regulations state that local authorities will try to overcome the problem of where to send the letters. Secondly, there is the question of establishing that no letter was returned. It would be an administrative nightmare to try to establish that a letter was not sent back. Parents might send the letter back, but in a large school especially there is always a chance of letters being lost. There is also the chance of letters being lost in the post, but it is unreasonable to expect parents to return letters through recorded delivery.<br><br>
I shall not put too much blame on the Post Office, as my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) is here. Most hon. Members know that children are sometimes not especially efficient carriers of messages. I know from my experience in schools that pupils have a tendency to hand a letter to a member of staff assuming that it will be safely delivered to the school office, but sometimes staff do not deliver the letter as quickly as they might. Hon. Members know from working in this building that occasionally notes are thrust at them and, with the best will in the world, they are mislaid and do not arrive in the right place.<br><br>
The procedure allows errors to creep in. It should be a procedure that lends itself to accuracy and to ensuring that a register is compiled of people who have made a positive reply.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will go along with this and accept that if schools and local authorities are to continue to administer corporal punishment they need an administratively safe system. If the subsection is not amended, they will be left with doubts and worries about the procedure which may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
tip the scales in favour of those authorities in favour of abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 46,47 and 49 which are grouped with amendment No. 22. I speak with a disadvantage over my hon. Friend, because I do not have a copy of the regulations. I am not aware of their being published. I asked at our first sitting whether the regulations would be forthcoming. I cannot remember exactly what the Minister said, but they have not been sent to me and I am sure that had they been published, the Minister, with his usual courtesy, would have ensured that they were made available to me.<br><br>
Therefore, I am not aware of the regulations that will be invoked in relation to section 48B. Amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 49 are opting-in amendments to tighten the loose arrangement contained in section 48B. The Minister, with his CBI background, must be interested in precision. Amendment No. 46 which refers to section 48B(1) would make the wording much more precise as it seeks to delete the words
<br><blockquote><p> "not to be exempt from"</p></blockquote>
and insert the more positive phrase, "to be liable for". Using the words "to be liable for" will leave little room for doubt. The loose wording in the drafting of section 48B(1) leaves room for some mistake or error and I favour the more positive wording contained in amendment No. 46.<br><br>
Amendment No. 47 refers to section 48B(5) and seeks to delete the words "no pupil is" and substitute "only pupils are". That must be linked with amendment No. 49 which seeks to delete the words "does not consent" and substitute the word "consents".<br><br>
If those amendments were accepted, section 48B would have a much more positive approach to the maintenance of the register that will be kept. I know that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science is particularly interested in my identical terrible twin. I often suffered corporal punishment when I was young because of mistaken identity. I remind the Committee that I was always the good one, but was punished because of the sins of my identical twin.<br><br>
I return to those days and update the position. My virtue and goodness would still be subject to punishment because of the doubts contained in section 48B. If the much more positive wording of our amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 49 were inserted, there would be no doubt and my terrible identical twin would be subjected to corporal punishment as my name would not appear on the register—so good would I be.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept our amendments which would ensure that there was no room for doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remain slightly confused about the intention of amendment No. 22 tabled by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). If I have misunderstood it, I hope that I shall be corrected. Is it true that his amendment supports the pro-corporal punishment parent? If the amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
were accepted, such a parent would have his wishes acceded to, whereas, under the Bill, the anti-corporal punishment parent will have his wishes acceded to. If that is the intention, I sympathise with the amendment, but I apologise if I have misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to reverse the presumption in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the amendment in conjuction with one of the amendments grouped with amendment No. 73 he will see that the intention is to ensure that what the Government put into regulations should be made clear in the legislation. It is not the intention of amendment No. 22 to reverse the balance between parents who opt out and those who opt in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient for the Committee if I reply to the points relating to Scotland made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing). I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that the position in respect of the regulations has been different north and south of the border. The Department of Education and Science issued a consultation paper on how to comply with the European Court's judgment, and in Scotland we were working with the full agreement of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in respect of voluntary abolition. We are consulting COSLA about the detailed regulations, but I assure the Committee that the regulations will probably be along the same lines as the English regulations.<br><br>
I am advised that amendment No. 46 would make no difference and that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"not to be exempt from"</p></blockquote>
have an identical meaning to the words "to be liable for".<br><br>
On the wider issue, I confirm that we considered various options relating to the content of registers. We decided that a register showing pupils who are liable to the sanction would be the most appropriate and practicable method of ensuring compliance with the judgment of the European Court. If we rely on an exemption register, the scope for error will be wide with, for example, the possibility of corporal punishment being administered to a child whose name is not on the register due to administrative error. By referring to a list of pupils who may receive corporal punishment, members of staff administering such punishment would be acting on a positive record rather than the omission of a name if the register shows the pupils who are exempt.<br><br>
Our proposed system affords less scope for error. I have been advised that amendment No. 46 would make no difference, but I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that in the light of his detailed and technical points we shall look again at the detailed drafting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendment No. 22, which was moved by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), is to provide that only pupils whose parents write to say that they wish their children to be liable to corporal punishment would be so liable and that if parents fail to respond to a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
school's canvass of views, their children would be exempt.<br><br>
The Committee knows that clause 2(4) provides that under regulations parents will be able to exempt their children from corporal punishment if they give the school a written indication of their views. If parents fail to respond when schools canvass their views, we envisage that after six weeks the school will be able to enter the children as liable to corporal punishment. In those circumstances, the school will be obliged to notify the parents that in the absence of a response, their children's names have been put in the corporal punishment register.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to exempt the children of parents who fail to respond to the school's approach. I believe, as, I am sure, does the Committee, that that is wrong. If parents are indifferent, the school should be able to follow its chosen policies on corporal punishment. If parents cannot be bothered to return a form to a school, they are unlikely to have feelings strong enough to amount to a philosophical conviction, respect for which is at the heart of this legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the phrase "cannot be bothered". How does one distinguish between the parent who cannot be bothered and the parent who is bothered, but whose letter goes astray?</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to that point. The hon. Gentleman, with his usual flashing personality, is ahead of me. If the worry is that forms will be lost in transit, there is the safeguard that schools will be obliged to notify parents if they register the child without a written response. I accept that no system is absolutely proof against postal loss, but our proposed scheme makes provisions that reduce the possibility of mistakes and misunderstandings. In many instances, communication between parents and schools may not be through the post, but by way of personal contact. In the light of my explanation, I hope that the amendment is not pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. The system will cause many administrative problems for local authorities, and I may return to the matter at a later stage. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>No. 48, in clause 4, page 7, line 26, after "parent", insert "or guardian".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments, which were tabled before the Government helpfully produced the regulations for England and Wales. Regarding amendment No. 48, I understand that we do not have to worry about a definition of "parent" in the English and Welsh legislation, because it is defined in the education Act 1944. Presumably it is defined in Scottish legislation, so in those two primary pieces of legislation, there are fairly wide definitions of "parent".<br><br>
The draft regulations for England and Wales confirm that the parents will be the persons who effectively have control of the children. From my reading of the regulations it also appears to be the intention that if either parent objects, the child cannot be included in the register. I hope that the Minister will confirm that my understanding is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 48 seeks to insert "or guardian" after "parent" in Section 48B(5). If the definition of "parent" in the Scottish legislation includes guardian, the point is catered for, but I have always understood that in Scots law the words "or guardian" must be added in such cases. No doubt the Minister will clarify that point when he replies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks. The definition of "parent" in section 135 of the principal Act includes the term "guardian" and the desired effect will be achieved by the insertion of new section 48B in the principal Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 73, like a number of amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), is really about what happens when parents do not respond to the school's trawl of views. We all know that whatever system we adopt, some parents will do nothing; they will not respond to letters any more than they will respond to invitations to discuss the academic progress of their children. I accept that that applies to only a minority of parents, but that minority is likely to exist. The question that the committee must face is whether those children should be exempt. If the amendment were accepted, they would be exempt; the school would have received nothing in writing, so an entry in the corporal punishment record could not be made. I can see that from the hon. Gentleman's point of view, that result would be desirable, because the number of children liable to receive corporal punishment would be reduced.<br><br>
I hope, however, that the Committee will take the opposite view, as I do. I believe that parents who are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
indifferent and do not take the trouble to return a form to the school are, in effect, saying to the school, "We leave it to you". In those circumstances, the school would be entitled to say that the use of corporal punishment was part of its disciplinary arrangements and that the pupil should therefore be liable to it.<br><br>
Some people have argued that it may not be a question of parental indifference. Some parents may not be able to make up their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be wrong, but is the Minister talking about the earlier group of amendments? On amendment No. 73, the issue seemed clear to me. It is a question of a difference of view between one parent and another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that applies to a later amendment. With the cheerful humility for which I am famous, I must say that I think that it applies to amendment No. 25 or 26, and I shall deal with it when the time comes.<br><br>
The Bill stems from a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights concerning philosophical convictions, which are very positive beliefs, to say the least. Giving effect to the court's ruling, we are introducing a system based largely on parental wishes rather than convictions. I ask the Committee to accept that if parents cannot make up their minds about which of their views should predominate, their views do not constitute strongly held convictions, and until the parents make up their minds, the normal disciplinary arrangements of the school should prevail.<br><br>
Some have argued that the school may not receive a form because it has been lost in the post. That could happen, and as a safeguard, we propose that when the period for the return of the form has elapsed, the school should be able to enter a child name on the list as liable to corporal punishment only if a reminder has been sent to the parents telling them that in the absence of a form the child is deemed to be liable. There could, of course, be a succession of lost forms and misunderstandings. No system is absolutely foolproof, but the proposed system is as fail-safe as possible, bearing in mind the practicalities.<br><br>
I am not sure whether the Committee will go on to discuss amendments Nos. 25 and 26.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The strength of my argument lies in amendments Nos. 25, 26 and 73. That is why I was a little surprised when the Minister seemed to go back over the ground covered under the last group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would help if I gave the Government's view on amendments Nos. 25 and 26. We believe that amendment No. 25 is unnecessary. Clause 2(4) provides that when a parent of the pupil has indicated in writing that he does not consent to the pupil being liable to corporal punishment, the pupil's name cannot be entered on a corporal punishment record. Mothers or fathers may claim exemption for their children, even if the spouses disagree. In short, under the Bill as it stands, conflicts between parents are always resolved in favour of the parent seeking an exemption, and the child must be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
treated as exempt if the claim is made in writing.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 26, we envisage that—the Bill is based on this premise—a parent seeking exemption will prevail over a spouse who wishes to make a child liable to corporal punishment. That is the evitable conclusion to be reached from the Campbell and Cosans case. If we are to accord a view against corporal punishment the status of a philosophical conviction, which must be respected, we cannot allow a contrary, view. I hope that with those assurances, hon. Gentlemen will not press their amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not very happy about what the Minister has said. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 3, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4E) Regulations shall make provision that where pupils receive corporal punishment boys shall only be punished by male members of staff and girls by female members of staff'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment is tabled as a probe to the Government. They do not seem to have put into these provisions much guidance on how corporal punishment should be administered. I realise that the Government got themselves into some difficulty, because they said that they believe corporal punishment involves using the cane or any other instrument and involves a slap. A learned judge last week commented that nobody could conceivably consider a slap as part of corporal punishment, but no doubt in a court case he was not considering proposals like the ones the Government are putting forward.<br><br>
I accept that, if one is talking about a slap, the need for the amendment is not all that great, but if one is talking about the use of a cane or a strap, there are strong arguments that, particularly with pupils of secondary school age, corporal punishment should be administered only by an adult of the same sex as the pupil.<br><br>
This is a difficult area which perhaps ought to be dealt with by regulations. Will the Minister say
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
whether he feels that he can rely on existing circulars or guidance to local authorities about the administration of corporal punishment or whether he intends, either by regulations or by circular, to issue further guidance once the Bill becomes law?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the manner and circumstances in which corporal punishment is administered are important and I acknowledge that its use by male teachers on adolescent girls, for example, can cause great concern. Many schools avoid such difficulties by having their own rules about such matters.<br><br>
The amendment is fairly widely drawn and it would stop teachers taking some kinds of action to which there can be no objection, except from those who are opposed to any form of corporal punishment in any circumstances. For example, the amendment would prevent a female teacher in an infant school from smacking the leg of a troublesome boy, even when his parents were willing for him to be subject to corporal punishment. Indeed, some nursery, infant and junior schools are staffed entirely by women teachers. The amendment would mean that, subject to parental wishes, girls in such schools would be liable to corporal punishment while the boys would not. I hope, therefore, that in the light of that explanation the amendment will be rejected as impractical and as intervening in areas best left to the good sense of schools.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary has said. There are many small primary schools in my constituency and quite frequently they have a staff of only two teachers, often of one sex. It would be extremely bizarre if male teachers were unable to impose a suitable punishment on female pupils. The amendment would create an utterly unacceptable position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Flannery <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hillsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I supported the amendment I should be supporting corporal punishment, and I am totally opposed to that, but the amendment underlines the stupidity of the dilemma under which the Minister has to point out that to retain the right to hit a child on the legs in the lower classes of a primary school we must also retain the right to beat young women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flannery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-East (Mr. Lightbown) may say "Rubbish", but that is the reality. The amendment means that we shall allow men to beat young women and it underlines the utter nonsense of the Bill. We are trying to stop something disgraceful taking place, yet the effect of the amendment would be to retain something that is surely objectionable to most of mankind.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 30, in page 4, line 6, leave out from "instrument" to end of line 7 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"; the first set of regulations shall not be made unless a draft of them has been laid before and approved by each House of Parliament and further regulations shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with parliamentary control over the regulations. The Government have shown Opposition Members a draft of the regulations for England and Wales and we have had an opportunity to probe them thoroughly. We may, if we wish, return to probe them further on Report. I do not believe that we need to change the proposals for secondary legislation contained in the Bill so I shall not press the amendment, unless my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) wishes to see the Scottish regulations before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. It is clear that parliamentary control over statutory instruments is in a shambles. Whether that control be exercised by the affirmative or the negative resolution it is totally unsatisfactory. It is also clear that we should extend only the affirmative resolution procedure to statutory regulations that are of major importance. With respect to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) I do not think that these regulations come into that category.<br><br>
Furthermore, if we were to extend the affirmative procedure to such regulations, it would create a precedent that would spawn a number of affirmative resolutions. The Leader of the House would then say that we never get to bed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the Government have done the correct thing by making a draft set of regulations available so that we can discuss them as the Bill proceeds? That is why I do not wish to press the amendment to a Division. Although the Government often say that they will make regulations, those are not available while the Bill is going through. When they eventually appear they are subject to limited scrutiny of an hour and a half and that is unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept what the hon. Gentleman has said. The Government have acted properly in producing the draft regulations. There are considerable advantages in Governments always laying regulations before the House in draft form, because they can then be amended, whereas if they are laid before the House in final form, they cannot. I agree with the hon. Gentleman when he praises the Government, but I strongly resist any suggestion that we should extend the process of affirmative resolution to regulations such as this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) is right. I approve of the proposal in subsection (7) of Clause 2 to make the regulations exercisable by statutory instrument,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
subject to annulment by either House. The alternative proposed by the Opposition is generally used only to deal with matters of principle, or those with significant financial implications. In my view, no such considerations arise in this instance. Both the Education Act 1944 and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 provide for regulations to be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House, and what we propose is in line with that.</span></p>

SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Key <span class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 4, line 17, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) No headteacher of a school or responsible body as set out in subsection (1) above shall exercise any power he, or as the case may be it, may have to refuse a pupil admission to a school or suspend or expel a pupil from a school or from education provided in a school solely because the pupil is or may be exempt from corporal punishment."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following: amendment (a) to the proposed amendment at end add
<br><blockquote><p>"or has refused to consent to corporal punishment himself."</p></blockquote>
new clause 4—School admissions—
<br><blockquote><p>"No pupil shall be refused a place at a school because of the view of his parents on corporal punishment.".</p></blockquote>
new clause 5—Suspensions—
<br><blockquote><p>"No pupil shall be suspended from a school as a result of incidents arising out of the administration of corporal punishment."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that parental objections to corporal punishment or exemptions from it are not used as justification for refusing a child admission to a school or for suspending or expelling a pupil.<br><br>
In the case of Campbell <i>v.</i> Cosans, the European court found that Jeffrey Cosans's right to education, guaranteed under article 2 of protocol 1 of the European convention, had o been violated by his suspension from school for refusing to accept corporal punishment. Another application to Strasbourg, recently declared admissible by the European Commission of Human Rights, the case of Durairaj, includes a similar claim.<br><br>
In Mid-Glamorgan recently, two boys were placed under a care order as a result of their mother's opposition to corporal punishment. The two boys were suspended in similar circumstances, and that case—Jarman <i>v.</i> Mid-Glamorgan Education Authority—is also to be the subject of a complaint to Strasbourg. <i>The Times</i> commented in its law report:
<br><blockquote><p>"A mother who objected to corporal punishment and whose children had been refused admission to school because she refused to withdraw her objection was guilty of an offence under section 39(1) of the Education Act 1944 of being the parent of children of compulsory school age who failed to attend regularly at the school at which they were registered …</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
<br><blockquote><p>The children had been refused admission to the school by the headmaster on October 14, 1983 because he had been informed by the mother in a letter that she objected to any form of physical punishment being administered to her children.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The children had on three occasions been presented by the mother at the school and had been refused admission because she refused to withdraw her objection to the use of corporal punishment.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It was quite clear that the headmaster refused admission to the boys because the mother would not agree to the school's disciplinary code which included corporal punishment."</p></blockquote>
If the Bill is to satisfy the European convention, it must ensure that refusal of admission, suspension and expulsion cannot be used against those who object to corporal punishment, as the whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure respect for their convictions.<br><br>
At present, it is not uncommon for schools to make acceptance of corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure a condition of admission. For example, the admissions document for the London Oratory School, a voluntary aided Roman Catholic boys' school in Seagrave Road, London, reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Places will be offered to the 180 most suitable candidates and the decision will be made in the light of the following factors: acceptance of firm discipline and the school regulations (including the use of corporal punishment)."</p></blockquote>
Furthermore, Salemoor secondary modern school Sale which comes under the borough of Trafford education committee writes the following in its admissions document on the subject of discipline:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where necessary… we use an official detention system, notifying parents in advance, and also use corporal punishment. Parents of pupils admitted to the school are deemed to have accepted our disciplinary procedures."</p></blockquote>
While the Bill would oblige schools to ensure that once a child had been admitted, a parent's objection to corporal punishment were respected, there appears to be nothing in its provisions to prevent schools from making such objections a bar to admission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). It is the policy of the Government to promote parental choice in the placing of their children. Unless the amendment or something similar is accepted, parental choice will be frustrated in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that there is some support for that view on Conservative Benches. Amendment No. 69 is good. It addresses itself to much the same problems that the Opposition have addressed in the new clauses, at least in new clause 4. However, it would be unfortunate if the provisions of the legislation restricted parental choice on schools.<br><br>
At an earlier stage I mentioned that the head of a particularly popular primary school might insist on canvassing the parents' views on corporal punishment before putting the child's name on the register. The Minister said that of course that should not happen, but the parents would have the right to change their minds at any time and so would be able to express one view when putting their child on the list but could easily change their minds later. I certainly would not expect a parent to have to enter into that sort of deceit.<br><br>
I do not expect that there will be too much trouble with a child being entered for primary or even
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
secondary school. The difficulty I envisage concerns the young person of 14 or 15 who is suspended from a school and for whom, the local authority has to find an alternative school. When someone in the education offices rings a particular head and says, "Will you take this pupil on? I am afraid he has been suspended for this, that and the other", the head may be tempted to say that as long as he can apply corporal punishment he will accept him. That will not be because the head is particularly enthusiastic about corporal punishment, but it is a simple way of not accepting that pupil.<br><br>
When I was a councillor and governor in Oldham before it was reorganised into comprehensive schools, there was often a problem of placing a disruptive pupil. One school had a reputation for flogging pupils into submission and another had a reputation for achieving the same results through kindness. Ironically all the other secondary moderns appeared to be able to avoid having disruptive pupils sent to them because they did not have the reputation for being able to cope with them in either of those ways.<br><br>
I suggest to the Minister that unless the amendment is accepted, there will be problems for local authority education administrators when trying to place a pupil who has a record of behaviour problems.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) on his ingenuity and the amount of time that he spent researching these examples. He must be one one of the most hardworking Members of Parliament. Time after time he comes forward with original points of view, and he must have spent many hours in the Library collecting his information. I am sure that his constituents in Salisbury will be pleased to know that I am congratulating him today on his great application. —<i>[Interruption.]</i> Being in the Committee is like being part of a Greek chorus at times, with voices both off and on stage.<br><br>
I have sympathy for the point of view behind the amendment, although sympathy must never be taken as a sign of weakness. The Government believe that no parent should bear an unreasonable burden in order to gain respect for a philosophical conviction.<br><br>
Debarment of a son or daughter from school, referred to in the amendment, would be such an unreasonable burden. The possibility of a refusal to admit a child to a school on the grounds of a parental claim for exemption would be removed operationally by regulations, which would require a school to put questions about parental views after the child has been accepted by the school.<br><br>
If the intention of new clause 4 is to ensure that no child will be refused a place at school because of the parents' wish to prevent that child from receiving corporal punishment, I have some sympathy with that view. A parent seeking an exemption for their child should not be penalised. However, regulations will provide sufficient safeguards. They will ensure that the question of corporal punishment will be put to parents after a school place has been secured. That, and the right of parents to change their minds at any

time, should prevent schools being tempted to put pressure on parents who seek exemptions. I think that we referred earlier to the possibility of the safeguard in regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary said meets the anxiety that pupils might be refused entry to a school. However, it does not meet the anxiety that a pupil might subsequently be expelled. No doubt he will touch on that in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I was about to touch on that. I think that the Committee will accept that the last point especially is a difficult area. None of us would wish to take away from a school the right to suspend a child in the event of the school deeming that to be necessary. I should like to invite my Hon. Friend not to press the amendment on the grounds that, in the light of my candid and refreshing explanation, it would be impolite to do so. If hon. Members wish to return to the matter on Report, I shall be pleased to consider it then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend was saying that he would not wish to prevent the school from expelling a pupil on the grounds that consent had been withdrawn. I think that some hon. Members would wish the school's right to expel in those circumstances to be restricted. What does my hon. Friend have in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have in mind the latter interpretation. I shall be happy to return to this matter on Report, to make sure that there is no doubt that I have taken on board the thrust of the amendment. I urge my hon. Friend not to press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what my hon. Friend says, I am delighted not to press the matter to a vote tonight. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

RESTRICTION ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT OF PUPILS—SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only a few brief points and I do not intend to delay the Committee.<br><br>
I mentioned earlier the difficulties under which I have been working because of the lack of regulations. First, clause 4 is irrelevant. We have wasted a great deal of Parliamentary time on the Bill. We should have done better to have gone straight for abolition without any of this nonsense. I want to put on record that when the Labour party is returned to power and when I am back in the Scottish Office we shall abolish corporal punishment. I do not want there to be any doubt whatever about that.<br><br>
I know that there are ears in the Room to which I am not supposed to refer. When their owners have time they like to doodle. They can doodle on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
preparing abolition legislation to get rid of corporal punishment as soon as the Labour party comes back to power.<br><br>
Will the Minister say what arrangements the Scottish Office will make to discuss the regulations when they become available? The usual Scottish Office tactic of getting some Tory Member to table a planted question for a written answer will not be satisfactory. We want from the Minister an absolute guarantee that there will be a statement on the Floor of the House when the regulations are available.<br><br>
The Minister is laughing. He could have saved himself the trouble if the regulations had been available. They are not, and the trouble is of the Government's own making. When the regulations are available I am sure that the Minister will not want to put his Scottish colleagues at a disadvantage vis-avis English Members, who have had the advantage of debating the Bill against a background of the availability of the regulations—which Scottish Members have not.<br><br>
I press the Minister to have the regulations available on Report, which I assume will be in two or three weeks' time. That will be adequate time for him to make the regulations available. If we cannot have them until after Report, I shall be right to insist that we have a statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the position on the draft regulations is different north and south of the border because of the reasons that I gave earlier. South of the border, the Department of Education and Science consulted authorities, but in Scotland it was agreed between the Government and the authorities that the authorities would move towards voluntary abolition.<br><br>
The regulations will be laid before the House in the usual way and can be prayed against by hon. Members. I shall try to reassure the hon. Gentleman on the question of timing. We must now consult the convention on the details of the regulations. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the document that will go to the convention will be available in time for Report. However, that document will not necessarily be the draft regulations, because we shall still have to wait for COSLA's comments.</span></p>

Grantham (Mr. Hogg) pointed out that secondary legislation for Great Britain was not very satisfactory. If anything is less satisfactory it is secondary legislation for Northern Ireland. There is a tendency for Northern Ireland Members to find little opportunity to debate such issues. It would have been reasonable for the Minister to make a brief statement. I suspect that the information has been passed to him. That will save him having to write me a letter and the answer can go on the record.</span></p>

Clause 5 provides for the Order in Council extending the provisions of the Bill to Northern Ireland to be subject to negative resolution. We have already discussed the case made in favour of regulations under clauses 2 and 4 being subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House. For Northern Ireland, it is important that we follow the same course for the Order in Council. I trust that the Committee will accept the clause.</span></p>

SHORT TITLE, COMMENCEMENT AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 9, line 7, leave out from "on" to end of line 10 and insert "1st January 1986".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 55, in page 9, line 7, leave out from "on" to end of line 10 and insert "1st August 1985.".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to find out from the Government when they intend to implement the legislation. The Minister may say that the date will depend on the Bill's progress through the rest of its stages in this House and in another place. However, despite the stupidities contained in the Bill, I should have expected the Minister to be able to make a reasonable prediction of when it will get through both Houses, and to tell the Committee the date when he wants it to come into operation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 54 offers the Government a reasonable timetable, making it quite clear to schools that the Bill will be in effect from 1 January 1986. I can see merits in amendment No. 55 tabled by the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud). He suggests 1 August 1985 and has the advantage of starting the new system at the beginning of a school year. The regulations would operate from September, allowing time for the notice to be given.<br><br>
I can see that there are advantages in not putting a date on the face of the Bill, but I hope that the Government will make it clear that it is their intention to bring the Bill into operation either in time for the whole of the coming school year, or, at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
least, on 1 January 1986. It would be unsatisfactory if the present arrangements were to continue for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments propose that the legislation should take effect either on 1 August 1985 or 1 January 1986. We believe that schools need more time than the amendments offer to review their disciplinary arrangements and to canvass the views of parents, and to reach decisions about the provision of exemptions. Those considerations suggest full implementation of the scheme by 1 September 1986, allowing schools to canvass the views of parents, set up registers and so on, some six months before that date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are making a meal out of the bureaucracy of the Bill. I think that many local authorities and many schools will take a hint from the Minister's reply and work at phasing out so that by the time the legislation comes into force those schools will not have to operate the measure.<br><br>
To insist on waiting a whole year after the passage of the Bill seems totally unnecessary—if the Government believe in the legislation. They are perhaps waiting to hear from the European Court about further rulings which might make the whole Bill a non-starter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We believe that 1 September 1986 will give schools sufficient time to get themselves organised. It is essential to allow schools to start work setting up registers six months before 1 September 1986. I am glad that we have the agreement of the Opposition to that date.</span></p>

LIMITATIONS ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>"Corporal punishment given to a pupil under the terms of this Act shall not be given on more than one occasion in any week; and no more than two strokes of the cane, strap, or any other instrument used for the purpose of the administration of corporal punishment shall be given at any one time."—<i>[Mr. Bennett.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
All of us have made it clear that we do not like corporal punishment, although some Conservative Members argue that it is necessary. If we are to justify it, it must be on the basis of its use in moderation and its having to be administered is far more serious than any injury that may be inflicted as a result of it. Therefore, there ought to be some restriction, either in the Bill or in regulations, on the amount of corporal punishment that can be administered.<br><br>
Corporal punishment clearly is not working in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
school if a pupil has to be punished more than once a week, and there can be no justificaton for a pupil being given more than two strokes of the cane or strap. We need not spend long on this debate, because I suspect that the Committee will divide along the same lines on this amendment as it has on others. However, I hoped that at least some Conservative Members would feel that there ought to be a limitation—in either the Bill or regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is designed to provide a means by which a parent may exempt a child from corporal punishment at school. New clause 1 is about something different—the extent to which, and the manner in which, corporal punishment is applied. It is a kind of half-way house towards abolition, and, like the proposal for abolition, it is interventionist. It attempts to take decisions away from schools and teachers, and it substitutes central enforcement for local discretion. From a practical point of view, it would mean that corporal punishment could be used the first time in a week that a child misbehaved, but on subsequent occasions it could not be used.<br><br>
On Second Reading, much was said about consistent treatment of a child or children committing misdemeanours in school. The amendment would make for inconsistent treatment for each child. Sometimes a child could be caned, at other times the same child could not be caned. All that would depend upon what that teacher, or another, had done earlier in the week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if the new clause were accepted it would lead to the bizarre result that if a young child had misbehaved, albeit in a rather trifling way and had been slapped, and subsequently within the week behaved in a worse way, he could not then be subjected to corporal punishment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend's interpretation. That is the riduculous situation in which a school would find itself in its attempt to maintain order and discipline.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) talked a great deal about resources and administration and the cost of record keeping. What about the record-keeping — the logging of the weekly quota for each child? It would be a burden way beyond anything that we envisage in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the school has to maintain a punishment book, and that although there may be doubt whether the book contains records of individual slaps, the school would be in gross breach of regulations if the book did not contain records of all other forms of corporal punishment administered there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree slightly. I am worried that the new clause is an attempt, partially by back-door methods, to frustrate the aims of the Bill. As for the number of strokes of the cane or other instrument, there is already a legal remedy for those who are subjected to immoderate or unreasonable corporal punishment.<br><br>
The new clause attempts to define what is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
acceptable when an instrument is used, but does not refer to slaps and smacks on the leg. I hope that the amendment will be seen by the Committee as an unacceptable broadening of the Bill in a matter that is best left to the common sense of schools. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will reject the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in the Minister's remarks. The argument for corporal punishment is that it deters pupils. If it has been administered weakly and has not deterred the pupil becoming involved in further problems, it must have been inappropriate to use it the first time and teachers should look for alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is the point. A teacher must use his discretion and judgment. The hon. Gentleman said that a teacher should look for an alternative punishment. That may be true, but the teacher is the best judge of determining the most appropriate punishment, so the amendment is nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have a problem. Good schools have already abolished corporal punishment and they manage to administer their schools effectively and maintain discipline. There is widespread evidence that discipline has not deteriorated and they have a better record with regard to attacks on teachers and so on since corporal punishment was abolished. The good schools, with sensible teachers, find such punishment is not necessary.<br><br>
We should examine the bad schools. Many complaints about corporal punishment have arisen because of a few schools which administer it unreasonably and use it far too frequently. Often, the punishments meted out by some teachers are completely out of proportion. The Minister says that a parent has the right to sue, but many reasonable parents are worried about taking court action. They do not want the expense; they do not want their child dragged through the courts; and, although they believe that the teacher has behaved unreasonably, they do not wish to damage his career.<br><br>
I remember from my teaching experience when a parent justifiably complained about the unreasonable use of corporal punishment by one of my colleagues. The head teacher worked extremely hard to persuade the parent that, although the teacher should not have done it, the parent should not go to court because it would damage the reputation of the school and the teacher.<br><br>
That is one of the problems with the legislation. We must examine the few bad schools in which there is an unreasonable amount of corporal punishment. That is why I believe that the sort of limitation that would be provided by the new clause is perfectly justified. We should tell a school that it must keep a punishment book and if a child's name appears frequently, there must be something wrong with the punishment being administered.<br><br>
I accept that the amendment is not especially well drafted. It is for the Government to put forward some sort of regulations. It is wrong for a child to be caned daily, which shows that the punishment is not working. Sadly, that still happens in a few schools.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
If punishment is to become a ritual and emphasis is put on the disgrace of being punished rather than physical hurt, two strokes would be adequate. When more than two strokes of a cane or strap are administered, damage may be caused to children's hands or other parts of their bodies.<br><br>
I see that I shall not make much progress with the Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

 PUNISHMENT BOOK</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"Regulations made under section 2 of this Act and section 48B of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 shall provide that in schools where a register is maintained for the purposes of the administration of corporal punishment, a punishment book shall be kept in which shall be recorded all incidents of corporal punishment and all other punishments administered by the school to be equivalent to corporal punishment, to those pupils not on the register.". —<i>[Mr. Bennett.]</i></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'> Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 57, in Schedule, page 10, line 10, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Maintenance of punishment book to record incidents of corporal punishment etc.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to find a little more sympathy from Conservative Members for the spirit of the amendment if not the wording. The problem is that schools are required to keep a punishment book that records all forms of corporal punishment if an instrument such as a cane or strap is used to administer the punishment. That requirement was reinforced by circular from the Government after a case involving a Cheshire school in the late 1960s. Guidance was given to school governors and they were told that one of their duties was to check the punishment book before governors' meetings. Following the issue of that circular school governors were asked to initial the book to show that they had looked at it.<br><br>
The problem is that if there is insistence that all forms of corporal punishment are recorded in the book, someone flicking through the book may see that the name of pupil "x" appears three or four times and the impression may be created that that pupil has been a troublemaker. Yet another pupil whose parents exempted him from corporal punishment will not appear in that book although he may have committed more crimes and have received more punishments which were not recorded because the regulations did not require it.<br><br>
The spirit of the amendment is that when schools use serious punishments—corporal punishment is clearly one example—a record should be kept of pupils who have committed serious offences that were punished by methods other than corporal punishment. That is only fair. Children whose parents opt them out of corporal punishment should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
not be opted out of being placed on record in a punishment book.<br><br>
It is important that the governors have some record in the school of serious misdemeanours which the head teacher feels would previously have justified corporal punishment but now justifies another action.<br><br>
This is a difficult area and I hope that the Minister will give the Committee some information about how he envisages punishment books being maintained when the legislation comes into effect. The Minister's interpretation of corporal punishment seems to have broadened to include the smack. I believe that that is most people's interpretation. Does the Minister believe that the smack should be included in the punishment book?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary will consider the amendment sympathetically. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has made a good point and it seems to be desirable that there should be a comprehensive record of serious misdemeanours committed by pupils. If the punishment book is confined to instances of corporal punishment the record will be incomplete.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again I disappoint my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Hogg) and the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). I do not believe that the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham is shared by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. Schools already record instances of corporal punishment in punishment books. The amendment does not seek to impose a burden on schools that avoid using corporal punishment but it would put an additional obligation —a sort of supplementary penalty—on those who seek to retain corporal punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a clever debating point. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary is right, but the error is a drafting one. The hon. Gentleman seeks to ensure that the regulations provide for a comprehensive record of serious misdemeanours, whether or not the school governors have elected to use corporal punishment in their school. The amendment is defective for the reasons outlined by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. He does not need to persuade us about that, but he must deal with the substantive merits.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An invitation of that quality from my hon. Friend cannot be resisted, but we are dealing with this amendment in its imperfect form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I moved the amendment, I made it quite clear that I was not sticking to the actual words, but was speaking more to the spirit of the amendment. I had hoped that the Minister would accept that there were difficulties for the Opposition in getting the drafting right. It is particularly annoying in Committee when, having slaved over the drafting of an Opposition amendment, the Government, even if they accept it, still
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
insist on mucking up the wording to make it clear that there is only one accurate point in our drafting. If the Minister will tell me how to draft the amendment correctly, I shall be delighted if either of us moved it on Report. It is a little unfair and out of the Committee's spirit to attack the amendment's drafting rather than to consider it in the spirit in which it was moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would never stamp on a man's neck when he is lying before me, and I shall accept the hon. Gentleman's invitation to suggest how he might draft the amendment, on the condition that I might choose to oppose it. I do not seek to impose an extra burden on any school as a result of our deliberations in Committee or on the Floor of the House. We cannot accept that schools are working hard to respond to a number of initiatives, either from the local authority or the Secretary of State, and then lay ourselves open to the charge that we are creating extra work and activity for the schools. However, I will undertake to have words with the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, separately and independently, and I hope he will not press the matter to a division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not wish to press the amendment to a division, but has the Minister any thoughts about what is now to go in the punishment book? Does he expect all the slaps that have been described in Committee to be recorded, or does he expect the punishment book merely to record incidents of the strap and cane, as at present?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not expect to have slaps and smacks recorded in the punishment book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will agree to come back to this, because when serious punishment has to be meted out in school there should be equality between those who are subject to corporal punishment and those who are subject to other punishments because their parents have taken them off the list.<br><br>
It also seems logical to me that, if a school has abolished corporal punishment, some record of serious misdemeanours should be kept in that school if they have been dealt with in a serious way. The Minister may say that that is administrative bureaucracy, but if governors are to have a real influence on the school there should be some attempt to report to them the few cases of serious misbehaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All serious offences not recorded in the punishment book are recorded elsewhere, and in my experience they are normally contained in the headmaster's report to the governing body. One cannot just suspend a pupil for a few days or propose to expel a pupil. Minor misdemeanours involving being kept in after school for half an hour, for example, should not have to be recorded in a punishment book. Matters of serious formal discipline are already recorded as a matter of routine in the headmaster's report to the governing body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely convinced that that happens. The whole point of the amendment is to seek enlightenment from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
Government about how their circulars and regulations are adapted in the light of this legislation on punishment books. The Minister said that he would at least look at the matter and I hope that on that basis we can, if necessary, return to it on Report. I accept that there are some difficulties in drafting and I suspect that there may be more in preparing it for Report. However, we shall seek to overcome that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No 58, in page 10, line 15, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"Consultation with the staff of the school in relation to the responsible body's decision not or no longer to maintain a register. Arrangements for alternative sanctions.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment was tabled to secure a debate on consultation between the governors and school staff about alternative sanctions. The problem is that the Bill is narrow and deals with only one form of discipline. It would have been better if the Government had agreed to allow the special Committee procedure. That would have given people a better opportunity to canvas the alternatives to corporal punishment and how schools could proceed without it.<br><br>
It is particularly important that schools should arrange for proper debate on the issue of discipline amongst the staff, governors and, when the decision lies with them, the local authorities. If possible, the parents and older pupils should also be involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lightbown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman pulls a face, but if one is trying to persuade pupils to exercise self-discipline, which is important, the older pupils should themselves be asked about discipline. Sometimes they are more enthusiastic than adults about violence in imposing discipline. There should be discussions about the proper form of discipline for an institution. In many institutions, proper discussion would go a long way towards bringing about self-discipline.<br><br>
It would be unfortunate if this legislation were put on the statute book without local authorities and schools having spent some time discussing the whole issue of discipline and the role of parents. It is unfortunate that parents are involved in the legislation in only a negative way. They are asked whether they consent to the schools doing something for them. They are not asked about their responsibility in encouraging pupils to take notice of discipline in schools and about ensuring that co-operation between parents and teachers.<br><br>
It is sad that in too many schools co-operation between parent and teacher does not exist—each undermines the other sometimes. In some schools which I visit, the teachers say, "You can't expect very much from the kids round here—their parents aren't up to much". If they say that to a visitor, in all sorts of ways they are saying the same to the children when they teach them.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1984-1985V002P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that is it wrong, but it happens. The result is that the children get the impression that the teachers do not think much of their parents, and the natural reaction of the parents is to criticise the teachers. It is not surprising that some children when they reach the age of 13 or 14 have little respect for their parents and teachers. It is important for us to encourage co-operation between parents and teachers. That* would go a long way towards solving many discipline problems.<br><br>
The survey by <i>The Times</i> referred to the number of parents who think that it is a good idea for teachers to discipline their children. That is sad, because in saying that, the parents are opting out disciplining their children themselves. It would have been far better under this Bill to have had a debate on the whole question of discipline in schools, rather than on the narrow area of corporal punishment. I regret that such discussion could be slipped in only at this late stage of the Bill, as a very brief debate on the possibility of introducing a new amendment.<br><br>
Do the Government have any proposals for consultation with local authorities about discipline and the suspension of pupils? I believe that that is almost as big a scandal as the misuse of corporal punishment. A pupil in one local authority might be suspended and nothing will happen for months.<br><br>
A pupil in my constituency was suspended in July because he refused to accept corporal punishment in school. For six months he remained outside school, legally truanting. When I traced the matter back, I found that he was to be subjected to corporal punishment because he had been truanting. He had been apprehended by a teacher out of school, the teacher had attempted to remonstrate with him and the pupil had used abuse at the teacher. The pupil had then been told to come to school and to suffer corporal punishment. He went to school and told the teachers to get lost. The school did not have much alternative but suspend the pupil, but he was then legally indulging in truanting for which he had been apprehended. That is unsatisfactory.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister is aware that throughout the country many pupils are suspended, and everybody hopes that the pupil can be forgotten about until he reaches the statutory school leaving age. The Government should have found an opportunity to discuss this problem in its entirety, as some people suggest that the Bill might lead to extra suspensions. I do not believe that it will, but it might. The Government should set down clear regulations for the local authorities about the suspension of pupils.<br><br>
If pupils are to be suspended from a school, the local authority must have a duty to find an alternative place for him to continue his education — otherwise attendance at school comes into question. Many people are worried about the way in which some schools suspend pupils and make no alternative provision for them.<br><br>
The Government should make a proper survey of discipline in schools and examine suspensions and alternative sanctions. They should offer good practice guidance to local authorities on all these aspects. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
would have been far better for the reputation of Parliament if we could have discussed all these issues instead of the narrow issue of corporal punishment and this bizarre Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Key</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are one hundred and one educational issues which the House should discuss at some time, but this is not the place. I hope that the Minister will resist the amendment for two reasons. The first is that we would be in grave danger of formalising and fossilising the consultative process. When a school is properly managed, consultation should be continuous; it should certainly not degenerate into management by committee. I have had some experience of a school. Every problem that arose almost every day was solved by the headmaster establishing yet another committee to advise the school on how to resolve the problem — with the result that not a lot happened. I should add that in any good school pupils of every age should be involved in discipline.<br><br>
My second reason for hoping that the Minister will resist the amendment is that, where the governors are doing their job properly in appointing the head teacher, the governors, the head and the staff should be in accord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) so rightly reminds the Committee, the Bill is not about available alternative punishments but about corporal punishment. I should like to follow the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) down the road that he so skilfully created, but it would do us no good to do that today. The points that he raised are for another place at another time in a different context.<br><br>
Amendment No. 58 would allow, but not oblige, the Secretary of State to make regulations, first, about a school governing body consulting staff when a decision not to use corporal punishment was taken and, secondly, about sanctions as an alternative to corporal punishment.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
There is no cause to make regulations about consultations between responsible bodies and school staff when a decision to abandon corporal punishment is taken. Indeed, a wise approach on the part of the governing body would be to take account of the staffs views.<br><br>
It has been said often enough in the Committee and on Second Reading that many teachers wish to retain corporal punishment, and I hope that governing bodies will take that into account when they go through their deliberations. But central Government have a limited role in this area. It is an interventionist role, and unwelcome. Those matters are best left to local discretion and resolution.<br><br>
The same applies to sanctions, which are an alternative to corporal punishment. They can best be handled by individual schools. The Government should not enter this marshy territory at any time, under any conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that although schools should have powers over many things, suspensions pose a

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
problem, because when the school suspends, the local authority has a duty to follow it up? What are the Minister's views on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wondered whether the Chairman would let me go down that road, even if I wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Hogg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham says in such a robust fashion, it would be out of order, and I would not attempt to get on the wrong side of you, Mr. Morris.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it were grossly out of order, you would have stopped me, Mr. Morris, when I introduced the matter.<br><br>
I realise that the Minister does not want to tell us about suspensions, but sooner or later the Government will have to tackle the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not attempt to trespass further on your good nature, Mr. Morris, as I have been invited to do. I said that the matter would be subject to debate at another time and in another place. It is for the hon. Gentleman to seek that through the usual channels. I shall be delighted to join him in debating those matters to which he has drawn our attention, but not now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of that invitation, and as you, Mr. Morris—perhaps with a little guidance from the Clerk—felt that the amendment was in order, if I withdrew it now, I might be able to discuss the matter on Report. Perhaps by then the Minister will have put a few views together about alternative sanctions and especially about the knotty problem of suspensions. I shall certainly seek an opportunity to return to the matter.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill to the House.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be remiss of me if I did not thank you, Mr. Morris, for the excellent way in which you have chaired our proceedings with good humour. You have been firm, but fair and very tolerant of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) for the last few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I join the Minister in thanking you, Mr. Morris? I extend my thanks to the Clerk who, as always, has been extremely helpful in assisting the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Freud</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There used to be a temptation to blame the messenger for the substance of his message. By the same token one is tempted to blame the Chairman of a Committee for the failure of the legislation over which he presides. I want to make it clear that that is not remotely my intention.<br><br>
I compliment you, Mr. Morris, for presiding over the Committee with skill, patience and understanding and with a realisation that it is often easier to let hon. Members ramble on than to pull them up. I have not previously sat under your Chairmanship, Mr. Morris, but I should like to do so again. Juries are sometimes exempted from further jury duty because of the misery of the case that they have heard. I hope that the Chairman's Panel will look similarly upon you, Mr. Morris.</span></p>
