	<section>
	<div class='title'>REPAYMENT SUPPLEMENT IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN DELAYED PAYMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 21, line 6, leave out paragraph (d).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take amendment No. 106, in page 21, leave out line 8 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'101 per cent of the payment which was in fact due, or £10 in excess of that payment, whichever is the greater'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is designed to remove the rule that no repayment supplement shall be due if the repayment shown on the taxpayer's return is more than £10 over the right amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why clause 19(1)(d) is in the Bill, as it seems to impose an extraordinarily severe test on the taxpayer. For example, if the correct repayment is £1 million, and by mistake the taxpayer's return shows £11 more than that, the effect is that no repayment supplement at all is due. I feel that Customs and Excise is quite adequately protected against excessive claims for repayment by clause 13(1)(c), over which we laboured long. That provision provides for full penalties for serious misdeclarations or neglect. Of all the provisions of this part of the Bill, clause 19(1)(d) seems the most draconian and the least defensible. Will my hon. Friend assure the Committee that he will remove it from the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As in most matters, I find myself more conservative than my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), who has taken the radical route of suggesting that the whole provision be dropped. I take my hon. Friend's substantive point—it is a little harsh that simply because a taxpayer has claimed £10 over and above the repayment due he should lose his while entitlement under clause 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for example, a major firm involved in a large contract. It has no VAT outputs but a large number of VAT inputs and therefore a large and substantive repayment, running perhaps into hundreds of thousands of pounds, is due to it. It is a little much to expect that firm to be able to calculate its claim figure to within the nearest £10. I differ from my hon. Friend in that I think that if a taxpayer is claiming a repayment he should use every possible endeavour to make sure
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
that that repayment is calculated as accurately as possible. Amendment No. 106 proposes that he must be within 1 per cent of the actual repayment due. For very large repayments 1 per cent may be too generous, but I could not think of a better way of making the substantive point in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister of State to accept the amendment in its present form, but I hope that between now and Report he will be able to work on it in the confident expectation that he can come up with a fairer and more reasonable rule than the Bill lays down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By working out what the surcharge rule should be and deciding that all the money should be lost because of overclaiming, the penalty could be extraordinary harsh in some circumstances, as the hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) has said, if the motive were not to fiddle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people fill in their tax returns or make any statement on tax, they find it complicated. Small companies take advice from accountants and tax advisers and try to ensure that they get as much return as possible. I am not advocating leniency towards tax fiddling—the Labour party does not stand for that—but if a genuine mistake has been made, for a company to lose all its entitlement would be over the top and harsh. Surely discretion should be used, and I hope that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise would look at such a case and deal with the matter accordingly rather than adhering to a strict rule whereby all moneys and entitlements would be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where the argument hinges. I want a provision that establishes the motive and determines whether there was intent to fiddle or whether an authentic mistake had been made, such as could arise from the sheer complexity of our taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond first to the points made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Randall).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is an "intent to fiddle", it will be covered by other clauses which deal with situations where there is an attempt to behave improperly. We are considering what happens when errors have been made in the claim for repayment. The Committee is more tolerant but perhaps less aware of the great accuracy that the vast majority of traders live up to. I am advised that 93 per cent of repayment returns are accurate and meet the requirements in the Bill. We are talking about only 7 per cent that are more than £10 out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even so, my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West think that that is a bit harsh. I appreciate that when large sums are involved £10 seems jolly small in comparison, but I prefer not to seek to gear it in percentage terms, as my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) has suggested, although I am willing to think about increasing the £10 to £100, because that would mean that nearly 98 per cent of claims would be covered. That is not unreasonable in the circumstances. However, I should like to reflect and take account of representations. It is very interesting how accurate the returns are over all, and it seems that only a very few do not live up to that accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the legislation should contain a tiny incentive in favour of the accurate and provide a marginal penalty, at least, on a trader who is inaccurate in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
his payment, particularly when those inaccuracies are in favour of the trader rather than the revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eggar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what my hon. Friend said. However, a trader may make a mistake in his quarterly accounts. He may itemise an input which he may not be invoiced for until the beginning of the next quarter. It might involve a considerable sum. The assurance I seek, apart from the increase to £100, which I welcome, is that when a reasonable customs official has realised that an error has been made, the subsection will not be used against the honest and honourable trader.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I shall reflect upon the limit and see whether the sum should be raised from £10 to £100. That would meet what has been said and, therefore, cover the majority of traders. I shall certainly reflect upon the point made by my hon. Friend about motivation. I am sure that "reasonable excuse" will run in somewhere. It seems to run through most of our legislation. I hope that the Committee will accept my assurance that I shall consider the matter, without commitment—as ever. I am always advised to use those words. I shall reconsider those matters in harmony with what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of our debates call upon the Government to justify their proposals so that at least we understand what is at issue. Can the Minister confirm that clause 19 covers people who are entitled to payments under section 14(5) of the 1983 Act when a credit or excess is due to the trader? As I understand it, if an amount on the return is more than £10 above the proper amount, a person forfeits the right to any interest. That seems a little harsh. Rather than raise the figure from £10 to £100, the Minister should make sure that there is a let-out for those traders who have made a genuine or reasonable mistake. Surely that is a better approach than simply upping the amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a helpful intervention. I hope that I gave the impression that I would reflect both on the amount and upon the motives to see whether we could find a reasonable compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 90 per cent of repayments are made within 10 days. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North has had a particular constituency case which has involved large sums of money, and he will know that as long as monthly-repayment traders make their returns on time, Customs and Excise processes those returns and gets the repayments out on time. There is a high record of compliance by Customs and Excise, and if the same record of compliance came from the taxpayer, we would not need these clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we all agree with my hon. Friend's last comment. I welcome his willingness to accommodate the points made by both sides of the Committee on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished to hear about the high level of accuracy in applications made by taxpayers. Even so, that tends to lend force to our arguments rather than weaken them. I said in my opening remarks that sufficient powers are already available to Customs and Excise in clause 13 to provide for serious misdeclarations and neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
It is wrong to introduce a penal element into the clause to cover a small number of cases which, if they are outside the ambit of clause 13, are bound to be innocent mistakes. We should not be in the business of penalising people who make innocent mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of my hon. Friend's willingness to consider those points I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill. </i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 20</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ASSESSMENTS: TIME LIMITS AND SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 22, line 5, leave out "increased" and insert "ceased".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is apparent, this rectifies a typographical error in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 22, line 41, after "Commissioners", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or, on appeal the VAT Tribunal".</p></blockquote>
The amendment can be dealt with briefly, as it concerns the circumstances in which an assessment has been made but where the assessment does not readily cover any one prescribed accounting period, but straddles a number. That, perfectly properly, is a matter that should be put within the discretion of the commissioners. The amendment simply allows the right of appeal to the VAT tribunal in circumstances where the commissioners, who have a fairly wide discretion, may determine to the best of their judgment that it is right to allow an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important because the accounting period to which the commissioners adjudge or attribute any of the payments makes a difference to the amount of interest, surcharge or penalties. What the commissioners do is not simply a matter of administration. When they ascribe something to a particular accounting period it will end up having an affect on the amount of money that the trader pays. For that reason, amendment No. 45 seeks to provide the right of appeal to a VAT tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has suggested, this is a relatively narrow point. It is when Customs and Excise discovers amounts of assessable tax which cannot be directly related to individual accounting periods and, bearing in mind that sometimes that discovery goes back many years, it is impossible to allocate it precisely to the quarter concerned. Customs and Excise apparently, assesses such amounts using bulk assessment covering more than one period. However, with the advent of period specific interest, surcharge and penalties, that is no longer possible, because it could lead to considerable unfairness. Clause 20(3) authorises Customs and Excise to attribute such amounts of tax to individual prescribed accounting periods, and in doing so it must exercise its best judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under existing legislation—section 40(1)(m) of the Value Added Tax Act 1983—people may appeal against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
the amount of any tax assessment. Clause 24(1) of this Bill extends that right of appeal to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of any penalty, interest or surcharge specified in an assessment under section 20".</p></blockquote>
So there is an increase in traders' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows, therefore, that when an amount of penalty, interest or surcharge is tax geared, and is dependent upon the amount of tax, the amount of tax, including any attributions to periods by Customs and Excise, can be taken to the VAT Tribunal on appeal. In those circumstances, Customs and Excise will have to demonstrate that its attribution was made to the best of its judgment. So the onus of proof is on Customs and Excise to show that best judgment has been used, for otherwise the appeal will succeed. The safeguard which the amendment seeks to introduce is already provided in clause 24, coupled with the existing provisions of the Value Added Tax Act 1983. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore think it right not to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would obviously be churlish of me to press my amendment in the circumstances. I am happy with the Minister's assurance and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 23, leave out line 25 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is actually remedied or paid".</p></blockquote>
This is a small matter, and the Minister can perhaps give us the same assurance that he gave on the previous amendment. It relates to the date on which a person becomes liable to a penalty under clause 16 or interest under clause 17, and the date from which the penalty or interest begins to run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As subsection (6) stands, the date from which the penalty or interest begins to run is the date mentioned in subsection (5), which is the date given in the notice of assessment. That means, therefore, that the governing date, say, for interest, is the date given in the notice of assessment. What puzzled me was why the proper date for the payment of interest was not the date when a failure was remedied or the tax was paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, under amendment No. 46, the date on which a failure to pay tax is remedied or tax is paid would be the determining date for deciding when interest or a penalty ceases to run. The amendment was drafted to discover why the date in the notice of assessment was given higher priority than the date of remedy or payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the hon. Gentleman is that it would save an enormous amount of additional work of little benefit to anyone. If the amendment were accepted, so that the precise date had to be used rather than the date which is deemed for the purpose of the calculations, assessments would be issued and payments made, and, in accordance with the precise date, a new assessment would then have to be issued for a very small additional sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a full year at present, about 180,000 assessments are issued. If the amendment were accepted, it would result in the preparation of about the same number—at least 170,000—of additional assessments, all for very small amounts and at a cost well in excess of the extra revenue that would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
The net effect of the amendment would be bureaucratic nonsense in that there would be much additional work, whereas the return, almost certainly, would be less than the cost of that work. Any tax for which the cost of collection far exceeds the yield of the tax is not thought of highly by the House. Therefore I hope that the proposal will be similarly treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the proposal in the Bill will cause unfairness. Indeed, it is a slight protection for the traders who otherwise might be nobbled for a tiny amount of additional tax. Their annoyance can be imagined if, having paid the tax after receiving the initial assessment, traders received an extra demand for a trifling sum. I suspect that our postbags would be full of complaints-180,000 divided by 600 gives a possible 300 additional letters a year. I hope that I can persuade the Committee that we should avoid such complaints.—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear.]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that Conservative Members do not take as much pleasure as I in answering constituents' letters. It shows the difference between us. Ours are mainly letters of congratulation for our good work in opposition, but I am sure that Conservative Members are burdened with letters of complaint about the work they do in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister of State's argument in terms of convenience, though I am not entirely sure that he is right about there being additional protection for traders. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask a straightforward question about interest. When interest has been assessed on money due to the commissioners, presumably that interest is incorporated into the assessment. Can interest then be charged on the incorporated assessment so that compound interest is paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall need advice, but I do not believe that interest is compounded in that way. I am receiving nods from all directions, so I can confidently say that I am advised that interest will not be charged on the interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had been asked to raise the matter as it had caused some anxiety. I am happy with the Minister's assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister of State clear my mind [Hon. Members: "That is asking a lot."] I note that it is after the dinner hour—about some of the possible implications of subsection (3)? In subsection (3), the attributing to particular periods of global sum seems to be rather cavalier and surely creates a minefield for legal guibbling and protestation. It is clear from the wording of subsection (3) that Customs and Excise is being asked randomly to attribute a global amount throughout various periods. Therefore, if the burden of proof were on the commissioners, if challenged in court to prove those figures, they could not meet that challenge. On the basis that a person is innocent until proved guilty, there is surely a terrible danger that someone who is manifestly liable in the way in which Customs and Excise say that he is might be able to slip out of its clutches by saying that that is not the case of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
his liability. Why is the provision so drafted? Is the Minister satisfied with its legal implications and that it will be enforceable if challenged in court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that this matter is more relevant to the earlier amendment, but I am happy to respond. It is important, because if the amount is spread over a long period and surcharges or interest are payable, clearly the period to which the amount is linked is of the highest importance to the taxpayer. That is why the Bill provides that Customs and Excise will have to make that attribution. Information will not be available to be precise in all circumstances, so some attribution will be necessary, and the Department is enjoined to use its "best judgment". If the trader believes that the judgment is wrong, he can go to the VAT tribunal and so argue, and the onus will be on Customs and Excise to show that it has used "best judgment". Protection for the taxpayer is implicit in the arrangements. If the hon. Gentleman can think of a better protection, let him tell us about it, coming forward on Report with his suggestions which, of course, I will consider—or writing to me beforehand. I feel that what is being proposed is quite fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential element is that Parliament is saying to Customs and Excise, "You must use your best judgment, but, more than that, you will have to prove to a tribunal that you have used your best judgment." That seems reasonable protection for the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the taxpayer is being protected. I fear that in such cases Customs and Excise will find it difficult to prove what is clearly an arbitrary judgment on its part. I am worried that the tribunals will be clogged with rather tendentious cases of people chancing their arm, knowing full well that the likelihood is slim of the Department being able to prove admittedly arbitrary apportionments of penalty. The Exchequer will therefore suffer. I should have thought that for the financial benefit of dividing into different arbitrary periods, the Department is storing up trouble for itself. Would it not be better financially to go for the global sum rather than apportion in the way that the Minister suggests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I need repeat myself. If payment is spread over a period of years, we go for the global sum. It depends on whether the money has been owed for one year or for five years. The amounts of interest are vastly different. If I had to pay, I would rather that Customs and Excise had to use its "best judgment". I have no reason to believe that the Department will not be able to do this well, having had much experience.

I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there may be a lot of vexatious litigation, but one of the advantages of the Finance Bills' regime is that they are not the rare occasions which we hear about only once or twice a century but regular happenings each year, and if we get it wrong one year, and experience shows that changes are needed, we can seek to put it right the following year. Indeed, large chunks of each year's Finance Bill put right the mistakes or errors of judgment of our predecessors. We are not setting this in concrete for all time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments, whose purpose is to ask the Government to justify the fairly substantial period of six years during which assessments can be made by Customs and Excise. That means that if Customs and Excise decide to make an assessment six years after an accounting period, it is entitled to do so. That means that there must be a concomitant duty upon traders to keep records covering that six-year period so that Customs and Excise is able to make a proper assessment. The amendments tie in to later provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We raise the matter because we wish the Government to justify their position and for two other, specific, reasons. First the commissioners should be under as speedy and expeditious a burden as possible in discharging their duties. In principle, we would not wish the commissioners to be able to make an assessment long after an accounting period. If traders are to run their businesses in a satisfactory and efficient way, they wish to be certain of the period which the assessment covers, but a six-year period seems rather long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is difficult to see how the commissioners can make a realistic assessment unless traders retain sufficient records and information to allow them to do so. I should be grateful if the Minister would direct his mind to that matter because, if the commissioners are given the power to make an assessment covering six years, it will be meaningless unless the assessment can be judged in a proper and satisfactory way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the existing provision in relation to income tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the existing provision is six years, but I do not believe that that alters the strength of our argument. A trader who is running his business on certain lines will have to gear his trade in a particular way. If he is liable for VAT assessment after a period of six years, he will have to ensure that business is run in such a way that he is able to process any appeal against that assessment or handle matters connected with it. I hope that the Minister will elucidate that point. As the six-year period is being introduced, we wish to make sure that the Government are able to justify its introduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An unusual concept is raised in subsection (4)—the limitation to a period of 20 years an assessment raised as a result of dishonesty. That is rather more generous than in the case of income tax where, effectively, the period within which an assessment can be raised is unlimited. Will the Minister comment, briefly, on why the 20-year period has been chosen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak to amendment No. 107 in the context of the raising of late assessments following the death of the taxpayer. It strikes me that the practical effect of what the Minister proposes could be rather harsh in that he has, quite rightly in my view, followed on from income tax legislation by allowing a period of three years following death in which an assessment may be raised. However, the clause provides for a period of nine years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sort of example that we are discussing if a deceased's estate were faced with a charge of some form of dishonesty made by Customs and Excise, the executors and beneficiaries of the estate would be in a much weaker position to rebut such a charge than the taxpayer would have been had he been alive. My experience of such weak positions in relation to income tax demands has been that such assessments are often settled on the basis not of the true tax liability but on that of what the estate can afford. The only limitation as regards income tax is that on the number of years for which the Revenue can seek to justify assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that by specifying a period of nine years, the Minister of State is giving a substantial power to Customs and Excise to spread the amount of money it wants from an estate over a lengthy period. If the period were reduced to six years, as I have suggested, it would impose a slightly greater onus of proof on Customs and Excise by requiring it to show, first, that there had been dishonesty, and, secondly, the extent of that dishonesty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend's comments on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Freeman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kettering)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to air a note of caution about the clause, and perhaps I can relate it to the points made by the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there is concern among small traders about the change to a six-year period of back assessment because that, as has already been stated, is much in line with present practice. I believe that the concern is slightly different and that it relates to the frequency of control visits by inspectors. When the Minister comments on this group of amendments, I shall be grateful if he will tell the Committee whether there is to be a change of policy about the frequency of control visits which, as the Committee knows, have been running perhaps once every five years. If we move to a system of control visits every seven, eight or even nine years, that will pose a real problem in relation to the six-year period of back assessment and place a degree of strain on the operation of this group of clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would help the Committee if the Minister told us what policy relating to the frequency of control visits, if any, was likely to be pursued by Customs and Excise after the Finance Bill became law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understood the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman). Is he saying that
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
the problem with the proposed six-year period after which assessments can be made is that control visits may still be made throughout that time, so that whatever may be the period of limitation for assessments will be the period for which control visits may be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood my remarks. I am saying that if the clause is enacted, we move to a period of six years for assessment powers and the control visit frequency increases to perhaps seven or eight years, there may be embarassment and difficulty for small traders. I am merely seeking clarification of that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern), whose amendment covers the same point as mine although the period specified differs. My amendment No. 96 seeks to have three years substituted for nine years, whereas his seeks to substitute a period of six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled my amendment for substantially the same reasons as my hon. Friend tabled his, because it seems to me that recovery of part of an estate bequeathed to beneficiaries up to nine years previously is bound to cause injustice in certain circumstances. As those beneficiaries will almost certainly not have been at fault, it seems rather unfair that they should have to pay for the neglect or default of the deceased—of which they are unaware—after they dispose of benefits which they derive from the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15. p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though an estate has not been distributed within nine years—that is not as unusual as might be imagined—the beneficiaries may have planned to spend what they thought they would receive, and that could upset many people's arrangements. I feel that three years should be sufficient time for Customs and Excise to uncover a fraud in such circumstances. That is a reasonable period during which an estate might be held open for VAT purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) told us that he was probing our reasons for the six-year limit by way of an amendment to reduce it to three years. Under existing law, tax assessments may be made up to six years after the end of the accounting period involved; that is by virtue of paragraph 4(7) of schedule 7 to the VAT Act 1983. Under clause 21, instead of making complicated amendments to that provision, we are carrying forward and broadening the provisions slightly. The six-year limit remains the same; we are conferring no additional power. Indeed, the existing law is restated in clause 21(1), to produce coherent legislation. For example, schedule 7 to this Bill interacts with schedule 7 of the principal Act. I realise that it is confusing to talk about two schedule 7s. Nevertheless, the requirement for a six-year assessment is unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, six years is a well-established period. It is the VAT limit and the direct tax limit, and the Keith committee came out firmly in favour of maintaining it. Again, it is the retention period for records under section 12(9) of the Companies Act 1976 and the limitation period for contract debts in the Statute of Limitations. In other words, the six-year period has a lot going for it. We should maintain it in these circumstances. The Keith committee recommended that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
records should be kept for six years, which is new; however, I believe that it should be a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) spoke about the number of control visits that are made. Certainly, they occur at less frequent intervals than three years and occasionally exceed the six-year period. However, Customs and Excise now directs control visits, using computer information, and tries to ensure that the most efficient use is made of personnel—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cowboys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>—absolutely—rather than regarding matters as routine, with those who are compliant and those who are non-compliant being treated in the same way. The exercise of judgment by Customs and Excise in this respect is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) suggested that the nine-year period associated with death and possible fraud connected with it was a bit onerous. I sympathise with what he said, but I am advised that the simplicity of his amendment, which substitutes six years for nine, is too good to be true. I take the spirit of his amendment and shall come back on Report. I am advised that it requires a little more jiggling to be in tune with the Keith recommendations yet take account of the fair points raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, North-West and for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the median position. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton offers three years, the Bill says nine and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West says six. I shall try to centre around six.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 20-year period for fraud has been referred to. At present Customs and Excise can, with the permission of the VAT tribunal—I am told that the technical term is an ex parte judgment—go back any length of time. With VAT it is a little hard to go back more than 13 years as VAT started only in 1973, but we are legislating not for a year or two but for some time ahead. The Keith committee proposed a 20-year period during which fraud and the other acts in the schedule could be investigated, but that was to be an absolute limit. The Customs were not to go back further in any circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the pattern of years that I describe seems reasonable and fair to the Committee and that the amendments will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has picked six years and the amendment seeks three years. The Customs and Excise must have information about the incidence of assessment of accounts up to six years. The Customs and Excise might have made a case for an increase to more than six years by drawing the Minister's attention to cases where it had been unable to raise assessments. Is that information available and has the Minister brought it to the Committee today? Perhaps his officials can pass him a note suggesting, say, that last year 1,000 cases were lost because they fell outside the six-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help by giving the figure for between three and six years. About £20 million a year is involved. If the period were reduced to three years, that would be the sort of figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look at the figure for over six years and write to the hon. Gentleman because I do not have advice
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
about the amounts involved. I believe that they are quite small. The Keith committee looked at this matter and came down firmly on six years as a reasonable and proper period unless fraud or something akin to it were involved. Then the Keith Committee suggested going back 20 years and I am sure that Members will agree that the six-year limit should not apply for such offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but Keith's criterion might not have been that of Parliament. It might be the judgment of Parliament that there were enough cases over six years to require a change in legislation to nine years. Surely information about the number of cases in excess of six years is relevant to the Committee. We might be talking about a substantial amount of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the Customs and Excise put it to the Minister and that the Minister put it to the Committee that there was the potential for claiming an additional £20 million by increasing the period from six to eight years. The majority of members of the Committee might judge that we should legislate accordingly. However, we are being denied the information because the Minister does not have it at his disposal today. Perhaps when he deals with VAT on Report—or, indeed, later in today's proceedings—he would care to give us the figure so that we can consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not stopping the Committee from considering the matter; it is the rules of order that prevent us. There is no amendment before us that would increase the period from six years to eight. If such an amendment stood on the amendment paper, I should be prepared to deal with it, and if we return to the matter on Report, I shall ensure that I am briefed as well as possible to meet the point then. I am not preventing a discussion tonight. Our only options tonight are to choose between six years and three or not to proceed with the provision at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to have taken Keith as an indication of what should be done. That being so, will he agree to consider the amount of money that could be raised were the period increased to more than six years, and to table a sensible amendment on Report should he find that necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that I shall consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Randall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that what was new in the clause was that records would be neatly kept for six years, and that that had emanated from the Keith report. I accept that the logic of the six-year period seems realistic because it fits in with everything else. However, one has to relate that to the number of fraud cases that one could uncover. Substantial benefit could arise from that, and I am glad that we shall have the opportunity to consider the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry is that we are constantly being told that small businesses have great difficulty in coping with the paperwork, appeal procedures and so on associated with VAT. I wonder to what extent the Minister has consulted the small firms associations to establish whether they are concerned about the onerous task of retaining the records. I know that much use is made of computers these days, but many small businesses are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
unsophisticated and do not keep very good records. The clause could add substantially to their overheads, and may produce a lot of screams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that most wise and responsible small companies already keep their records for at least six years? Indeed, if the Customs and Excise were targeting on companies for control visits I should be inclined to advise them to visit companies that did not retain their records for six years, because that would be an indication of those companies' general approach to accounting matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister of State for the way in which he dealt with my comments on the nine-year limit and I look forward to hearing his further comments on the matter. May I also encourage him to reconsider the 20-year limit? It seems to me a pity that fraud against the Customs and Excise should be treated more generously than fraud against the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have little doubt that the 20-year period will be looked at by my colleagues who are responsible for Inland Revenue matters. I am not sure what the Keith committee said about it, but we shall bear the matter in mind. As I said, we hope to legislate next year for the direct taxation part of the Keith report. In doing so, we shall not seek a slavish identity between the Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue provisions because, as my right honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in the foreword to the document that was circulated in November, different circumstances apply in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where it is appropriate to have similar times and rates of interest, we shall have them, and no doubt if the Government did not do so, members of this Committee next year would seek to persuade us to have them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to what the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said about the keeping of records, may I point out that it is the making of records that presents the problem for businesses—not stashing them away in a filing cabinet or a shoe box. The hon. Member was right to say that we should keep an eye on companies that are not keeping records, although now, of course, there will be a legal requirement on them to keep records for six years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content to accept what the Minister says, and he is right to draw attention to the fact that at present it is a six-year period. As new powers and new penalties are being introduced, I thought it right for the Government to justify their position. When the Minister writes to my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) setting out the information, perhaps he would be good enough to make it available to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) to move the next amendment, may I draw hon. Members' attention to the first line of the amendment, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If an appeal is made under the previous sub-section and in an appeal against it"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
The Chair and the hon. Member realise that that does not make sense. The first "appeal" is a genuine mistake, not a printer's error. The Chair has decided to announce it in this way, accepting the change of the word "appeal" to the word "assessment", so that the sentence makes sense. The order in which I have accepted it removes from the hon. Member the responsibility to explain his position, because technically he would be moving an amendment to an amendment. So the Chair has accepted the change in the wording, and the line will now read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If an assessment is made under the previous sub-section and in an appeal against it".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 24, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) If an assessment is made under the previous sub-section and in an appeal against it it is shown that tax had not been lost as specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of that sub-section, the assessment shall be cancelled and any tax paid under it shall be repaid".</p></blockquote>
It may appear that I am barking up the wrong tree, but perhaps for a different reason from the one that I shall adumbrate. I hope that the ambiguity that I perceive in subsection (4) does not exist, and that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to assure me about the Department's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 21 lays down a general time limit for making assessments—six years in the case of VAT. That period is extended by subsection (4) to 20 years if the commissioners have reasonable grounds for believing that tax has, or may have, been lost in certain specified circumstances set out in paragraphs (a) and (b)—basically, when certain VAT offences have been committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an appeal against such an assessment, the taxpayer should be entitled to have his assessment discharged if he can prove that no tax was lost as a result of the conditions laid down in paragraphs (a) and (b). It may be impossible for him to prove that no tax was lost for any extraneous reason, but it is not clear from the present wording of the subsection whether the assessment that the commissioners made would be discharged. As a result, an assessment made beyond the six-year period could remain in being under subsection (4), whereas under the other parts of the clause an assessment could not be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such an assessment is made and the taxpayer can prove that the conditions laid down in subsection (4) do not give rise to any loss of tax—even though he cannot prove that another default or neglect cannot be laid at his door—I should like an assurance that the assessment will be discharged. I should also like an assurance that the reasonable grounds mentioned in that subsection are not restricted to those existing when the assessment is made. The amendment would clarify that. If the taxpayer can prove that those conditions do not give rise to loss of tax, the extended 20-year period should not apply to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I wholly follow my hon. Friend's argument. Indeed, until you clarified it, Mr. Leadbitter, my hon. Friend's amendment was a trifle obscure. I was advised that the effect of the amendment would be to ensure that where a trader successfully appealed against the grounds that justified the 20-year time limit, the assessment should be cancelled and the tax repaid. I assure my hon. Friend that that will be so. It is covered by clause 24(1) which amends section 40 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
to allow appeals against the making of extended period assessments issued under clause 21(4). If such an appeal were successful, the assessment would, of course, be withdrawn as a matter of normal practice and any tax deposited would be repaid with interest under the other current provisions of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule contains perhaps the most important of the VAT provisions. It refers to the enforcement of VAT powers. The trader is often worried not so much about the VAT powers, but about the manner in which they are exercised. Therefore, we should scrutinise carefully the powers given to Customs and Excise in this schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment which can probably be dealt with quickly. Paragraph 1(2) will change paragraph 4(6) of schedule 7 to the VAT Act 1983. It deals with a case of an importer or another person who has goods in his possession. It gives Customs and Excise power to require the trader to prove either that the goods have not been sold or that they have been lost or destroyed. If he cannot provide such proof, Customs can levy an assessment on the basis that he has sold the goods and not accounted for the.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that paragraph 1(2) of schedule 7 provides that if the trader can show that the goods have been exported from the United Kingdom other than by way of supply, an assessment cannot be deemed upon him. If that is so, I shall not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"but that amount must still be based on a proper assessment by the Commissioners of the tax due.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to amend the new subparagraph 1(3) which deals with the circumstances arising from a taxpayer failing to make a return within a prescribed accounting period. In such a case, the commissioners make an assessment, and there is thereafter a further
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
failure in that no proper return is made for the period for which the assessment has been made. Thus, after a failure to make a return, an assessment is made; there is still no payment, and so another assessment is made. Subparagraph 1(3) gives the commissioners power to specify in the second assessment an amount of tax greater than they would otherwise have considered appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cause of my anxiety about the provision is simple. The nature of an assessment is that it is a general calculation made by the commissioners of the amount of tax properly due. Used in its strict sense, an assessment is not a penalty. What worries me is that the commissioners, under the guise of making a further assessment, are really being given a power to levy a penalty. For that reason, the amendment seeks to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"that amount"—</p></blockquote>
the second assessment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"must still be based on a proper assessment by the commissioners of the tax due".</p></blockquote>
We are trying to flush out the Government's intentions. It seems wrong that they should be introducing by a back door a further power to allow the commissioners to impose a penalty, yet I can see no other explanation of the words in the schedule, which provides that the commissioners may specify
	<br><blockquote><p>"an amount of tax greater than that which they would otherwise have considered to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister clarify those words? If I have understood the provision, it is introducing an additional penalty so that the commissioners can state an amount of tax over and above a proper assessment, by reference to what they regard as the misconduct of the taxpayer. It is unacceptable that a penalty should be introduced in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the procedures covered by the clause are a little difficult to understand and may at first sight appear to have the effects that the hon. Gentleman fears. I hope that I can reassure him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the increased assessments that can be made under the Bill are made on the basis of the commissioners' best judgment. Paragraph 4(1) of schedule 7 to the principal Act empowers the commissioners to assess the amount of tax due
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the best of their judgment"</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 1 of schedule 7 to this Bill does not remove that requirement, but amends it in the light of the Keith report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Keith argued that "best judgment" in these circumstances requires that the Customs and Excise should issue higher assessments wherever appropriate where there is a repeated failure to furnish a VAT return, but previous assessments have been paid.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an assessment is sent to a trader who is not making his returns and he pays it and he continues to do that without ever making a return, there is at least a prima facie indication that the trader reckons that the assessment is less than he ought to pay. In such situations, the commissioners are provided with the vires in excercising that judgment to take into account the likelihood that the previoius assessment was paid because it was sig-

nificantly below the true amount of tax due from the trader. The amendment would not effectively change paragraph 1. Its legal effects would not alter the existing situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inflated assessment procedure is instigated only for a trader who in two out of the four previous accounting periods has paid assessments not subsequently replaced by returns. Initially, the assessment would be inflated by 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is that apparent in the proposed paragraph (6A)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is confusing to be dealing with the provisions in the principal Act as well as those in Schedule 7 to this Bill and I must act on advice from the experts. I acknowledge my inadequacy in understanding the legal drafting of the paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that both the legal provisions and the way in which the Commissioners will exercise that power means that the procedure would be instigated only for a trader who in two out of the four previous accounting periods had paid assessments not subsequently replaced by returns. Initially the assessment would be inflated by 20 per cent and subsequent assessments would be inflated by an additional 20 per cent on each occasion that an assessment was generated until the trader rendered a return or the assessment had been inflated by 100 per cent. If a return were rendered, inflation of the next assessment would be by the minimum inflation factor of 20 per cent. Inflation of assessments would be discontinued when returns had been rendered for four previous periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rendering of returns is a requirement. We are talking about a trader not meeting his legal obligation. Inflated assessments are one of the additional pressure points. If the assessments were too high, there would be no problem as the trader—the individual or the firm—would produce the right return and send it in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get this clear. Is the Minister saying that increasing the assessment by an inflation factor of 20 per cent is contained in an Act?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the vires is contained within the clauses and the schedule that we are now debating. The power is partly used at present. It was reflected upon and commented upon by Keith and what is proposed is another pressure on the non-complying trader.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has experience in these matters, he will know that if assessment is being paid continually without returns being made, it is a fair indication that the amount being collected is too low. In that case, how does one pressure the trader to produce the assessment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have default.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have that, but we also have these provisions. Keith recommended that these provisions should be used. I shall certainly consider the hon. Gentleman's point about unfairness. The honest trader who makes accurate returns on time has nothing to fear from these provisions. However, the person who accepts the assessments and acknowledges that they are less than the tax that he should be paying will find himself being squeezed as a result of the powers that we are giving to Customs and Excise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole tenor of the Government's proposals is that an incentive should be created whereby traders feel required to submit returns. We are considering traders who are in arrears. The Minister's view of why they would accept assessments is little different from mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to secure an arrangement whereby traders can be made to make assessments. I wonder whether the Minister has thought of another way. The likelihood is that those collectors of value-added tax, who are in arrears are more likely to be keeping inaccurate records. Instead of placing the emphasis on them to collect when they are in arrears, should we not place the emphasis on departmental officials, at a charge to the client, to carry out that function? That means that departmental officials would be responsible for collating the material which makes up a three-monthly account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman agree that the taxpayer in arrears is not necessarily the one in most trouble? More often it is the trader who has difficulty in collecting the tax from his customers as a result of late payment. Would not an official be of assistance in explaining the regulations on invoicing to such a trader?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know which is the greater. The hon. Gentleman may be right and I may be right. I am talking about the group which I believe exists. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will speak about that group to which he refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise is able to employ officers to carry out that work, which would entail a collation of all the creditor's invoices—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House. </i></p>
	<p>10.25 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the principle of a change in emphasis from an incentive system, with collectors being required to collect taxes, as against the principle of officers being appointed by Customs and Excise to carry out that function, and to do so only where an assessment, or the conditions that now apply to assessment, might exist. The principle would be simple; they would collate invoices for goods dispatched and also those that would otherwise appear on purchase ledgers, calculate the VAT and charge the client.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that that implies an increase in the number of civil servants. But the whole exercise could be self-financing on the basis that costs charged to the client cover the cost of the work. In that system there would be an incentive for people likely to go into arrears, within the context of arrangements discussed in the Bill, because they would consider it inappropriate for Customs and Excise officers to be mauling over their accounts in such a way. Surely that is the best incentive of all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what I said before is correct, as against the intervention from the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern), it is more likely that these people will be clients, customers, collectors who need that intervention by Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that as a principle to the Minister because I know that his general view, particularly wearing his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
cap as Minister responsible for the Civil Service, is to see a reduction in the number of civil servants. But there comes a time when we should adopt a responsible approach to such matters and see things not simply in terms of numbers but in terms of effectively collecting revenue. Indeed, in the case that I put to the Committee today, I was perhaps hoping commercially to educate collectors of revenue for Customs and Excise in the way in which they should carry out those functions themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Minister to think again about whether to accept the amendment. I shall say by way of preface that we must be extremely careful in considering such enforcement powers, which are pretty wide and general, to ensure that we do not end up by saying that honest traders will comply and therefore we should not worry about the draconian nature of any powers of enforcement or penalties. Of course honest traders will comply and everyone should comply, but it is a non sequitur to say that we should not ensure that there are sufficient provisions, not for dishonest traders, to ensure that mistakes or hardship do not occur as a result of the legislation that we are introducing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A clear delineation must be made of the powers of the commissioners. If the power of commissioners on a second assessment is to estimate a further amount because it is likely that the first assessment was understated, I accept that. That would be fine. But if the suggestion is that because the first assessment is likely to have been underestimated, traders should be stimulated by hammering them on the second assessment, the nature of the second assessment is changed. It is no longer a proper assessment but a penalty. That would be quite wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly alarmed by some of the Minister's remarks. I am well aware from the Keith report that 78 per cent of the second assessments indicated on subsequent verification that the first assessment had understated the correct liability of the trader by more than 5 per cent. But I would be a little alarmed if Customs and Excise applied absolute rules in those circumstances and said, "Whenever there is to be a second assessment, you will up it by 20 per cent, 30 per cent or whatever." From an administrative point of view, that would be extremely questionable. The proper duty of the commissioners should surely be to consider what they thought the understatement on the first assessment had been. To apply a blanket provision would be to introduce, in effect, an automatic surcharge by the back door. That is what concerns me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unclear from the drafting of new sub-paragraph (6A) whether the commissioners make the greater assessment by reference to the understatement of the first assessment, or by way of penalty. Our amendment seeks to make the matter absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that the amendment is otiose. I ask the Minister to reconsider it and if he agrees that it is not otiose, it should be implemented. If the Minister agrees to reconsider the matter, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment. We should not allow what are, in effect, additional surcharges or penalties to be introduced in this way, tucked away in a paragraph of
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
a schedule to an Act. I make that point as a comment on the way in which we introduce legislation in the House, as well as for its own sake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How could I not respond positively to such a reasonable appeal? I am advised that the words are otiose. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the proposition is perhaps not entirely self-evident to the layman and it would therefore be right for me to take up the hon. Gentleman's invitation and consider the matter with officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We certainly do not want to cause hardship to the traders concerned. We want to ensure that traders who take advantage of assessments which have been issued in good faith and with good judgment but are way below the amount of tax which they should pay do not get away with it for a long time. I do not think that there is much difference between the views of the Government and the Opposition on that. I shall certainly reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 52, in page 109, line 33, leave out paragraph 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise is entitled to make an assessment going back over a period of six years, as it has always been, and that is stated again in the Bill. None the less and somewhat curiously, perhaps, the obligation to retain records was limited to three years, not six years, under the 1983 Act. The purpose of paragraph 2 of schedule 7 of the Bill is to substitute six years for the present requirement of three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment to canvass the Minister of State so that he would tell us why the period must be increased to six years. Although I realise that the difficulty about records is often in their creation not in storing or keeping them, it can be an administrative burden to retain records for a long time. It should be remembered, too, that for some small traders VAT records may be on tiny pieces of paper but there may be many of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest in that I have kept VAT records myself and I know how difficult it is to keep records in a comprehensive form. For the records to be retained for six years puts a big administrative burden on businesses. I shall not elaborate further. The Minister of State understands our argument. We merely ask him to justify the extension of the period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy once more to embarrass the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) by agreeing with him. The reason records had to be kept for three years was that it was originally intended—when the legislation was framed in 1973—that control visits should be carried out once every three years. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) said, the original intention has not been adhered to, so control visits take place at infrequent intervals, which is a problem in itself and has created the further problems which have been referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Sedgefield that the extention to six years could cause considerable difficulties for some types of firm, although for many keeping records for that long will not be any more difficult than keeping them for three years. Probably
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
even the busiest member of the Bar would not regard it as an onerous responsibility to keep records for six years, but that might not be so in many other instances. We should remember that not only ledgers, but sales and purchase invoices and the supporting documentation ought to be kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) said that a prudent trader would keep his records for six years because of other obligations in the Value Added Tax Act 1983. I agree, but the extension seems otiose for some types of firm, especially as we are trying to reduce the regulatory burden upon businesses. Moreover, the White Paper on administrative burdens on business that was issued recently has a large section on the burden of VAT on traders. I am surprised that we should seek to compound the errors that have arisen during the past 12 years because of the inadequacy of control visits with its consequent uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I believe that the extention to six years in unreasonable. I hope that my hon. Friend will think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish modestly to question the able way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) put his case. My hon. Friend said that it was a probing amendment and he asked the Minister of State to tell the Committee why he believed that the reform would be in the interests of VAT reform. I am sure that my hon. Friend will listen intently to the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish slightly to dissent from the view expressed by my hon. Friend. I do so only because of personal experience. I am not one of those hon. Members who agree with the silly case that is always made by outside lobbies that too much paper work is imposed on business. I have never agreed with that principle. People take advantage of it; it has become a sort of political football to talk about mountains of bumf coming through the post. An objective assessment of the amount of paper received in a business would show that it is not preponderous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was last in business when a Labour Government were in power, and people might think that paper work was preponderent then. I am told that these days there is less. If that is so, there must be almost nothing. I suggest that we are going a little far if we say that businesses are being put at a disadvantage or being required to retain too much documentation. We are talking of a small company with perhaps a few files—not a voluminous amount. If anything, it helps internal accounting and costing. A manufacturer especially is always referring back to records, whether to assess costs in previous years or to discover what was paid for a raw material and what it was selling for on the market. I was always looking back to see what my tax arrears were because I was once in arrears with VAT, as most traders are. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] These are not huge sums. Anyone can slip into arrears by a few weeks. Many people are behind. It is a question of how far one pushes it and whether one takes advantage. We did not do so, but occasionally we slipped into arrears. It is the way the system works. Perhaps that is incidental. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is eight or nine years ago, and I was never subject to an assessment, as is the case with many people in arrears. They deal with these matters responsibly, and Customs and Excise adopts a flexible
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
approach in its working relationship with its better clients—as we were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise is aware of the problems in business, especially in smaller companies. It understands the difficulties. I always found it more than willing to show flexibility, and it never exerted pressure on me or on anyone I know. The only people who had pressure put upon them were the rogues and the cowboys—and they deserved it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering whether companies should be required to hold a little more paper work. It is almost incidental and will have little bearing on a business. In healthy business and commercial practice, it is in a company's best interests to retain that paper work for all sorts of reasons apart from Customs and Excise inspection. I hope that the Minister does not lift it to six years. I should like it to be extended substantially to 12, perhaps 18, or even 20 years. Indeed, in an age of permanent computerisation, there is an argument for permanent records of company information being kept on monitor or microfiche so that the excise has access, way into the future, to the past records of companies. There is nothing to be hidden. We are talking only of space, and if most companies consider this objectively, they will realise that it is in their best interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Yeo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Suffolk, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the concern expressed about the burden that this measure places on small traders. After hearing the comments of the hon. Member for Workington, (Mr. Campbell-Savours), I question whether he is familiar with the activities of small businesses for which the keeping of records for 12 or 15 years would be an appalling requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, six years is not such an onerous requirement for large businesses. The amendment highlights the absurdity of requiring traders whose turnover is as low as £20,000 a year to register for VAT. My anxiety about the provision would fall away if the turnover threshold was substantially higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is too narrow to cover my hon. Friend's point. I shall put his comments about the threshold on one side, although the Government are aware of his views. We went round the three or six-year course in our discussions on clause 21. The requirement in schedule 7 flows entirely from the recommendations made by the Keith report in paragraph 32.21, and is in line with those recommendations. Traders who find it onerous to keep full records for six years should discuss the matter with their local VAT office, which may be able to offer guidance on the primary items which should be retained. Many of the ancillary bits of paper could be disposed of. I can assure the hon. Member for Workingdon (Mr. Campbell-Savours) that the local VAT office will give guidance about the use of modern technology and the kinds of records which should be stored either on computer or microfiche. I agree with him that over a period of years, such records will expand a great deal within the business and commercial community. It might be useful, too, to make it clear that the provisions are not retrospective. The requirement for the six-year keeping of records will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
begin to build up from the operative date or from Royal Assent, whichever is the later. I hope that, in view of those comments, the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments' purpose is to explore the Government's case. The Opposition must explore their case, or the measures will go through on the nod. The Minister has given us one explanation. It may be that businesses should keep records for six years or for longer, but the present distinction to be made is that between good business and the legal obligation which it is proper to require.

I take the Minister's assurance on board. The period of six years has such symmetry within this legislation that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Certain courts may imply a duty to exercise those powers in a reasonable way in any event, but I believe that it is right to make it clear, because the constraint of reasonableness is applied in different parts of the paragraph. For example in paragraph 3 of schedule 7, new paragraphs (2)(b)(i) and (ii) include the power to require the constraint of reasonableness.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 110, line 37, leave out "as soon as practicable" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"prior to removal, unless it is not practicable to do so."</p></blockquote>
In the spirit of unity that has broken out in the Committee, which is perhaps a reflection of the accretion towards the centre in the Conservative party, I advise hon. Members that the amendment seeks to provide not exactly a safeguard but a facility for traders in circumstances when Customs and Excise officers remove a document in pursuance of an investigation. The proposed new paragraph (4C) in schedule 7(3) states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a document removed by an authorised person … is reasonably required for the proper conduct of a business he shall, as soon as practicable, provide a copy of the document, free of charge, to the person by whom it was produced or caused to be produced."</p></blockquote>
It may be that this cannot be done in a reasonable way, but if it were possible it should be done. Proposed new paragraph (4C) deals with a document that is necessary for the proper conduct of a business, and one assumes that such a document would be of some importance. The only obligation on the "authorised person" is to provide a new copy of that document "as soon as practicable". That means that a document might be removed from the premises of a trader, and his only entitlement would be to receive a copy of it in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether it is possible to ensure that, in circumstances in which it is practicable to do so, the trader is provided with a copy of that document before it is removed from his premises. That would allow Customs and Excise to have use of the document for the purposes of its investigation and also allow the trader to have use of it for the proper conduct of his business. I appreciate that there may be drafting difficulties with my amendment, but its spirit should be reasonably clear and, if it were possible to move along those lines, it would allow Customs and Excise to process its investigation while giving the necessary protection to small traders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the words proposed in the amendment would lead to difficulties. The intention, of course, is that when a VAT officer making his visit wishes to remove a document—which I understand happens in only about one case in 40—a copy will be provided as soon as practicable. A photocopy can often be made on the premises with no problem at all. However, that might not be possible in certain circumstances. Surely, in the present state of technology, no one would expect an inspector to carry round with him a portable photocopier—although of course such equipment may soon exist. I am sure that we are all agreed that copies should be provided as soon as possible and that, if practicable, that should be done on the premises. I feel that the wording of the schedule is in tune with the Keith committee recommendations. Having accepted the previous amendment, I shall now revert to form and advise the Committee not to accept amendment No. 55, which I hope will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"unless it is not practicable to do so".</p></blockquote>
If there is no photocopier on the premises, clearly it would not be practicable for a copy to be provided prior to the removal of the documents. But if one is available, the trader should be allowed to have a copy of the document that he needs to carry out his business. Again, perhaps the Minister would consider giving a right to the trader to take a copy of the document before it is removed, so that he can be adequately protected in the running of his business. I am trying to provide for what I hope are the infrequent circumstances when Customs and Excise act in an overbearing manner, and to protect as far as possible the proper administration of a trader's business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared to reconsider the wording. At present, there is a mandatory requirement to produce the copy as soon as practicable. I really cannot see how that could be improved upon; it is a tough requirement. If the VAT officer did not behave sensibly in this respect, there would be due cause for complaint. As the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) said, there is nothing between us about what we want to see achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 113, line 33, leave out from beginning to "or" in line 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of some importance, again related to the procedure for removing documents. The purpose of proposed new paragraph 10B(7) of schedule 7(6) is that there shall be no duty to grant access to or supply a copy of a document that has been removed if the officer in charge of the investigation has reasonable ground for believing that it will prejudice either the investigation in which he is engaged or—which is more doubtful—the investigation of another offence. He has power to refuse access to a document or to a copy of a document if that might prejudice his investigation or another case. I am worried about the addition of the power to prevent access for the investigation of an offence other than that which the officer is investigating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister several questions. First, I assume that the other offence would have to be a Customs and Excise offence and that it could not be any criminal offence that might prejudice the case. I also assume that the officer's role would be purely that of a Customs and Excise official and that he would have no other guise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, why is it necessary to include such a power and to allow an officer to refuse access for an offence
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
other than that which he is investigating? The officer is being given a serious and wide-ranging power and we should know why we are including it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this is an important aspect of the changes being made and it deserves comment in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to repeat the long discussion in Committee on the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, where the same points were raised. We seek to make this power in tune with that in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It is easy to envisage instances where material lawfully seized during a search under a VAT warrant as evidence of one fraud disclosed evidence of other Customs and Excise offences—for example offences on duties, agricultural levies, import licences or other excise evasion. The range of possibilities is considerable. The documents might reveal other crimes such as theft or forgery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that evidence should be retained along the precise lines of the precedent established in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It would not be right to go back on that legislation. We might make it easier for someone against whom there was a case of guilt on wider offences to destroy evidence. He might get away with a crime for which the Customs and Excise officers had found evidence when they were investigating another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly concerned because I see a distinction between the power given under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the powers given to Customs and Excise officers. As I understand the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, for the first time a police officer is given power to retain documentation or evidence not merely for a crime that he is investigating but for any other crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Police officers have a general duty to investigate all crimes, but we are dealing with the powers of Customs and Excise officers. I understand why Customs and Excise officers may wish to investigate Customs and Excise offences other than those for which their investigation is being conducted. For example, evidence about a Customs and Excise fraud may appear relevant to the investigation of an importation problem. That would fall within the ambit of the duties of a Customs and Excise officer and I understand that it would be right for the investigation—in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act—to cover those matters. However, I find it difficult to accept that a Customs and Excise officer should have the power to retain documents relating to the investigation of criminal offences in relation to which he has no powers or duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise officers do not have the same powers as the police. It is one thing for them to investigate matters that fall within their duties; it is quite another for them to be allowed to retain documents on the ground that they may be relevant to crimes that are properly police matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a general public duty on Customs and Excise officials—as on any public servant in this matter. If they come across clear evidence that a crime has been committed they should not pass that evidence back so as to prejudice the investigation that should properly follow. I do not disagree that this is an important point. I do not think that such cases will arise frequently, but I can envisage VAT documents
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
producing evidence of, for example, a drug offence. In such circumstances, the public would view askance a failure on our part to say that the Customs and Excise officers should retain that evidence, especially if they judged that by returning it they would prejudice an investigation into what could be a serious offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not giving the Customs and Excise an undue or unreasonable power. We are saying that if by chance the proper investigation of a VAT offence reveals evidence of other Customs and Excise or criminal offences, they should not be forced to return the documents so as to prejudice further investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable that the Customs and Excise should be given that power, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's argument but I am still slightly troubled. Is sub-paragraph (7) intended simply to lay down what is already the public duty of a civil servant, or does it go beyond that? If civil servants had a public duty to act in the way described by the Minister, surely they would already have the power to do so and there would be no need for sub-paragraph (7). However, if that provision is not so much an adjunct to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act as an attempt to put into a form of statutory words an existing public duty, I am prepared to accept it. I thought it right to probe the Minister on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the provision is a judicious blend of the two. But I shall look at it again in the light of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and I hope that he will be prepared to withdraw the amendment on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That this schedule, as amended, be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me remind the Minister of a comment made by the Chief Secretary at a previous sitting. He told the Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where we have diverged from the recommendations of the Keith committee we have done so to be a little more sensitive to the interests of taxpayers. "—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 16 May 1985; c. 122.]</p></blockquote>
I want to raise several issues with the Minister in the hope that he will explain the thinking that underlies schedule 7. Moreover, some of the Keith recommendations do not appear here, and we should like to know the reason for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first issue I want to raise relates to paragraph 3, in which powers are given to the Customs and Excise to obtain documents and evidence. The Keith committee talked about the need for professional privilege for solicitors, and the need to extend it to qualified accountants and members of the Institute of Taxation. I have no desire to bolster the already handsome earnings of those professional people, but we need to protect the free and frank exchange between taxpayers and their professional advisers whether lawyers, accountants or members of the Institute of Taxation. So the concept of professional privilege makes sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
The second issue relates to paragraph 5 dealing with search warrants. The Keith committee said that as much information as was practicable should be involved in the search warrant. The Bill has no such provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee also recommended that warrants should be issued by circuit judges, not by magistrates. I understand that the Treasury's reason for not restricting the power to circuit judges is one of administrative convenience. Perhaps the Minister can tell us why administrative convenience outweighs the more powerful check of recourse to a circuit judge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) was right to raise the issue of legal privilege. I can assure the Committee that—as is set out in paragraph 63 of the consultative document—until the Government reach a decision on the remaining privilege recommendations of the Keith committee, and any necessary legislation has been enacted, Customs and Excise will respect any reasonable claim to legal professional privilege in relation to the VAT services power proposed in paragraph 3 of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that formal ministerial assurance as an indication of what will happen. As he knows, matters concerning professional privilege are still under consideration, and I think that there will be a link with the Revenue in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about search warrants in paragraph 5. The Keith committee accepted that there was no evidence that VAT warrants were being sought or issued irresponsibly. On the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, Ministers argued that magistrates were fully competent to deal with applications for police search warrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Raising authorisation to circuit judge level, as recommended by Keith, would increase the burden on the judiciary without materially strengthening the safeguards for the taxpayer. The Chancellor specifically referred to this issue in his foreword to the consultative document, and we considered the matter carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Keith thought that the Customs should go to a circuit judge to get authority for the warrant, and a similar issue was considered in the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill. The advice I received is that that would not materially strengthen the safeguards for the taxpayer, but would impose a heavier burden on the judiciary, to no good effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to follow the practice established in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Therefore, the normal procedure for obtaining a warrant by going to magistrates will apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, schedule 7 is important because it gives the teeth to the Customs and Excise powers. We have achieved a certain amount in discussing the subject, particularly the Minister's acceptance of an amendment and his agreement to reconsider amendments Nos. 51 and 55. I am sure that he will also take account of the important points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suggested earlier today and last Thursday, following the persuasive arguments of the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd), it seems right for me to advise the Committee that clause 23 should not stand part of the Bill. Therefore, the power of mitigation in that clause would not be available to Customs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite exceptionally, and under terms of the Public Accounts Committee, the Customs and Excise, like the Inland Revenue, has extra-statutory powers which could be used in a very compassionate case. That has to be reported to the PAC and it is invigilated by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The whole thing is out in the open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his kind remarks and I am pleased that he has pursued that line.

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENTS OF SECTION 40 OF THE PRINCIPLE ACT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 25, line 29, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment follows from the powers conferred on appeals under section 40 of the principal Act. There is a limitation on the right of appeal because proposed subsection (1A) disallows the tribunal any power to vary an amount assessed by way of penalty, interest or surcharge, except in so far as it is necessary to reduce it to the amount appropriate under sections 12 to 18 of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amdendment seeks to discover from the Minister why it is necessary to limit the powers of appeal in this way. It is difficult to see why the tribunal has no power to vary the amount of the assessment, and why the assessment should not form part of the appealable process. One would have expected that a VAT tribunal would have the broadest possible scope in determining appeals from Customs and Excise. The amount of assessment, made by way of penalty, surcharge or interest, is extremely important. That is what the trader cares about, because that is the amount that he is being asked to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the power of the VAT tribunal on appeal is being limited to what lawyers would describe as one not to review the merits of the original decision, but simply to decide whether the decision was exercised properly. The tribunal would not be entitled to go back and inquire why the assessment had been made in a particular way, but only whether the assessment was correctly or incorrectly made. That seems to be a procedural rather than a substantive point. Perhaps I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
misunderstood the clause, and perhaps a VAT tribunal is entitled to say that the amount of the assessment is wrong. However, I take the words in subsection 24(2), providing that the tribunal is denied
	<br><blockquote><p>"any power to vary an amount assessed",</p></blockquote>
to mean that it is not entitled to say that commissioners have got their sums wrong and that it is therefore not entitled to substitute a proper assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that as a limitation on the right of appeal which I should like to hear the Minister explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It follows from last week's debate, which was reflected in my advice to the Committee that clause 23 should not stand part of the Bill, that neither Customs and Excise, nor the tribunal should have power to mitigate the penalties. Under the original Keith proposals, the VAT tribunal would have had neither the power to vary the penalty nor the power to judge whether it should be incurred because the taxpayer had behaved with due diligence and had reasonable excuse. As a result of representations we have inserted into the Bill a power for the tribunal to say that due diligence had been exercised, that there was reasonable excuse and that therefore no penalties of any kind should apply. That is an extremely important additional safeguard, introduced as a result of representations, and I think welcome to all parts of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the amendment now proposes is that the tribunal should also have power to vary the amount of the penalty. That strikes at the heart of the Keith philosophy of fixed penalties, providing certainty. It also strikes at the basis on which I made the concession, welcomed by the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd), that the power of mitigation should not be available to the commissioners, nor to the VAT tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have I understood the Minister correctly? If the commissioners get the amount of money wrong, why should not the VAT tribunal be empowered to vary it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the question at issue is one of the amount of VAT, of course that can be reviewed. Clause 23 contained a mitigating power, allowing the commissioners to say, "The penalty ought to be f x; that is what is laid down. But we will reduce it to £½x." We have removed that power from the Commissioners, and we do not believe that it should be available to the VAT tribunal. If there were a dispute over the calculations, for example, that would be perfectly proper and could go before the tribunals. The provisions of the clauses allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the procedural manner in which we dealt with clause 23, it was difficult to respond to what the Minister of State had to say about it. So I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Leadbitter, if I revert to clause 23. Clause 24 is linked with it and I am not sure that we have done the right thing by not including clause 23 in the Bill, although it was pressed upon the Minister by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In chapter 18.4.41 the Keith committee recommended that
	<ol>
	<li>"Customs and Excise should be entitled to mitigate interest and civil penalties in all cases, but</li>
	<li>use should be restricted to exceptional cases of financial hardship, injustice, or difficult points of tax liability".</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
We have ruled out any mitigation in cases of "financial hardship, injustice or difficult points of tax liability", and I think that we have moved in the wrong direction. We should have discussed the amendments to clause 23 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), and to clause 24, tabled by Opposition Members, which would have allowed the tribunal to review the decisions of the commissioners on mitigation. The commentators on the Bill have been pressing for that, whereas I am not aware that anyone has pressed for the rejection of the Keith committee's recommendation in chapter 18.4.41.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is seeking to have it all ways. When it was argued last week that there should not be a power of mitigation available to the commissioners unless it was also available to the VAT tribunal—I am not suggesting that my hon. Friend argued that case— I made it perfectly clear how my mind was turning. I said that if that were to be pressed I would prefer to forgo that power of mitigation for the commissioners because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield recognises in quoting from the Keith committee report, that was on the basis that there should not be a possibility of arguing a reasonable excuse to the VAT tribunal. Then the only possibility of varying the fixed penalty which was to be imposed by totally arithmetic means—the original Keith recommendation—with no regard to judgment, or whether there was a good excuse, or whether the person had behaved with due diligence, was to give a power of mitigation to the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now changed that whole basis. We have changed it so as to allow people to argue that they have behaved properly and have a reasonable excuse and therefore should not suffer the penalty. In those circumstances it is right, as the hon. Member for Stretford said, that we should revert to a position where there is a basic and fundamental possibility of the commissioners dealing with the quite exceptional case under the terms agreed—I refer to the Public Accounts Committee's invigilation of it but to go beyond that would be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now made my position clear. I have done it at this point because it allows hon. Members to come back on Report, but my hon. Friends are seeking to eat their cake as well as have it. We all like to do that, but it is not on in these circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Freeman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's argument in so far as if we were arguing that if the Commissioners were to exercise mitigation it would be reasonable to argue that the VAT tribunal itself should be the court of appeal rather than leaving the case with the commissioners alone. If one removed the mitigation that would remove that particular argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two points to put to the Minister. The first is minor. Will the Minister assure the Committee that he will table an amendment to delete the reference to mitigation in line 36 of clause 24? If there is no reference to mitigation in clause 23, there must be a consequential amendment to clause 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Committee will recall that under clause 12(4) the tribunal has the power to mitigate or reduce the penalty in cases of civil fraud when the trader is cooperating with the authorities. The maximum concession is 50 per cent. Can my hon. Friend assure us that
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
in the coming year he will monitor the decisions of the tribunal, because, under clause 24, the tribunal will be able to judge only whether a particular assessment, penalty, interest or surcharge is reasonable. It will not have power to change the quantum of the penalty interest or surcharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be cases when the tribunal would wish to have the right to mitigate when it is justified. I cannot give any specific examples tonight, but I hope that the Minister will assure us that he will keep the operation of the clause under surveillance to ensure that the tribunal is not denied powers which might in the long run be to the benefit of traders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise rather unexpectedly to support what my hon. Friends the Members for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) have said about clause 23. When I agreed not to move my amendment, I thought that clause 23 was being withdrawn for reconsideration. Had I realised that the Government had thought that that was the end of the matter, I would not have withdrawn my amendment. Perhaps I am at fault for misunderstanding. I now regret what I have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems extraordinary, preposterous and unjust that we should be denying to the taxpayer, in the case of Customs and Excise levy imposts, what the taxpayer under the aegis of the Inland Revenue expects as a matter of right. He can go to judicial tribunals, having had the matter initially determined. He can then go to the general or special commissioners and then go forward to the High court to have the whole matter reviewed. It seems to me that that is being denied to the taxpayer under VAT and the Government should reconsider that. I am sure that many of my right hon. and honourable Friends will wish to press this matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman). A consequential amendment, to which he referred, to clause 24 will be necessary and it will be appropriate to deal with it on Report. He also refered to clause 12(4) which covers the range of penalties for civil fraud. When the co-operation of the taxpayer can reduce the penalty to 50 per cent. That still wholly applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not concealed my view on this matter. I made my view perfectly plain in our discussions on Thursday. I went out of my way earlier this evening to give a clear indication of what was in my mind. I have received no representations from Committee members who heard me. I rather resent the suggestion that this provision had been foisted onto the Committee. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) that I made my views very clear and the Committee will remember that. I assure him that I have made it very clear. It is in the memory of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not entertain any thought that my hon. Friend would by some underhand means attempt to put one over on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The very basis of the Keith philosophy on decriminalisation was to move from the position where those offences were criminal matters which could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
be pursued in the criminal courts and broadly speaking, to make them civil offences with no fixed penalties. Therefore, there would be some certainty about the penalty that would follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith recommendation was that there should be no judicial review by the tribunals of the amounts, or even of whether the penalty should be imposed. We are now giving a clear right of appeal to the tribunal and to the commissioners on the grounds that the taxpayer exercised due diligence or had a reasonable excuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable that, having wrung those concessions out, the feeling is that we can go further and ask the tribunals to judge the size of the penalty. That would mean an enormous flood of litigation because any taxpayer who has the penalty imposed will seek to go to the VAT tribunal to have it reduced. That would go away from the basic philosophy of Keith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps some of my hon. Friends and Opposition Members may want to go away from that basic philosophy, but it is one which has been widely canvassed, given much exposure and I believe that the general philosophy behind Keith is widely accepted. I am not saying that it was unanimously accepted; of course it was not. There were people who stood out against it, but on the whole it was widely accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concessions and changes that have been made in the interests of the taxpayer have been worth making. We now have a balanced package and we should see how it goes, always bearing in mind, as my hon. Friend has indicated, that, in the very nature of things, we will be monitoring what happens. If in time the Government of the day wish to bring forward, or are under pressure to make changes in the legislation, that can be done. We can return to those matters on Report. It seems wiser to allow that to happen by doing what I trailed earlier this evening and mentioned during our debates last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intrude on the private row in the Conservative party but I understand what the Minister is saying and it may be helpful if I come to his assistance. I entirely understand the logical case that the Minister is putting, but I would like to ask one final question. If the tribunal have no power to vary the amount assessed, what happens when, under clause 20(3) for example, the commissioners exercise discretion in calculating the amount of the assessment? In other words, it is not an automatic amount that follows under the Act; it is not simply a mathematical calculation, but a discretion which they must exercise before they can decide the amount that is due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, is the VAT tribunal entitled to say that that discretion was wrongly exercised on its merits or is it bound by the amount that the commissioners have found and unable to vary that amount? I hope that I have made myself clear to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, when the calculation of the amount is not merely a matter of mathematics and working out the amount from the provisions of the Act, but the commissioners are called upon, under clause 20(3) to exercise discretion in deciding the amount, will there be power to interfere with that discretion and vary the amount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the assessment has to be what the commissioners best judge it should be, as we discussed earlier. The penalty which follows the
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
tax assessment may be appealed against if there is reasonable excuse, and so on. I understand that the size of the penalty cannot be mitigated or reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it is not a question of mitigation or reduction.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have to take advice on the precise details. I am advised that the amount can be appealed against. In other words, it could be suggested that the commissioners had not used their best judgment in arriving at an assessment, or that they had made a mistake in the mathematics. The rate of the penalty that applied and what percentage it should be could not be varied. I think that that goes some way to meet the hon. Gentleman's request, and it is in line with my replies to several of his earlier questions. The VAT tribunals can review the evidence upon which the penalties will be based, but the size of the penalties are mathematically determined and cannot be reduced or mitigated, either by the commissioners or by the VAT tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 26, line 20, leave out from "where" to first "the" in line 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25 deals with settling appeals by agreement and is very useful. However, the Law Society has suggested that it suffers from a defect, in that it applies only to cases in which a notice of appeal has been given by the taxpayer. It said that whereas that was fairly regular in income tax cases, it may not be so in VAT cases, in which the practice is for notices of appeal to be given only when it is thought necessary for an appeal to be heard. Amendment No. 65 seeks to meet that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment's effect would be to treat a written agreement between a taxpayer and Customs and Excise as a binding agreement, of the sort envisaged in clause 25—that is, akin to the decision of a VAT tribunal. The legal implications of that need to be examined carefully. I am prepared to consider the point expressed by my hon. Friend and the Law Society with considerable care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is about what would happen, for example, if the facts were subsequently found to be incomplete or misstated or that there had been a fundamental change in circumstances. Would one expect the written decision to have binding force?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to give the matter careful consideration, without commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for all that my hon. Friend has said.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 27, line 4, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need detain the Committee for only a moment. The amendment stems from an earlier amendment. I, too, had read the Law Society brief. It was difficult to understand that when a notice of appeal had not been given there could be deemed adjudication on appeal under the clause. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the effect of someone withdrawing a notice of appeal when the commissioners have not exercised their right to proceed with the appeal is that it is treated as if the commissioners and the appellant have reached agreement that the decision under appeal should be upheld without variation? If that is so, does it mean that neither the appellant nor the commmissioners can go into it again and that it stands as an appeal that has been decided so that the original decision of the commissioners is upheld?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We move into deeper water with some of these amendments. At least, it is deeper water for non-lawyers. I understand that the effect of the amendment would be to withdraw the provision for formally settling an appeal withdrawn by an appellant without reference to the tribunal. The provision is made before settling certain types of agreements. The withdrawal of clause 25(4) would leave no provision for such a withdrawn appeal to be treated as a binding decision of the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25(4), like the other parts of the clause, follows the Keith committee recommendation that VAT legislation should mirror closely section 54 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Previously, Customs and Excise had settled many appeals informally before they reached a formal hearing. The Government consider that as part of the Keith package they should formalise those agreements. Therefore, if the subsection is left in the Bill, it will ensure that if the appellant withdraws his appeal, the assessment is upheld with effect from the date of lodgment of the appeal. The Government would not wish an appellant to use the appeal procedure as a way of deferring his liability to pay VAT, which I am sure is a view shared by the hon.

It is right and proper that the legislative father, so to speak, of the VAT tribunals should be transferred from the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to the Lord Chancellor. This move is in line with other developments as regards the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. It has generally been forecast and welcomed. I hope that the Committee will approve it.
