	<section>
	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. R. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Transport (Amendment) Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesday, 4th April, and Thursday, 5th April, at Half-past Ten o'Clock."</p></blockquote>
I hope that this will be convenient to right hon. and hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the point of view of the convenience of the Committee, we should bear in mind the fact that Business after the Recess will be mostly financial Business, which is exempt from the Rule. Although this Bill is very short, it is also very important, and I think it is generally accepted that we should pay every attention to its provisions. Would it not be in the best interests of the fullest consideration of these provisions if we met once a week, on a Tuesday? I suggest Tuesday at 10.30 a.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that suggestion is wise. The House reassembles on a Tuesday, and I imagine that the majority of Members will not be in the House at 10.30 a.m. on the first Tuesday after the Easter Adjournment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we make it Thursday? There is another engagement on the Wednesday which hon. Members would like to attend. I do not suggest that it should have priority over this Committee, but certainly Wednesday is not a convenient day. I would suggest that we meet on one day a week—a Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are anxious to meet the wishes of the Committee. The idea of meeting on Wednesday and Thursday of the first week was to assist hon. Members for the very reason which has been mentioned—that in the following week we have the Budget. Hon. Members are always very fully occupied during that week. I believe we should meet on the Wednesday and the Thursday of the first week, if necessary—it may not be necessary—
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
and we could probably then make some other arrangement for the following week. If we met on the Wednesday and Thursday we should probably finish the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of all the Wednesdays on which it is inconvenient for this Committee to meet, I suggest that the Wednesday before the Budget is the most inconvenient. Nobody here deceives himself by imagining that the whole Business of the House is done on the Floor of the House or in the Committees. There is an overriding engagement for hon. Members on this side of the House for that Wednesday. I feel sure that in a similar position hon. Members opposite would appreciate the difficulty. I do not think my hon. Friends are too sticky about the question of whether it should be Tuesday or Thursday, but we want to keep Wednesday of that week free. I hope that we can reach an agreement on that point at least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it necessary for me to move an Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest we meet on Thursday of the first week and Tuesday of the following week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would remind the Committee that we are discussing whether we should meet on two particular days and are not discussing the proceedings after those two days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to delete "Wednesday, 4th April, and."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can consider the arrangements for subsequent days when we next meet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Transport (Mr. Barnes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that if we accept the Amendment we shall meet in the first week on one day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; on the Thursday. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Main Question, as amended, put, and agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Adequate notice should be given of Amendments, as moving them without such notice causes inconvenience. As a general rule, therefore, I shall tend not to select manuscript Amendments. The first two Amendments on the paper are not selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(INCREASE OF ROAD HAULIERS' RADIUS OF OPERATIONS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that you have not seen fit to select the first Amendment, Mr. Diamond, which would seek to leave out the radius of 60 miles and to insert one of 26 miles. I do not propose to contest your Ruling in any way, of course. Clause 1 raises the fundamental issue which we are here to discuss; it brings us straightaway to the vital part of the Bill and to its real purpose. If by some mischance it were to become law it would completely destroy the Transport Act, 1947.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the matter is the suggestion that we should extend the range of private operations from 25 miles to 60 miles and that, of course, is quite contrary to the provisions of the original Act, the purpose of which was said to be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To provide or secure or promote the provision of an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport."</p></blockquote>
A subsidiary object of the Act was that this transport should be conducted on a self-supporting basis, and my first submission is that if the Bill were accepted that would not be possible. The objects of the promoters of the Bill are obvious; indeed, I would say that if the Transport Act is to survive in any real sense at all for road haulage, then we must not accept the figure of 60 as the radius of private operations. A radius of 60 miles would mean a diameter of 120 miles and that, in turn, would mean that by choosing certain selected centres throughout the country the private operators could take the whole of the industrial work of the country, could cover the whole of the industrial area and thereby could take the cream of the traffic and leave the Road Haulage Commission as a quite ineffective organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to discuss this question properly we must consider why the figure of 25 was selected in the first place as being a reasonable radius beyond which traffic would be regarded as long-distance traffic. In the course of the proceedings on the 1947 Act the Minister said quite clearly and quite frankly that 25 was an arbitrary figure—that there was nothing sacred about it. He gave fairly lengthy
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
reasons, which I do not propose to repeat, as to why the figure of 25 was eventually selected as a fair compromise or, at any rate, as the most suitable figure for the purpose. On 19th March, 1947, speaking on this very question, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the main [it was] as an administrative convenience to cover the bulk of local transport that takes place."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th March, 1947; 	<i>Standing Committee B;</i> c. 2081.]</p></blockquote>
He went on to point out that he had provided in the Bill a certain amount of elasticity. It is laid down in the 1947 Act that permits may be given for journeys beyond that radius for suitable purposes. Unfortunately—and I say this in passing—the object of the Act has subsequently been largely, if not destroyed. at any rate considerably changed by the generosity of the Minister about C licences. In my opinion he has given far too many of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This 25-mile radius gave an operating area of some 2,000 square miles. I will not argue over that figure, for I remember the arguments which took place before as to whether it was 2,000 square miles and I remember that some statistician stated that it was 1,875. In any event, it is something in the region of 2,000 square miles. The proposal in the Bill would increase that area to something over 11,000 square miles—a very considerable increase which, I submit, would completely destroy the purpose and the effectiveness of the Road Haulage Commission's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with the point of what is a suitable figure at which to draw a line between short-distance and long-distance traffic, I would draw attention to some evidence which was given before the Royal Commission on Transport in 1930 by Sir Maxwell Hicks, Chairman of the Long-Distance Road Haulage Committee of Inquiry—a Committee which I understand consisted of the principal firms in the industry. He submitted a Memorandum to that Royal Commission in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of this Memorandum and of the investigations made by the Committee, a long-distance haulier has been taken to be a person, firm or company who is the owner of mechanically-propelled vehicles of any weight who for his own profit utilises those vehicles for the transport of goods by road belonging to other persons for distances in excess of 30 miles from the base from which such vehicles operate."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
That was the opinion of one of the principal men in the industry who regarded the figure of 30 miles as the division between short-distance and long-distance traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1946 the Road Haulage Association issued a booklet about the shortcomings of road transport control in Germany and in that booklet they defined long-distance road haulage as a distance—not a radius —"in excess of 50 kilometres," which gives us just over 30 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what Hitler laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that we should support Hitler in any way, but by giving this figure the Road Haulage Association were at any rate giving some basis which we should examine, because we have to consider what the people in the trade have, after examination. regarded as a suitable figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hitler may have been in the trade but he is a very curious authority to quote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that Hitler should come into this in any shape or form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the Road Haulage Association presumably felt it was a useful argument from their point of view to quote this figure because it seems to have been the only figure they could lay their hands on. They said that in a certain country, which unfortunately happened to be ruled by Hitler, this area had been laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Jeger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was in 1946, which was after Hitler's time; he had been liquidated by then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I overlooked that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any case, Hitler is dead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So is the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That strengthens my point. May I come to an authority which may possibly attract a little more consideration than the one I have just quoted. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, on 23rd July, 1947, during
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
the consideration of the Lords Amendments to the 1947 Act, said that the road hauliers themselves had proposed 20 miles as the limit for the small man. I give these figures for what they are worth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give another one. The Association of the British Chambers of Commerce issued a Report in 1946 on Nationalisation of Inland Transport, signed by the President, who is the hon. Member for Stockport, South (Sir A. Gridley). In their Report, they mentioned the figure of 30 miles. I think that it might be of advantage to the Committee if I read a short extract from that Report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each form of transport should concentrate on the role for which it is specially fitted. In connection with railborne traffic, railhead points should be established in all important centres, and, as far as possible, the railways should handle traffic between these points in full wagon loads. The function of distribution to and from railhead, and short direct hauls of under, say, 30 miles, should be the special province of road transport, though it is not suggested that road transport should be restricted to such short distance hauls."</p></blockquote>
They did not say "private transport."
	<br><blockquote><p>"There should be full co-operation so that both road and rail would have an interest in seeing that traffic was induced to pass by the most economical route. Representatives of road and rail should be interested in obtaining traffic for either form of transport. Road transport would have to assume the obligations of common carriers which at present are only shouldered by the railways."</p></blockquote>
I would say "Amen" to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The continuance of the present arrangements would make it impossible to put railways on a sound financial basis, since it would leave the road hauliers free to select the cream of the traffic and place the railways at an impossible disadvantage."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was the date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was 1st May, 1946. These various figures range from 20 miles to 31½ miles. As the suggested distances come from people who have been concerned with the trade, I think that the figure of 25 miles, which it is proposed to alter by this Clause, is a fairly reasonable compromise between the various suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that a radius of 60 miles would destroy the whole basis, because it would have depots at five, six or seven places in the country and cover the whole of the industrial areas, and the remaining road haulage traffic would be practically nil. It is not necessary to go into lengthy arguments about this, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
the whole subject has been thoroughly discussed in connection with the previous Act both here and in another place, and when the Lords Amendments came back to the Commons there was an Amendment inserted into the 1947 Act by another place making the radius 50 miles. That, however, was very easily dealt with in the House of Commons. Fortunately, the Government were in a better position then than they are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further very strong argument I suggest against the Clause which is now proposed. Under the principal Act, the Transport Commission were compelled to buy up the business of the short distance hauliers and they have bought them up in most cases. The total compensation is expected to exceed £70 million. These businesses have been bought up, compensation has been paid and the traffic has been reorganised on a new basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now it is suggested in this Clause that the whole thing should be thrown overboard, the £70 million more or less wasted, and the hauliers should again be entitled to enter into business within this new 60 mile radius, covering some 11,000 square miles of operation. I suggest that that is quite unrealistic, quite unfair and would destroy the efficacy of the principal Act. It would have a very serious effect on the finances of the Corporation, which might please hon. Members on the other side of the Committee, but which in the National interest is something which we, as Members of Parliament, have to consider very carefully indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have drawn attention to the fact that the Minister, in laying down 25 miles in the principal Act, admitted, and indeed stressed, that 25 miles was not just a line beyond which we could say, "Everything is long distance," or within which we could say, "Everything is short distance." But that was the considered decision of Parliament, after weighing up all the arguments for and against, when the principal Act was being discussed, and I repeat that it should be noted again that beyond the 25 miles there is the proviso that the Minister has discretion in his issue of permits under the Act to
	<br><blockquote><p>"take into consideration the needs of, and any special circumstances affecting, the locality in which is situated the operating centre of any vehicle to which the permit would relate."</p></blockquote>
I submit that for these reasons the Clause cannot be allowed to stand. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
the principal Clause of the Bill, and I realise that, in saying that, I am more or less suggesting that the Bill should not be allowed to stand, because this is the core of the whole matter, and it will demand very careful consideration. I think that I have submitted one or two preliminary points which must be taken into consideration before Parliament sends this Bill forward on its course and thereby destroys the Transport Act of 1947.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. H. Hynd), has made some interesting points, most of which were covered on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill. I would like to deal, not very comprehensively, with one or two of the points which he has made. The basis of his case, as I understand it, is that if this Bill and, in particular, the first Clause of the Bill were to become law, it would undermine the whole working of large sections of the Transport Act, 1947. I think that is a gross exaggeration of the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When all is said and done, this Clause merely has the aim of extending the radius of operation of the A and B licence holders without a permit from a radius of 25 miles to 60 miles. It is true that a number of these hauliers, in the event of this Clause becoming law, would, from time to time, undertake hauls within that extended radius. It is also true that to the extent to which the existing short distance haulier had to go outside his present 25 mile radius, it would ease the pressure of competition within the sphere of local haulage, and, as the British Road Services are active in the local haulage field and are indeed advertising local haulage facilities extensively in every newspaper throughout the country, it is quite possible that the British Road Services would lose by way of business outside the 25 mile radius but would gain by further business which would come to them in the essentially short distance field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Accrington suggested that this extension of the radius from 25 miles to 60 miles would mean a diameter of 120 miles. He gave figures which were supposed to indicate the enormous area which in the future would be covered by the independent hauliers if this Clause became law. Even if the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
radius were to be extended from 25 miles to 60 miles, it by no means follows that the free haulier would be in a position to take advantage of that extension and would always run a distance of 120 miles. The whole thing is too silly for words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hauliers do not run from one side of the perimeter to the other side of the perimeter. If they did, they would very soon be in the bankruptcy courts because they would have empty running both from their base to the perimeter in the first place and empty running from the perimeter back to their base at the end of the day. There would be so much empty running that they would be out of business in no time. The independent hauliers work, of course, from their bases, and the suggestion that they would all be running distances of 120 miles all the time is quite fantastic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I make allowances for his rhetoric, the hon. Gentleman will, of course, realise that I never said anything of the kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that a possible suggestion is that the hon. Member, like some of his hon. Friends, has been burning the midnight oil in making careful mathematical calculations which have had the effect of changing the composition of this Committee among other things. He did give the Committee his figure of the total area which would be embraced by the free hauliers if the routes of operation were extended. The hon. Member for Accrington also said that when the 1947 Bill was being debated on the Floor of the House, the Minister said that the 25 mile radius was arbitrary. That, of course, is obviously the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not very impressed by the story he gave of the position in Germany. Conditions in that country on the roads differ very greatly from conditions in this country. They have not got to the same extent as we have narrow, winding roads. They have the advantage of the autobahns which link up the large towns much more easily than is the case in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even so, I would draw the attention of the Committee to the invidious position of the coastal hauliers of this country to whom the 25-mile radius is a great hardship. It is most unfair, if one contrasts the position of the haulier who is working in the ports with the position of the haulier who is working from
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
an inland base. Take, for example, the case of a haulier in Leeds. His operations can fan themselves out north, southeast and west to Harrogate, Barnsley, Pontefract, Huddersfield and Halifax. He has a complete circle of operations; but in the case of the port operators—people working from Liverpool, Hull, Bristol, or places of that kind—their operation is actually cut in half. It is indeed a most serious matter in the case of many of our principal ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in the case of Liverpool which, as hon. Members know, is a very important city in the milling industry, it is not possible today, with existing transport services, to get to the Port of Liverpool a great deal of the produce which is required by the milling industry. If I may, I should like to read an extract from a statement issued recently by the Liverpool and District Millers' Association, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From the point of view of expediency we have especially in mind not only the collection of a great variety of produce from innumerable farms, more or less remote from industrial areas, and from which urgent transport is so often required to prevent deterioration of raw materials, but also the delivery of flour and many other finished products for human consumption as well as feeding stuffs for agricultural interests in rural areas. In this connection it should not be overlooked, of course, that the greater part of the country's milling capacity is situated at the principal ports, to which substantial quantities of homegrown wheat and other cereals, requiring specialised handling are constantly delivered."</p></blockquote>
It is the case that the milling industry in Liverpool, and I believe in our other principal ports, has found that since the 1947 Act became operative the transport facilities from the outlying rural areas to the ports have considerably deteriorated. If the radius were to be extended from 25 miles to 60 miles, as we suggest, the position would be greatly improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Accrington also pointed out that the Minister had made it plain when the 1947 Act was under consideration that the 25-mile radius was created in order to cover local transport. I believe those were his words, but hon. Members like myself who sit for Lancashire constituencies appreciate the difficulties. I will put quite frankly to the Committee the position of the Raw Cotton Commission in Lancashire, about which no doubt the hon. Member for Accrington knows a great deal more than I do. As
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
the Committee knows, the raw cotton comes into the Port of Liverpool under the direction and organisation of the Raw cotton either goes from the docks to the coton either goes from the docks to the warehouses or occasionally goes direct to the spinning mills in South Lancashire. In the past the Raw Cotton Commission have been using the independent haulier for local hauls from docks to warehouses and have been using British Road Services —very largely because they have had no option—to take cotton from the warehouses to the spinning mills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, as the Committee will know, there has been a dispute between the Raw Cotton Commission—a Government-inspired organisation—and British Road Services, in consequence of which the Raw Cotton Commission have declined to pay the increased charges which were about to be imposed by British Road Services. At the moment, in the face of very considerable difficulties, the Commission are trying to handle all their transport with the use of the independent haulier and without the help of British Road Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say without the slightest hesitation that if the Raw Cotton Commission were to be put the straight question—"Would you prefer the existing radius of 25 miles or would you prefer it to be increased to 60 miles?"—hon. and right hon. Gentlemen would get a very forthright reply; for the Raw Cotton Commission would like the radius of operation to be extended to 60 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman any evidence at all of that, or is he relying upon a conjecture based upon what he has said? Has there been any direct representation on the subject?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought it was obvious. I have statements here from the Raw Cotton Commission in which they make it quite plain that they are not prepared to pay what British Road Services ask, and I also have correspondence here which makes it perfectly plain that, if they can, they want to use the independent road hauliers. I should have thought that that was sufficient answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again.
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
This is a very important point. The hon. Gentleman distinctly said that if the proposition that the 25-mile radius should be increased to a 60-mile radius were put to the Raw Cotton Commission it would receive very strong support from them. In fact, he said there would be a forthright answer. Has the question been put to them and has there been a forthright answer, or is the hon. Member assuming that there would be such an answer from the evidence he has in his possession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite true that there has not been a forthright answer. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not appreciate that at the moment the Raw Cotton Commission are trying to use exclusively vehicles of the independent hauliers and, that being the case, I think one is entitled to infer that they would prefer to do that without impediments rather than with impediments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position does not end with the transit of cotton from Liverpool to the spinning towns in South Lancashire. As the hon. Member for Accrington knows, subsequently there is the transit of yarn and later of cloth from the spinning towns of South Lancashire to the weaving towns of North Lancashire, and later to the finishers in the Manchester area. If we take cotton from the spinning mills of Bolton to Colne in North Lancashire for weaving, that is a distance of 27 miles, and at present the spinner is compelled either to take out a C licence and transport the cotton himself or alternatively to give the transit to British Road Services. Again, when the cloth has been finished and has to be exported from Liverpool docks, it has to be taken from Manchester to Liverpool, which is a distance of 37 miles; and again the exporter is compelled to use the services of B.R.S.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think any hon. Member opposite, especially if he has any knowledge of Lancashire, will disagree with me when I say that the general feeling of people in the cotton trade both in Liverpool and the county itself—I put it no higher—is that the services which are being provided and the charges which are being asked by British Road Services are nothing like what they ought to be, and I believe that if a ballot were taken of people in the cotton industry they would make it quite clear that they would prefer for the private operator a radius of 60 miles to a radius of 25 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
May I make this point in conclusion? It is all very well for the hon. Member for Accrington to say that it is possible for independent hauliers to obtain permits, but he knows quite well what the history of permits has been during the last year or two. It simply is not good enough to say that beyond a radius of 25 miles people can obtain a permit to travel long distances, because in fact that is not the case to any considerable extent at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on these benches believe that so far from completely undermining the structure of the Transport Act, this small reform would, on the contrary, put British Road Services on their mettle. We believe that if we leave a nationalised industry in a position of developing a monopoly, the probability is that inefficiency will become worse and worse as time goes on, whereas if we apply the spur of only limited competition the probability is that the nationalised organisation will seek to put its house in order and give the community the service to which the community is entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the concluding remarks of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Toxteth (Mr. Bevins) who suggested that this measure of limited competition would put the Transport Commission on their mettle. I would be glad if either he or his hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) would tell us how they propose to make this a limited measure of competition having regard to the general position of road freight-carrying vehicles. in which one has seen that there are now 800,000 vehicles on the road, of which 760,000 are competing with the 40,000 vehicles of the Transport Commission. When we last debated the subject in the House I tried to get the hon. Member for Monmouth to explain how they proposed to effect this limited measure of competition, and how far they proposed to allow the expansion of the road freight-carrying industry to continue in this country before they felt that we had reached saturation point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill, of course, embraces a subject which is not normally considered to be within the ambit of a Private Member's Bill. I do not grumble about that. but I would point out that I do not remember—although I have not searched the records—any case during my years in the House in which a Private Member's Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
has sought completely to upset the provisions of a major Government Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Braine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House gave it a Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said I was not complaining about it. I was simply putting on record that I knew of no single occasion in which this has been done, because it has never been considered the function of Private Member's legislation to seek a complete reversal of the legislation of the Executive. This Bill, and in particular this Clause, in effect destroys entirely the provisions of the 1947 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major McCallum</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will remember that we are considering one Clause of the Bill and one Clause only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of your Ruling, Mr. Diamond, I will not make the comment which I was about to make, that I did not think the Hill Farming Act was a major Government Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this Clause, as has already been explained, is to extend the area of operation of A and B-licence vehicles. I have tried to discover why 60 miles was considered to be the Utopia, the right figure which we ought to fix. I tried to discover that from the debate on the subject in another place, and there it seemed that the promoters of a similar Measure were under a complete misapprehension in that they selected 60 as the ideal figure because they said that was the figure which had obtained in relation to long-distance road vehicles during our wartime control, when all traffic operating outside that distance was taken over by the Ministry. But at that time we were not considering a 60-mile radius but a 60-mile haul so that the promoters of this Bill have gone exactly double the distance which was considered necessary under our wartime measures to secure effective control and integration of the transport services of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be very glad if we could have some enlightenment on the subject to show what is sacrosanct about the figure of 60
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
miles. I can find no Royal Commission or Inquiry in the history of the last 100 years which suggested that there was something about the figure of 60 miles which made it the right and proper distance to fix as the sphere of the private operator. If we could know what is behind this figure it might help some of us to make up our minds on the Clause. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members will recall that on Second Reading of the Bill I offered to support the Bill, so that if the arguments of hon. Members are sufficiently cogent they may persuade me to support the Question that this Clause should stand part. I very much doubt whether their cogency is sufficient to accomplish that, however.

We cannot do as we did in the 1947 Act, lay upon a statutory body a solemn obligation such as we laid upon the British Transport Commission, not only to provide an integrated service but financial obligations which were definite and complete, and then take away from them the wherewithal to enable them to meet those obligations. The promoters of the Bill know that if Clause 1 continues in its present form nationalised transport in this country is gone for ever. The purpose of the Bill is to wreck the whole structure of the nationalised industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether hon. Gentlemen have considered what would be the position in the transport industry if Clause 1 remained. What sort of hornet's nest will they bring about their heads from the men who have taken over and have lost their vehicles and businesses? I invite hon. Members, as I invited them in the House of Commons, to tell us what they are going to do about the men whose businesses have been taken over, and who are not allowed to operate even within 25 miles. Are hon. Members going to say to these men, "You shall have the vehicles back again, and you shall operate in a 60-mile radius"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. P. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this not outside the scope of the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Mr. Diamond will tell me when I am transgressing. I am asking: Who will be brought into this Clause and be entitled to operate vehicles up to 60 miles? Will it be those men whose businesses have been taken over? Will they pay the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
price for being set up in business again that the Transport Commission paid them for taking their businesses over?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Toxteth (Mr. Bevins) made the point which has been made so many times about the poor operators on the sea coast, that their sphere of operations is limited because behind them they have the sea and therefore they are placed at a great disadvantage compared with an operator located, say, in Leeds. I do not know that the sea coast operators will be very much happier to find that operators in Leeds will have a 60-mile radius. The seacoast operators will still be placed at the disadvantage of having the sea behind them. It will not be any great consolation to them to know that they have a right of operation into the North Sea for 60 miles instead of 25 miles as at present, while the operator in Leeds can go for 60 miles all round. The comparable position remains exactly the same. If we made the radius 120 miles we should not remove the hardship on men who chose to establish their businesses on the sea coast. There is not very much in that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now give some examples to show to what extent the whole industrial area of the country will be covered if the provisions of Clause 1 take effect. Take operators in the city a part of which I have the honour to represent in this House, Birmingham. They will be able to cover journeys between Birmingham and Gloucester, Northampton, Oxford, Nottingham, Macclesfield, Shrewsbury and Hereford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And Liverpool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Liverpool is outside the 60-mile radius. When we come to consider the operation diagonally over 120 miles, by virtue of being sited in Birmingham operators will be able to cover journeys from Northampton to Stoke-on-Trent, from Gloucester to Derby, from Leicester to Shrewsbury, and so on. The hon. Member was concerned about Liverpool. The distance between Liverpool and Birmingham is about 80 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eighty-seven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eighty-seven and a half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) on his meticulous accuracy, and I stand

	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
corrected, but the alteration does not make a bit of difference because the operator will be able to go only 60 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now let us consider the large industrial areas, and take Sheffield. We find that the operator there can work from Sheffield to Leicester, and therefore he links up with the Birmingham man who operates from Birmingham to Leicester. One will get, by arrangement, operations from Birmingham to Sheffield. Similarly, we shall have the Sheffield man working as far as Preston and Crewe and covering the area of Cheshire and Lancashire. Let us take a man based in London. He covers the whole of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, I imagine, and he could work as far as Portsmouth, and Northampton, going north. Therefore, with the Birmingham man able to work to Northampton, coming down, and the London man able to work to Northampton, going up, it is not difficult to see that the whole of this country's road traffic can be carried quite easily under this scheme, to the detriment of the British Transport Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It was gratuitous for the hon. Member for Toxteth to suggest that the British Transport Commission would gain by getting hold of short-haul traffics. That is not the purpose of the Commission. That is not their function in life. [An HON. MEMBER: "They are doing it."] Most certainly they are doing it. They have been driven to do it. They have taken over vehicles from long-distance hauliers, but the traffic has not followed the vehicles. More C licence vehicles were put on in their place.

I was coming to the point that the traffic was not in the hands of the British Transport Commission, and that there would now be a second competitor for that traffic in the A and B licence-holders who will be free to travel these roads up to 60 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever happens to the British Transport Commission, there is going to be a most glorified dog-fight in the industry between the A and B licence-holders up to 60 miles, and the people whom you have suggested are not within the ambit of the Clause, the C licence-holders. I want to put this point as early as I can in the Committee, because it is my considered view. When considering the organisation of transport I cannot do so in relation to 25 miles or 60 miles, but only in relation to its application by rail, road or canal. We should consider transport as transport. The best service for carrying traffic should carry it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I must make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that this is not the occasion to deal with considerations of transport as transport. This is the occasion to deal with the difference between 25 miles and 60 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I must say that if one is going to consider which is the best form of transport to carry freight traffic we must regard—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One does not consider that point on the question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." I must remind hon. Gentlemen as a whole that this is not the Second Reading of the Bill and that we are limited to the question to which I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, Mr. Diamond. I will bring my remarks to a conclusion with this point. The proposal to alter the radius to 60 miles can have no other than a wrecking effect upon the Commission, which is already faced with the position of being unable to find traffic for the 39,000 vehicles that were taken over, Many of those vehicles have been sold, and many are on hire to private firms now. It seems an anomaly that when the British Transport Commission should be unable to find traffic for those vehicles, that we should seek by this Clause to worsen the position. We are dealing with the assets of the nation and of the taxpayer. This Clause will make the taxpayer face a very much heavier burden than he does today, under the operation of transport in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very interested in the comments made by the hon. Member for Perry Barr (Mr. Poole) and I propose to follow directly on the points which he made in the course of his most colourful speech. I was sorry to have to correct him about the precise distance between Birmingham and Liverpool, but it seemed to be a very pertinent point. I live just two miles from the boundary of the hon. Gentleman's constituency at Perry Barr. I live in Birmingham and represent a Worcestershire constituency, but I am in constant touch with the industrial problems of Birmingham. A great volume of raw materials and manufactured goods is carried by road between Birmingham and Liverpool, which are separated by 87 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present arrangement of the 25-mile radius for private road hauliers the greatest hardship is inflicted upon manufacturers, who are not entirely satisfied with the facilities that are offered by British Road Services. The great majority of those manufacturers desire, and would
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
welcome an extension of the radius. The private road haulier wishes to compete with British Road Services to achieve two results: greater efficiency and rapid delivery of goods between Birmingham and Liverpool, notably for shipment of goods abroad and for delivery in Birmingham of incoming raw materials; secondly, and just as important, to secure transport rates as low as possible, brought about only by intense competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of Transport, as reported in col. 1698 of HANSARD, on the Second Reading of the Transport (Amendment) Bill, accused me of talking nonsense. [HON. GENTLEMEN: "Hear, hear."] and of braying at him. I certainly said "Hear, hear" in the course of the Second Reading debate. I want to tell him that I said "Hear, hear" very loudly. I want to tell you, Mr. Diamond, why I said "Hear, hear" very loudly, without impinging on your Ruling in regard to C licences. I will not digress on to the general question of C licences, but it illustrates my point about the Birmingham—Liverpool traffic which I was mentioning earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the large increase in the number of C licences that has taken place since the Transport Act of 1947. I applauded that by saying "Hear, hear" because I have a simple belief in private enterprise of road haulage. I speak from long experience as a road haulage operator and as a user of road vehicles. My simple belief is that the more intense the competition that can be created between "C" licence holders, and between private hauliers and State vehicles, the greater the degree of efficiency that will ultimately be obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the argument of the hon. Gentleman but I cannot see where it is getting. He suggests an extension to 60 miles, but he has already told us that the distance between those two cities of Birmingham and Liverpool is greater than 60 miles, so I cannot see how this Clause would solve his problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is a radius of 60 miles, so that if the road haulier is situated in, say, Newport, Salop, he is in a position to operate between Birmingham and Liverpool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That answers the hon. Gentleman who said that would not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see that there is anything detrimental in that arrangement. The hon. Gentleman who interrupted me is close enough to the Potteries to know that, to get round the 25-mile limit imposed arbitrarily by the Ministry, the pottery manufacturers in Burslem, Hanley and Stoke make arrangements with hauliers to take their goods half of the way to the Port of Liverpool, where they are trans-shipped to another vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was said in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was reported in the national Press. I must say I have no direct evidence of that, but as it was reported in the "Daily Herald," I imagine it is authentic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I wish to make for the attention of the Minister is that the 25-mile limit was an arbitrary limit imposed by the Transport Act. Surely the right hon. Gentleman is fair minded enough, and has sufficient flexibility of mind to realise, having imposed that arbitrary limit, if it is found to be an unsatisfactory limit for the use of manufacturers in the industrial areas of the country, and for many other reasons which I have explained, then that limit should be increased in order to induce the greatest possible measure of efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I pass to the second point made by the hon. Member for Perry Barr (Mr. Poole). These were his exact words as I wrote them down—"That the passing of this Bill would completely upset major Government legislation." It would do nothing of the sort. If the radius of action of a private enterprise road haulier is increased, the effect will be simply to intensify road haulage competition. It will enable a greater number of private hauliers to compete with long distance State road haulage, and will produce two results—greater efficiency and lower costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now may I pass to the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. H. Hynd). If I may say so with great respect, he fell into exactly the same error. He said that the passing of this Bill would destroy the efficacy of the main Transport Act.
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
Surely if the Government are concerned—and as they used the fiscal weapon in the last Budget to try to discourage the growth of C licences they must be concerned—with the growth of C licences, the best means of placing a curb on their expansion is to allow road hauliers to operate over a greater radius of action from their base, which would reduce the necessity for private manufacturers to buy so many vehicles to be put on the road with C licences. The hon. Member for Perry Bar, I see, is laughing his head off. Yet he knows it to be true. He has been challenged on that point in Birmingham on many occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Member say I was challenged many times in Birmingham? It is quite untrue that I have been challenged on that assertion either in Birmingham or anywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member gives me that personal assurance, I willingly withdraw and I apologise to him. Perhaps I would have been more correct if I had said that it had been reported to me by mutual friends in Birmingham that he said so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I want to turn to two interesting points made by the hon. Member for Accrington. He referred to the arbitrary character of the 25-mile limit and then adduced as evidence the report of the Road Haulage Association in 1946 in regard to the wartime arrangements of Adolf Hitler for road transport in Germany. As a second point he adduced as evidence a statement made by Sir Maxwell Hicks in 1930. I would like to reply to both those points, which have a direct bearing on what the limit should be for the operation of private enterprise road haulage companies under the Transport Act or under this proposed amendment to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Road Haulage Association, which I read with great avidity, refers solely to the emergency wartime arrangements of Hitler in Germany between 1938 and the date of the downfall of the Nazi State. Hitler was operating an inflexible intolerant war-time economy under conditions of intense shortage of fuel of all descriptions, including petrol. It could not possibly be a reasonable argument, in support of a 25-mile or a 30-mile radius in a free economy, which I presume we all espouse in the U.K.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Champion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not many of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where competition and low cost of manufacture and distribution are vital to our national prosperity, surely it is utterly incongruous to compare the wartime economy of Hitler with our present economic circumstances in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a personal interest in the second point. Let me say at the outset that I have known Sir Maxwell Hicks for the last 15 years. I have had many business dealings with him sand I recognise him as an interested person in road haulage. I will tell the Committee exactly what was his interest. Sir Maxwell Hicks was Chairman of the long distance road /haulage firm of Macnamara Limited. That firm performed two important functions. As the right hon. Gentleman will readily confirm, Macnamara had two important commercial undertakings as part of their nation-wide business—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Champion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As well as a band?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first of those undertakings was the service and maintenance of all the road vehicles of the General Post Office for which they had a contract for many years. That does not affect in any way the argument of the hon. Gentleman, but the second function of the Macnamara undertaking impinges directly on his statement. They were long-distance road hauliers operating between the towns of London, Birmingham, and Liverpool where they had their main depots. They specialised in the London-Birmingham-Liverpool road goods services. Sir Maxwell Hicks was Chairman of that undertaking on the date when he gave evidence before the Commission to which the hon. Member for Accrington referred. So in 1930 he was very much an interested party in defining the limit for long distance hauliers as 30 miles only. I think that had he been chairman of an undertaking concerned solely with short distance operation, he would have suggested a limit proportionately higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In giving that evidence, Sir Maxwell Hicks at any rate claimed to be speaking not only for his own firm of Macnamara but for some 40 others engaged in long distance haulage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But even if he were speaking on behalf of 40 firms engaged
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
in long distance haulage, the principle would still be the same, that all those long distance hauliers would be anxious to retain to themselves the greatest possible area of operation and to restrict the area of operation of their short distance competitors. As Chairman of a long distance haulage firm, I know my friend Sir Maxwell Hicks would not object to my saying this. Sir Maxwell Hicks is still alive. He is 75 years of age and in the best of health although he has retired altogether from the road haulage business. I am sure he would not object to my making the point that his views were rather coloured on that occasion by his interest in Macnamara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as the hon. Member is coloured now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see in what way my views are coloured, other than the fact that I have an undying faith in the competence, ability and flexibility of private enterprise haulage. I do not want to see it restricted or contained in any way as the result of arbitrary rulings and regulations issued by the right hon. Gentleman and his helots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to what the hon. Member describes as the "helots" of my right hon. Friend, does he not agree that his argument simply means that he really wants to undermine the provisions of the 1947 Act, and that that is the point to which his argument is directed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his stimulating and invigorating intervention. I am not anxious to undermine the provisions of the 1947 Transport Act, for I do not think that an extension of the private road haulier's radius of action would do so. I have said several times this morning, that I want to see competition between the various branches of the road haulage industry in Britain, intensified. Although it would be out of order for me to refer specifically to railways, may I add as a corollary of the intensified competition in the road haulage industry that I want to see competition between the road haulage and the railways intensified, because the first tenet of my faith is free and unrestricted enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now miles outside this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have been led astray by the hon. Member for Wigan. I want to refer to a specialised aspect of the matters arising from an extension of the radius referred to in Clause 1, that is, the particular position of the horticultural industry. Last evening there was to have been an Adjournment debate in the House on the cost of vegetables in Coventry. The hon. Member for Perry Barr, as well as the hon. Lady the Member for Coventry, South (Miss Burton), draw their vegetables and fruit almost entirely from the constituency I represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nahum</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, very largely. We will not split hairs. That fruit and vegetables have to be transported from the Vale of Evesham and Western Worcestershire to the industrial areas of Coventry and Birmingham and the industrial connurbation of the Black Country. Evesham and the western part of Worcestershire, which produce all this fruit and vegetables, is an average distance of 35 miles from Birmingham. At the present time it is extremely difficult for growers—and as the right hon. Gentleman knows, growers in the horticultural industry are having a very rough time at present—to transport .their goods economically into the industrial areas by using British Road Services Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That organisation is not sufficiently flexible to deal with medium distance hauls of a specialised character. Many of these growers have not got vehicles of their own operating under C licences. They would find it a great help in lowering costs—and everybody in the industrial areas complains about the high cost of vegetables and fruit—if it were possible for them to use private road hauliers not operating under C licences, but who had been allowed to extend the limit of their sphere of operation as a result of this Clause being accepted.

I cannot now see as much justification for increasing the radius from 25 to 60 miles as I thought there might be when the hon. Member for Toxteth (Mr. Bevins) was speaking. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member would have realised my point had he listened carefully.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I was saying.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member cannot really believe as a generalisation that what he is saying is true. If from a map of England we discover two towns which are, say, 119 miles apart and that there is a town exactly mid-way, it is true that in these most exceptional circumstances
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
the new provision would have a magnificent effect for the haulier who happens to be at that intermediate point. But take, for example, a haulier in the City of London, who carries traffic from London to Brighton or from London to Oxford. Nobody would suggest that there is a vast bulk of traffic to go from Brighton to Oxford, which is what the hon. Member is implying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not exaggerating. The point I have taken up is precisely the point made by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is pursuing an interesting point. He must realise, however, that I took the case of two important industrial towns 87 miles apart.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apparently the hon. Member's colleagues do not grasp his meaning. The hon. Member said that a haulier in the town of Newport, Salop, which I suppose is about 20 miles from Birmingham, could, under the Bill, take traffic for 87 miles or more. This indicates that what is sought is not a 60 miles limit, but free and unlicensed effort, and the ability of the hauliers to do exactly as they did in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Toxteth (Mr. Bevins) suggested that I had been exaggerating on the question of deliverers, but I suggest that as far as this affects Liverpool the hon. Member himself makes a slight exaggeration. Most of these people have their own vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There has been such a tremendous increase in the number of these licences that I should have thought that the hon. Member for

	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft), who represents the road hauliers' interests, would have been satisfied with this gap in the Road Transport Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of 60 miles reminds me of our discussions on the various licences during the passing of the Act. Sixty miles was a figure for Which I got agreement with the trade in Liverpool at the time. They agreed that a distance of 60 miles would have been admirable for C licences, but instead they got the whole thing and have done very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Clause, obviously, is designed to undermine part of the Transport Act and to prevent its purpose as regards the integration of rail and road transport. I address these few remarks in order to help the hon. Member for Monmouth and, perhaps, to prevent him from stressing the obvious, as he sometimes does. It must not be forgotten that in the taking over of A and B licences for long distance hauls, some of the firms, such as Pickford's and all the other large concerns, now under the British Road Services were not confined to long distance hauls. Many of them had a lot of short distance work. It is because the British Road Services are continuing that business, including the short hauls, that there is now a growl about their competing with others. Pickford's, as well as other Midlands firms, are bound to be in competition if they are continuing with the traffic which they carried before being taken over. In all the circumstances, sufficient has been said here today to show that the effect of the Clause would be to make the Transport Act not worth continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have spent over £70 million, but all that the Opposition are concerned about is that the Government should subsidise the railways and that the road hauliers should still be bled by private interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kirkdale (Mr. Keenan) in a very interesting address suggested again that the purpose of the Bill is to render the Transport Act unworkable. We have, on this side, so frequently said that that is not the purpose of the Bill that I must be forgiven if I stress it again, since the hon. Member and some of his hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
Friends appear still not to understand or to believe that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal purpose of the Clause is to extend the radius of operation. The hon. Member for Perry Barr (Mr. Poole), who, I thought, was doubtful what decision he would eventually take should the Committee need to divide upon the Clause, asked why we wanted a radius of 60 miles and why we had chosen that particular figure. I am sorry that the hon. Member is not now present, but I should like to answer those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple reason why we asked that the radius of 25 miles as contained in the Transport Act should be increased to 60 miles, is that in practice the 25 miles radius just does not work. I do not think there could be a much better reason than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is the figure of 60 miles suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that—I am not dodging it. We have found in practice that under the original 25 miles limitation of radius, the ordinary independent haulier—who, as the hon. Member for Kirkdale rightly said, was, under the Act, more or less given the power to carry on short distance traffic as opposed to long distance, which was the sphere reserved to the Road Haulage Executive —has had his business and his operations completely emasculated by the existing 25 miles radius. The ordinary independent haulier asks through us, in the Bill, that we should extend his radius to give him a chance to operate on terms of fair competition with the Road Haulage Executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivor Owen Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has stated that under present arrangements, with the 25-mile limit, the private enterprise short distance haulier has been emasculated as regards his former traffic. Has the hon. Member any statistical evidence in regard, for instance, to the number of such private hauliers who have gone out of business or who have become bankrupt, or any illustrations to prove his point about the undermining of the operations of private local hauliers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that that was something which was known by everybody in the country. If the hon. Member wants documentary evidence, I and my hon. Friends all have letters from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
our constituents and others asking and praying that this part of the Bill will go through, because the private road haulier simply cannot carry on as he has been doing with the existing limiting restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have evidence, which the hon. Member can see if he wishes, in the form of letters from the customers of private road hauliers, in which they say that the 25 miles restriction prevents a private haulier from doing the job which they want him to do. We have to consider the interests, not only of the private haulier, but also of his customers. If, for instance, a farmer finds that the local haulier cannot now carry his goods to market, and if for some reason—it may be a question of price, efficiency or time —the farmer does not want to employ British Road Services to do the job, surely we ought to give that farmer, or any other individual, the opportunity of letting the private enterprise haulier carry his goods if he so desires. In practice, the 25 miles restriction, which was quite an arbitrary figure when inserted in the original Bill, has broken down. It has not been proved to be sufficiently fair for the ordinary independent haulier to carry on his business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. H. Hynd) and others asked why the figure of 60 miles has been suggested. The hon. Member for Perry Barr asked the same thing and added that if we increased the radius to 60 miles, the effect would be to wreck the British Transport Commission. We say, frankly, that 60 miles is an arbitrary figure; it is founded on no statistical basis. But if complaint is to be made because the figure is arbitrary, it must be remembered that in the Transport Act the Government themselves fixed arbitrary figures. I have already said that the 25 miles radius was an arbitrary figure. Section 39 of the Act, which provides for the undertakings of certain hauliers to be acquired by the Commission, fixes a radius of 40 miles, quite arbitrarily, as the yardstick by which compensation shall be assessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will acquit me of subscribing to the doctrine of an arbitrary figure, for a later Amendment shows that I dissociate myself from the fixing of that kind of figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has a number of Amendments on the Paper and I do not know to which one he refers. But I do not wish to be drawn aside from my point. The proposed 60 miles radius is, frankly, an arbitrary figure, but the road hauliers feel that it would be an adequate and fair radius for them in which to operate. The Committee must realise that this suggestion is not made to give the private haulier an unfair advantage over the Road Haulage Executive vehicles. Our purpose is to relieve a hardship upon the local independent haulier and upon his customers, and to help to provide a better service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Hynd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it suggested that the extension of the radius to 60 miles should be for people who previously operated within that radius and whose businesses have, presumably, been acquired under the Act, or is it to be extended to hauliers who previously did not operate within that extended radius and wish to extend their present field of operations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither the hon. Member nor I are quite so ingenuous as that. He knows perfectly well that hauliers who have been taken over, whose vehicles have been acquired and their undertakings bought out, are not concerned with the Bill. We are trying to help the private independent haulier who is still operating, or trying to operate, as I said on Second Reading. with one hand tied behind his back. We are trying to help him and his customers, and no one else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that if the Bill becomes law, no new A and B licences ought to be granted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying anything of the sort. The question of A and B licences will arise on another Clause. I am merely trying to explain the need for the 60 miles radius.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And unlimited competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not unlimited competition. The policy of the Transport Act was to provide that long distance haulage should be predominantly in the hands of the Executive or of the Transport Commission and that short distance haulage should be predominantly in the hands of the independent haulier. We do not seek
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
to destroy that division. There is an overlap as was acknowledged and admitted by the Transport Act itself and as has been acknowledged and admitted by the present system of permits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>— </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All we seek to do is to give the private haulier an opportunity to go a little further afield, to be able to make a living and to serve his customers better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disturbed about the point which the hon. Member is putting and which was made by the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro), who said that the basis should be one of the free play of private enterprise. Is it to be a limited private enterprise, a sectional private enterprise, or is there to be free play of all private enterprise which wants to run short or long distances, in order to find a price level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we suggested that free play should be allowed in the way in which the hon. Member puts it, that would, I agree, be an attempt to destroy the basis of the Act. But that is not what we say. All that we say in Clause 1 is that the present radius is not sufficient and should be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite certain that what my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster had in mind was that both British Road Services and the independent haulier and his customers would all benefit from a greater play of competition than is now possible. That, I think, is what my hon. Friend had in mind, but he was speaking, as I have been—I do not complain about it—with a certain amount of interruption, and perhaps for that reason his meaning was a little obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to another aspect, the question of the rural haulier. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) made a very fair and careful speech, largely in support of the idea to extend the radius of action. The hon. Member was speaking, as he often does in the House, as the representative of an agricultural constituency. I am in the same position, and I know that the remarks made by the hon. Member on Second Reading as far as the rural customers of hauliers are concerned, were very much appreciated by numerous people in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the countryside, the 25-mile radius has proved to be completely inoperative
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
and useless. All sorts of dodges and schemes are contrived to try to get round it. We do not approve of that—it should not be necessary—and this is another argument in favour of the Bill. The present Clause would enable all these things to be quite unnecessary, and there would be no advantage to anyone in trying to get round the provisions of the Bill. By extending the radius, farmers and others in the countryside will find it far easier to have their goods sent to market or carried from one point to another than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West, read three letters from constituents of his who had urged the acceptance of the 60-mile radius. One of his correspondents said this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We just cannot exist in 25 miles radius. It gets us to no business towns other than King's Lynn. It would not be quite so bad if the B.T.C. left the short-distance work in our hands, but they appear to be more keen on this than ever before."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 23rd February, 1951; Vol. 484, c. 1690.]</p></blockquote>
That is the opinion of merely one firm of hauliers in the hon. Members constituency. We have all had correspondence from haulage firms expressing the hope that the Bill, and in particular the proposal to allow the 60 miles radius, will be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with a remark made by the hon. Member for Accrington, who gave three examples of organisations and individuals who had suggested that the existing radius was quite sufficient. Two of these bodies have been dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster. As regards the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the hon. Member for Accrington gave their views from a document dated, I think, 1st May, 1946, the purport of which was that they thought that a radius of under 30 miles was sufficient to classify short distance from long distance traffic. If we are to have the Association's views in 1946, it would be helpful to know their views also in 1951. The views of the Association were published quite recently, in March, when they said, amongst other things:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Association's view that the Transport (Amendment) Bill"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the present Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or some similar proposal, if passed as an Act of Parliament would help materially to remedy certain defects which have become apparent during the operation of the Transport Act. This would also provide an essential
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
element of competition between the nationalised industry and private haulage companies on an equitable and just basis."</p></blockquote>
They went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, the Association considers that, in so far as the Bill is concerned with placing the granting, refusal, revocation, variation, and limitation of permits in the hands of the licensing authorities"—</p></blockquote>
I am trying not to get out of order, and am merely stating what is written here—
	<br><blockquote><p>"instead of the British Transport Commission, much will thereby be achieved in creating fair competition which will undoubtedly act as an incentive to the nationalised undertaking, in providing more reliable and efficient services. The Bill maintains an advantage for the Road Haulage Executive in the carriage of traffic outside a radius of 60 miles."</p></blockquote>
These are some of the expressions used by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce—a very important body. let me remind the Committee, whose opinion is not lightly to be disregarded, on what they think of the Bill now before the Committee. I hope, therefore, that the Committee having considered this and the other points made by my hon. Friends, will decide to give approval to the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supposing, unfortunately, that it were to happen that the Clause was not approved by the Committee, we would not in any case agree that this was the principal Clause of the Bill. The Bill contains a number of extremely import. ant Clauses. The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. H. Hynd) described this as the principal Clause of the Bill, but he was, in our opinion, not correct. This is an important matter, and I hope that the Committee will decide that, in all the circumstances, the Clause should be approved; but if in fact that does not happen, we would still wish to continue with the other Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final point. Before the Committee comes to make up its mind as to the passage or otherwise of this Clause, I hope that they will remember that this principle—in fact all the principles embodied in the Bill—has already passed through all the stages in another place and that the House of Commons has given the Bill a Second Reading against the Government's wishes and in the teeth of opposition from the Minister; otherwise we would not be here. If the Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
mittee decide to take out Clause 1 and if other Clauses are deleted that will be going against the decision not only of the House on Second Reading, but of another place as well. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will approve the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivor Owen Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that discussion this morning has revealed a definite division of opinion between the two sides of the Committee on this Clause. The Transport Act, 1947, was specifically for the purpose of co-ordinating and integrating the road and rail transport services of this country. In regard to long distance road haulage, the limit of 25 miles was laid down in the Act. One can say immediately that whatever figure was agreed upon in connection with the operation of what might be called short or long distance haulage would be arbitrary. Therefore, there is no actual, as it were, dividing principle under which short and long distance haulage can be defined. It is a question of practical economics in the field of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached the stage now in the admitted integration of the transport system of this country, both road and rail, in which it would be fatal if any attempt was successful to undermine and offset that position. After all, the Transport Act, 1947, is now practically four years old. There has been time for its operation to be seen in true perspective, and I think that so far as the development of the road transport side of the Act is concerned it has to be borne in mind, in discussing the implications of this Clause, that there are serious financial considerations involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the first outstanding fact? It is that the British Transport Commission has paid out no less a sum than £70 million for the acquisition of long distance road haulage concerns, numbering, I am informed, between 3,000 and 4,000 separate undertakings based upon a limit of 25 miles. It has also to be remembered that even within the operation of the 25-mile limit certain accepted traffic can work outside that limit as laid down in the Act. But the fundamental fact involved in this Clause, is, in my opinion, the undermining of the operation of the road haulage side of the 1947 Act. If this Clause becomes law, what is the position that we have to face?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
The British Transport Commission has acquired practically the whole of the previously operated long distance haulage firms. They have paid no less a sum than £70 million in compensation. Remove the 25-mile limit on which that compensation was paid to already existing long distance hauliers, and what do we find? We find the creation of vested interests in this long distance haulage up to a maximum of 120 miles: The exception in regard to firms based upon coastal strips does not offset the main consideration in regard to that 120 miles operation limit. In any case, even in the case of coastal operating firms, they can still work up to the maximum of 120 miles, because even if it is a straight coast there can be an arc of 25 miles radius.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAdden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Southend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are variations, of course, because I realise that the coast is not a straight line. In the inlets and waterways of Scotland we have another example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which I am trying to bring out is this: If this Clause is accepted, it will undermine the real basis of the operation of road transport in this country as laid down in the Act of 1947, and we shall have a resuscitation of private road haulage up to a maximum of 120 miles, which will skim off the cream of the road traffic and leave the British Transport Commission and especially the Road Haulage Executive as the cinderella of the road transport industry, catering for the less remunerative traffic that is left after the cream has been skimmed off by the private road haulier. Therefore, I say that in the interests of the efficient transport system of this country, in the interests of the public generally and from the wider view of the national economy that this further duplication of road transport should be resisted and a chance given for a properly integrated road and rail transport system to carry on its work on the basis of the principles laid down in the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have paid £75 million in compensation for taking over private road transport hauliers. There can be no justification for giving birth to a replica of these competing road transport firms, because we shall be merely giving an opportunity to the same people, who have already been bought out and who
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
have already received compensation, once again to come into the field from which they have been excluded and for which they have been paid appropriate compensation. I submit, therefore, that from the point of view of the national interest, efficiency of road and rail transport, and the general economy of the country this Clause should be definitely rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that a point which has been lost sight of is that there is something far bigger than this difference of opinion between us, and that is the question of the cost of living. Only by efficient transport at the cheapest possible rate, whether Government or private, can we help to reduce the cost of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a good deal of suspicion so far as this Clause and the whole of the Bill is concerned that this is just an attempt to sabotage nationalised road transport. [HoN. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I can assure hon. Members opposite that I am not a member of this Committee for that purpose. I do not like nationalised road transport; and had I been in the House at the time that the Transport Bill was passed, I should have voted against it. But we have it now, and it is in the national interest of this country to make it work as efficiently as possible. Therefore, there is no attempt, certainly not on my part, nor, I hope, on the part of Members of the Committee on this side, to sabotage the Road Transport Act, just for the sake of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Road Transport Act does need considerable amendment to enable a greater measure of efficiency on the part of private enterprise to come in and compete with nationalised transport in the short haul areas, so as to give a cheaper rate to all concerned. The 25-mile limit is an arbitrary one. The Minister has admitted that fact. A 60-mile limit would have been a fairer figure to have taken, because he had a very excellent war-time precedent for using that figure instead of the 25-mile limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perry Barr (Mr. Poole) suggested that if a 60-mile radius was given, a great many of the hauls would be much longer distances than 60 miles. We must look at this thing in a commonsense way. A haulier usually accepts orders from the town in which he is registered which would presumably be in the centre of his area. He would not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
operate from the perimeter of the 60-mile radius and register himself in a town 60 miles away from the centre of his operations. To all intents and purposes, the average haulier would certainly not operate at a greater distance than 60 miles. The hon. Member also said that if this Clause was accepted nationalised transport had gone for ever. That is not the case at all. What about the intermediate and long distance transport? Facilities will also be open to the Government to compete in the short haulage areas. They are not being turned out of that entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point has been raised by several hon. Members that £70 million has been paid to take over transport undertakings, many of which were long haulage undertakings. This question of £70 million is not at stake today. It is possible for the Government to resell the vehicles to those firms who, if the 60-mile radius is agreed to, might wish to re-enter the trade. That radius between the great industrial areas would enable the road haulage firms to operate, and the safeguard to the Government might be that they should register at the centre where they were registered previous to nationalisation. The vehicles should be resold less the necessary amount of depreciation, to the firms from whom the vehicles were taken over. If some firms were unwilling to re-enter the trade, the Government might continue to use the vehicles, or could sell them to firms still in the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of operators at the sea coast, I think they are definitely at a disadvantage compared with inland operators, although they have certain advantages over the man operating from a rural centre. They usually have their centre in a very big sea port around which they can do quite a lot of business. The suggestion made by an hon. Member opposite that they would be very little better off with a 60-mile radius than with the present 25 is absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivor Owen Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was seeking to do was to make a comparison between the difference which always exists between operators on the coast and of inland operators, whatever limit may be laid down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman who has interrupted was not the one to
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
whom I referred. I want to follow the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Hay) in his special plea for the rural areas. In the constituency for which I am privileged to be the Member, a great deal of road haulage is done. We are the centre of the Scottish woollen trade and of a very big agricultural area. The private hauliers who operated for the woollen mills used to take their loads considerably beyond 25 miles. A radius of 60 miles would enable them to recover some of the business which they lost and which they have done so efficiently. There is a very special case for amending the Transport Act so as to enable firms operating from rural areas to be given a wider radius than they have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have to mention now the question of C licences, if you will permit me to do so, Mr. Diamond. I shall not be long on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only object to the mention of the C licences so long as they do not relate to the Clause. The hon. Member will no doubt relate his remarks to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will observe your Ruling, Mr. Diamond, and relate my argument to the Clause. The C licences have been taken out in certain areas covered by the Clause only because the firms are not getting efficient and cheap transport by nationalised transport in those areas. If they want to retain that trade these firms are forced to give good service to their customers. They have taken out C licences because they have not had cheap, efficient service from nationalised transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Poole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman give one illustration of a C licence operator who separately costs his transport?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) raised quite a valuable point there, when he said that the large increases of C licences would cease, or would probably decrease substantially, when firms and individuals in the areas that we are discussing under the Clause could have more efficient transport because it would be more competitive and would be cheaper and better in every way. One of the points to which hon. Gentlemen opposite object so much, the increase in C licences, will be done away with to a very large degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an admission that it is political.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want hon. Gentlemen to realise that in bringing forward the Bill we are not—I speak for myself but I feel that I speak for other Members of the Committee—trying to sabotage nationalised transport. We do not like nationalised road transport, but we have to accept it and, in the interests of the country, we have to try to make it efficient. We have every right to ask that nationalised transport should be as efficient as possible. I do not believe that we are taking anything from nationalised transport if we extend the radius for the independent operator from 25 to 60 miles. The aim of nationalised transport should be to offer an efficiently run, long-distance road haulage service at a low cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would draw attention to the very important admission made by the hon.

[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] If that is the hon. Gentleman's opinion, and if it is shared by the other hon. Gentlemen sitting opposite, we have been informed of something that has been denied very strenuously in different places over the last two or three years. The growth of the C licences does not coincide with any lack of efficiency that might be alleged against the British Road Transport undertaking. No question relating to the efficiency of British Road Transport undertakings could have become generally known in time to have prompted traders to assume that British

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sufficient time has certainly elapsed to prove to many firms that the costs of transport make it necessary for them to take out C licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was only last year that the British Road Transport organisation took over most of these undertakings. How could it be possible for traders generally before that date to assess British Road Transport as a failure? I suggest that there has been hasty and politically-biased judgment in this matter. I want to put to the Committee this morning this point about efficiency. There is no question of efficiency dividing one part of the Committee from the other. We all believe that transport efficiency is absolutely vital today. What we object to most strongly is that if we permitted the Clause to become law transport efficiency and integration would suffer one of the strongest blows that anybody could deliver against it. If we want to make efficiency impossible in British Transport hon. Members should support the Clause, which reintroduces the chaotic condition which existed in road transport before the passing of the Transport Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman realises that whether we pass the Clause or not there is still a liability upon the private enterprise haulier to get his A or B licence from the licensing authority, who is independent. If the hon. Gentleman's contention is right, he is taking a very dim view of the powers, duties and functions of the licensing authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assuming that prior to the passing of the 1947 Act, British road transport was in a chaotic condition. From the point of view of efficiency, the transport service was definitely chaotic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was cheaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we believe that, we strongly oppose the Clause, which would perpetuate the chaotic state of road transport as we knew it before the passing of the main Act. From the point of view of efficiency we resist the Clause. We think that the Clause has almost destroyed the validity of the £70 million investment in road haulage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are opposed to the Clause for two main reasons, therefore, neither of which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
is sectional in its interests. The reasons are (1) the preservation of the £70,000,000 investment, and (2) the improvement and efficiency of road transport. The hon. Member for Henley—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Henley-on-Thames.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never heard of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Member to come down in June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant that I never heard the comment made by the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro). What he did make a feature of was the necessity to provide adequate and efficient service for agricultural interests. I am sure that everybody on this side of the Committee will agree with him regarding that necessity. We must provide efficient road as well as rail transport for widely scattered agricultural districts. The fruit and vegetable market particularly has grown up substantially around or close to the big cities and, in the main, fruit and vegetables can come within the 25 mile limit because of the proximity of these industries to the big cities and centres of population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows, of course, that the most famous and productive vegetable growing area in the United Kingdom is the Vale of Evesham. Practically the whole of the traffic flows in one direction to the Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Black Country industrial connurbations which are at present outside the 25 mile limit, and only a Clause of this description would help the growers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fully aware that Birmingham is outside the 25-mile radius for those growers but, in the main, it is found that many of these fruit and vegetable growers are already in possession of C licences. They have told us in the past that no private haulier who has other general business can possibly provide the immediate service necessary for perishable fruit. Therefore quite a large number of those people are already operating under C licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we share the view expressed by the hon. Member that an efficient agricultural service must be provided. It is my experience, however, that we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
had no substantial complaints in the district I represent from any of the agricultural interests that British Road Transport is not providing an efficient service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consumers know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fully aware of the fact that from the benches opposite, both in this Committee and in the House, there have been many complaints about the agricultural interests suffering because of British Road Transport. I suggest that many of those complaints are similar to the one made about the Cotton Commission. That Commission was supposed to have made a forthright statement to the effect that they were suffering under British Road Transport. We found out by question and answer that the British Cotton Commission had made no forthright declaration about inefficiency. I suggest that the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Nabarro) cannot supply substantial evidence that the agriculturists outside Birmingham and the manufacturers inside Birmingham have given him definite evidence that British Road Transport is falling down on the job. I defy him to supply substantial evidence about that, and I defy hon. Members opposite to do so in regard to the alleged complaint of the Cotton Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman passes from the point about agriculture, and since he defies various hon. Members on this side to produce evidence, surely he read or heard the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) in which that evidence was provided by his own colleague?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three cases out of over 119,000 hauliers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To get things into perspective, let me point out that during the four weeks ended 31st December British Road Services carried 3,272,000 tons of goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must relate his remarks more closely to the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Diamond, for going beyond the radius we are discussing. I will keep within the 25 miles which I think is a very reasonable area. The Opposition case, apart from efficiency, is based on the question
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
of competition within that area. They say that unless we extend the area we cannot get efficient competition against British Road Transport. Yet at the present time there are innumerably greater numbers of vehicles operating under auspices other than British Road Transport which provide a substantial amount of competition without extending the area. Terrific competition exists in road transport, and, in spite of that keen competition, British Road Transport have proved their capacity in the amount of goods carried. Therefore, from the point of view of competition, I can see no reason to extend the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) said on the Second Reading of this Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far, in my experience, road transport has not suffered in the least since nationalisation. I have found in my small way as a farmer, that both the nationalised transport system and the private people have served me as equally well as I was served before."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 23rd February, 1951, Vol. 484. c. 1690.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nabarro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He did not vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that pertinent quotation of the speech of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye). Under the circumstances existing today we should not permit a state of affairs to return legally in which, as has been admitted this morning, road hauliers take their goods half-way to their destination and then trans-ship them into another lorry for their ultimate destination. If they can afford the terrific expenses involved in such trans-shipment —because loading and unloading is very expensive—it seems to me there is only one explanation and it is not a question of efficiency or of a lack of facilities. It is a question of political bias which permits people to pay extra for the sole purpose of doing what the hon. Gentleman said he did not want—of sabotaging—[HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."]—the present set-up of British road transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. P. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish in any way to curtail our discussion. Indeed, it might be a good thing if hon. Members opposite pondered for a few days some of the arguments which have been adduced by my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee. I give no pledge
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
that we will not divide at any moment, so I hope hon. Members will not all leave the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will see to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to take an opportunity in the few minutes remaining to me, and perhaps also when we meet again, of dealing with some of the arguments which have been adduced by hon. Members opposite. I believe there is an overwhelming case for extending the 25-mile limit to 60 miles. When hon. Members opposite read their own remarks I believe they will see how remarkably thin is the case which they deploy against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might take as a rather typical example the speech of the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Hynd), he began by saying that it was the duty of the Transport Commission to establish an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public transport. He said that if this Bill were passed that task would be impossible. I cannot conceive that he believes that. How on earth would a limited competition from a few free and independent road hauliers take away from the efficiency of the Road Haulage Executive? Since when has a little competition from outside decreased the efficiency of the larger concern against which the competition takes place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says a small amount of competition, but surely he will agree that at the end of December, 1950, there were 119,360 A and B vehicles operating in this country, whereas the total of the Commission's vehicles was 39,932—a small amount of competition!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear that the hon. Gentleman has no conception of the set-up of this industry. These A and B licence holders are men who, by definition, are principally operating in the short distance field. That is why they have been left out of the nationalisation scheme. To suggest that suddenly these men will dispense with all their existing business, take on something entirely different, and enter into competition with a large, powerful Commission principally operating in the long distance field is the most fantastic picture to paint. No one with even an elementary knowledge of what goes on inside the road transport industry would seek to substantiate that case for more than a few moments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member does not deny that if this Clause is passed it will be competent for each one of those 119,000 vehicles to operate within 120 miles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorneycroft</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course if this Clause is accepted it will do what it says: It will extend the radius from 25 to 60 miles. It will mean that a man who is normally doing short distance work will have the same advantage as is given to the Commission; that is to say, when the occasion offers and it becomes convenient to travel 30 or 40 miles to do a job, they can do it. But one must have some regard to practical affairs. Men who are engaged in short distance work do not give up that work. It is regular work, done week by week. The traffic exists there, the business has been built up on it, very often for years. To suggest that all that is to be suddenly scrapped and, instead of that well established business, these men are to drop it all and do an entirely different job, is absurd. Indeed the hon. Member for Accrington
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
carried it to an almost fantastic length. He suggested they should even leave their existing businesses and set up five or six centres throughout Great Britain from which they would be able to dominate the whole of the industrial areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put this moderately and clearly. I hope that when hon. Members are considering these matters they will dismiss that kind of picture from their minds. There may be arguments for and against an extension from 25 miles to 60, but to suggest that the effect of it would bear any resemblance at all to the picture of the hon. Member for Accrington is complete and utter nonsense. That is the first thing, therefore, Mr. Diamond, which 1 seek to establish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
