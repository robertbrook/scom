	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (Con)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee long on this motion, because we have a lot to say about the business that is guillotined to finish by the end of this morning's sitting. However, here we are again—barely a week into the Committee stage—with a change in the batting order. Although I declared an interest on Second Reading, it may be advisable to do so again now, because I have private pension provision. We consented to the revised programme motion, not least because if we had not done so, the Government would have passed it anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our discussion on the motion gives me the opportunity to put down a couple of markers about the future conduct of our proceedings now and on Report. The Government have been open about the fact that they intend to table a substantial number of amendments on a range of issues. We have already discussed many Government amendments, but they were concerned with minor drafting matters and polishing up the Bill. We are now awaiting Government amendments affecting some meaty issues, some of which are related to tomorrow's Budget. There seems to be difficulty in attaining consistency between the regulator's powers and functions and the proposed pension protection fund, although that should have been thought through before the Bill was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister accepts my concerns about such matters. For example, we have allowed the traditional one sitting to deal with new clauses at the end of our proceedings in Committee, but if the Government have tabled a raft of new clauses they may be in difficulty. If they decide to extend the duration of the Committee stage, we would like to know about that sooner than later—and I also make an urgent plea about the amendments. We understand that big issues are involved, and the Government should make their amendments public before we debate them in Committee not only for our sake, although that would be nice, but for the outside
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004B001P2I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
organisations and individuals that often have a legitimate interest in our consideration of the Bill, and may wish to have their thoughts about proposed new parts of it transmitted through us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to receive a clear undertaking from the Minister that the Government are on top of the draftsmen day and night, to ensure that we do not get into major difficulties. I am talking not only about the Bill getting into difficulties, but about the burdens and problems that that causes for the Opposition and for outside organisations. Unless we receive early information about what amendments will be tabled, I cannot emphasise too much the fact that potential problems lie ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not lose sight of the draft regulations, either. Great tranches of the Bill rely heavily on regulations, and it would be meaningless to debate them until we have sight of them. We have not yet seen even one draft regulation; I imagine that the available manpower is too busy working on the amendments. I shall leave it there for the moment, Mr. Griffiths. I am sure that you appreciate that we shall face difficulties if the problem is not rectified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (LD)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Griffiths. I was not aware of last night's meeting of the Programming Sub-Committee—the necessary card did not reach me—so I apologise for not making my observations then, when it might have slightly more constructive to do so. My only worry about amending the programme motion is that the only times when our mental energies will be devoted to state pensions will be this afternoon and Thursday morning. The rest of the Bill is principally about private sector regulation and the pension protection fund, which is all about private sector provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of our consideration, however, the new clauses selected for debate—new clause 5 on married women's pensions and new clause 6 on overseas pensions—are to be discussed at the final Thursday afternoon sitting after Easter. Had I attended the meeting last night, I would have asked whether it would have made more sense to deal with all state pension issues in one go. We could then have left those mentally, and dealt with private pension issues for the rest of our deliberations, rather than discussing state pensions today and on Thursday, doing nothing on them for a month, and suddenly discussing them again at the fag-end sitting on the final Thursday afternoon, which may get swamped with Government new clauses anyway. We may not even debate those new clauses at all. I will not make a speech on this subject, but I would be grateful for a response from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of this morning's sitting, we could consider whether we might start this afternoon by tweaking our timetable. The new clauses that I mentioned would not have been reached until Thursday anyway, so there would be time to prepare any necessary briefings. I will not go to the wall on this, but that would have been my preference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

winter turns to spring. Having started on that poetic note, I should say that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) made some perfectly reasonable points. I will not rehearse again the circumstances that led us to this situation. I recognise that the order in which we are considering the Bill causes inconvenience to the Committee. I discussed that at our first sitting, and I apologise again to the Committee for that inconvenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the substance of the concerns raised by the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Northavon (Mr. Webb), we can keep a watching brief through the usual channels on whether one final sitting to wrap up new clauses will be sufficient—although logically there will always be one final sitting. That may not be sufficient; if not, we will be sensible and get together to talk about scheduling another sitting or so. I am happy to give that commitment. We are drafting the amendments as quickly as we can, and when we can share them with the Committee, we will. I am happy to give that reassurance to the hon. Member for Eastbourne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will consider the point raised by the hon. Member for Northavon, but I am not promising anything. We cannot consider it this afternoon, but once we have fully understood his concern and considered the details, we may accommodate his wishes on Thursday morning if we can. As I said, I cannot promise that we shall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I mention my concerns first, and the Under-Secretary then helps me, rather than doing things the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather bemused by clause 59. I do not know whether it is just an example of sloppy drafting, but it is bizarre. Some tight rules are, quite properly, set out on the disclosure of information. We talked in previous debates about how important it is to have rules governing that. Opposition Members even tried to introduce amendments about the consequences, such as compensation or damages, if information were disclosed improperly or inappropriately. However, having gone to all that trouble, I find it odd that the clause seems to drive a coach and horses through the rest of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says that despite section 56—currently clause 56, which we debated last week and which is fairly clear—restricted information can still be disclosed
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of enabling or assisting the Board of the Pension Protection Fund to exercise its functions."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps we will get an echo of that when we come to the clauses dealing with the PPF. However, on what basis can it decide to disclose information that would not normally be other than restricted? If it is to have that power, should it not be set out in some detail in this part of the Bill? Is not this an attempt by a draftsman to leave a large opening to allow the previous clauses, particularly clause 56, to be trampled over in a relevant case? I am rather puzzled about the purpose of the clause, and I should be grateful for the Under-Secretary's help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies to the Committee if my voice sounds as if I am speaking through a pillow this morning. The purpose of the clause is fairly straightforward. There was some discussion last week about the relationship between the regulator and the board of the pension protection fund. All that we are seeking to do through the clause is ensure that the information that is transferred is protected. Any restricted information provided to the regulator, or to any person by the regulator, must not be disclosed unless it has the consent of the information provider, or the person to whom it relates. Information provided to the regulator by the Inland Revenue must not be disclosed without prior consent from the commissioners of the Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise.

We are trying to ensure that during the transfer of information between the regulator and the board of the pension protection fund—which the Committee agreed last week was necessary and sensible, because it allowed the PPF to perform its functions and
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
protected members' interests—there is a flow of information with proper safeguards built in to its use and information providers are protected.

Unless a criminal offence is clearly being committed, OPRA with its current powers cannot disclose information, even though there is a clear irregularity. It is because of that example that the Gaming Board is listed in schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We should not pass this sort of provision on the nod, because the principle is important. I am open to all the arguments about tracking down fraudsters and detecting benefit claimants' unjustified claims, but we have to be careful whenever we allow such pooling of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to information moving in one direction, from the Inland Revenue to the regulator. I am not sure where the equivalent provision is for information going from the regulator or the PPF to the Inland Revenue—no doubt the Under-Secretary will able to point that out if it is in the Bill; we may have just passed it. I am sure that there is a two-way street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Under-Secretary tell the Committee what the limits are, in regulation or primary legislation, on the Inland Revenue giving this sort of information to the regulator? I am not suggesting that the new improved regulator should not receive information that is crucial to the issues that it will be tackling, but I assume that Inland Revenue legislation quite properly restricts the nature of the information that the revenue can pass to outside bodies such as the regulator. That is my sole concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall continue our pillow talk on these matters. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that there is a two-way street. As he will be aware, clause 62 largely replicates section 109 of the Pensions Act 1995 and relates to the disclosure of information by the Inland Revenue to the regulator. It provides that the Inland Revenue will not be bound by the restrictions imposed by section 182 of the Finance Act 1989, so long as the information is used by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
regulator to discharge its functions. The regulator must treat information disclosed to it by the Inland Revenue as restricted information. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman's question in part. The regulator must not disclose that information unless the commissioners of the Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise have given permission or—this is only a slight difference—for the purposes of any criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would help the Committee if I gave an example of the type of criminal proceedings that we have in mind. Some offences that relate to pension schemes are not offences under the pensions legislation—theft, for example. We want to ensure that information disclosed by the Inland Revenue to the regulator can be used in criminal proceedings for such offences. I know that the hon. Gentleman will be keen to know what type of tax information may be relevant to the regulator's functions, and I am eager to enlighten him. Tax information could, for example, be details of how many employees an employer has. The hon. Member for Northavon, who has expressed considerable interest in those matters in our earlier proceedings, will know that employee numbers are relevant to enable the regulator to check whether an employer is required to designate a stakeholder scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific point about the gateway to the regulator from the Inland Revenue, I am advised that that is specified in the list in schedule 3—page 177, line 10. Any information that the regulator receives from the Inland Revenue under clause 62 must be treated as restricted information. I hope that that will give sufficient reassurance to the hon. Member for Eastbourne, despite his anxiety about any involvement of the Inland Revenue in the receipt of information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We now get to the meat of today's debate. As we are talking about defamation, I will take this opportunity to put right a prima facie defamatory remark that was made about me in my absence by the Minister last week. He had the temerity to suggest that I might be a Manchester United supporter, the sub-plot being that because I am some sort of effete southerner I would be a natural supporter of Manchester United. I am not a southerner—and as for effete, I will leave that to you to decide, Mr. Griffiths. I am, of course, an enthusiastic supporter of Eastbourne Borough football club, which might not have made it on to the radar screen of many Committee members, but has a great future ahead of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004B001P2I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
The amendment concerns the sole point that I want to raise on the clause. I do not propose to provoke a clause stand part debate, because it is eminently sensible that the regulator should publish reports and that they should be as wide-ranging, detailed and informative as possible. As is clear from the amendment, I am concerned about whether we should simply put the stamp of absolute privilege on anything contained in such a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To anticipate the possible killer point in the Under-Secretary's reply, I must add that a mere glance at section 103 of the Pensions Act 1995 tells us, albeit in a form slightly different from the provision before us, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the law of defamation, the publication of any matter by the Authority shall be absolutely privileged."</p></blockquote>
Far be it for me to claim that the Conservatives have a monopoly of wisdom on those matters. However, I do not think that we as a Committee should simply translate from one piece of legislation to another a measure as important as this without at least giving it proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that there is a major distinction between absolute and qualified privilege. It is a shame that my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) is temporarily absent, because his predecessor gave his name to one of the major recent cases on privilege for parliamentary proceedings. Fortunately that case is not relevant to the point that I am arguing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, do tell us about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary eggs me on, but we have a lot to get through this morning—and given the muffled nature of his egging on, I will move rapidly to my next point before he falls off his chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of hon. Members who are not lawyers, and have not sued or been sued for defamation, I should explain that in one of the leading textbooks on the subject, Peter Carter-Ruck states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"absolute privilege is a complete bar to an action for defamation no matter how false or malicious the words complained of may be"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is in the public interest that people should be able to speak and write with complete freedom unhampered by any underlying fear, real or imaginary, that subsequently they may have to answer for what they have said."</p></blockquote>
He also says that the point about absolute privilege is that, as the term suggests, it is absolute, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not destroyed by malice."</p></blockquote>
I will address the relevance of the term "malice" shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Carter-Ruck also makes the point that areas of activity in which absolute privilege applies are, rightly,
	<br><blockquote><p>"strictly denned and will not be readily extended."</p></blockquote>
It applies to parliamentary and judicial proceedings, to reports of both such proceedings and to certain other defined categories. As I have said, there is a leading recent case concerning parliamentary proceedings, which need not concern us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
Certain other instances are clearly set out in statute. For example, the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 sets out that the holder of that post should enjoy absolute privilege when making reports to the Houses of Parliament; the same goes for the local administration and health service commissioners and the Monopolies Commission—as the Competition Commission was called when Carter-Ruck wrote the book. There is a fairly significant list of bodies that are in a position to issue reports that enjoy absolute privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Carter-Ruck also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even those modern creatures of statute such as the ombudsmen and the Monopolies Commission … are included as a matter of public policy because their functions are in some degree akin to judicial functions."</p></blockquote>
Is the kind of report referred to in clause 63 likely to be comparable to a judicial function? No, because they will simply be reports of the sorts of cases that the regulator has been dealing with. Will the Under-Secretary be a little more forthcoming than the clause about what kind of useful things will usually appear in those reports? There is no basis for arguing for absolute privilege on the strength of the function being quasi-judicial, as described by Carter-Ruck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not apply qualified privilege? There is an onus on the people who are arguing for absolute privilege to show that qualified privilege will not be sufficient. Qualified privilege is quite a hefty defence against a claim for defamation. As Carter-Ruck says, where there is qualified privilege,
	<br><blockquote><p>"an action will not succeed unless the plaintiff can prove that in publishing the words complained of the defendant was actuated by express malice, that is to say by spite or ill-will or some other dominant improper motive … Malice defeats a defence of qualified privilege; it is wholly irrelevant to absolute privilege."</p></blockquote>
Carter-Ruck sets out some of the statutory and other circumstances in which statements, reports, proceedings and reports of proceedings are subject not to absolute privilege but to qualified privilege. The big distinguishing factor between the two forms of privilege is malice. He sets out some examples of statements made in certain classes of report that attract only qualified privilege. I shall not weary the Committee with them, but it is clear that the situation has been examined on a case-by-case basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Defamation Acts of 1952 and 1996 set out clear rules about broadcasts, newspapers and so on. Following the Neill committee in 1991, the law was changed and expanded. As long as a body gives a fair and accurate report of proceedings—providing, for example, a fair and accurate copy of a register or an extract of a register—it happily comes under the rules relating to qualified privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the issue of malice. Carter-Ruck says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Express malice may be defined as a desire to injure the person defamed, or any other wrong or improper motive, which is the dominant motive for the publication."</p></blockquote>
As he says, malice must be the dominant motive for publication. Why on earth should we underwrite a situation in which the new regulator can put into the public domain a report that is, prima facie, defamatory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004B001P2I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
to an individual, and for which the dominant motive is malice? Why did we underwrite such a situation in relation to OPRA in 1995?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Vera Baird 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Redcar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (Lab)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not better for the regulator to be absolutely protected against the sort of action in which the late Robert Maxwell used to specialise? When anything was to be published, he would heave a writ at it. A determination as to whether publication would be malicious is not made for two or three years, until the matter comes to court. In the meantime, publication is held up. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied that deliberately malicious publication by the regulator would be covered by the offence of misfeasance in a public office anyway, so he has nothing to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reassurance from a QC. I would hope that the regulator would not be intimidated by the kind of tactics in which, as the hon. and learned Lady rightly points out, the late Robert Maxwell was a specialist. That consideration should therefore not apply. As for misfeasance, I am sure that there ought to be other penalties for someone in a public office of that kind who issues such a report. However, to come back to the main thread of my argument, we cannot possibly be talking about a serious, focused new regulator even remotely considering putting something into the public domain for which the dominant motive is malice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once qualified privilege is established—we can bring that about in an instant by amending the clause—the onus will lie on the plaintiff to prove express malice. That is quite a serious burden of proof. To put hon. Members' minds at rest, I can tell them that mere negligence or carelessness as to the truth of a statement are irrelevant. As Carter-Ruck said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"what the law requires is not that the privilege should be used carefully but that it should be used honestly",</p></blockquote>
and he referred to the case of Horrocks v. Lowe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am arguing that we should not simply put a chunk of the 1995 legislation into the Bill unprobed. It is possible to envisage circumstances in which serious damage is done by a report from the regulator. I see no particular reason why the kind of person who might suffer significantly if such a report were wrong should be barred from taking any action simply because we attach absolute privilege to the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any argument that says that there is a quasi-judicial function involved. There is simply a totally reasonable requirement, not that the regulator should make sure that the report is right and accurate—that does not cause a problem with qualified privilege—but that there should be no malice involved. Malice should not be the predominant motive in putting such a report into the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his amendment, which I do not consider malicious. It would qualify the regulator's absolute privilege when publishing reports of cases. As he anticipated, I must tell him that the purpose of the absolute privilege is to ensure that when the regulator judges it appropriate—
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
for example, in the interests of schemes or their administrators—it may publish reports of certain cases. Ensuring the regulator's legal privilege in that way means that it will not be prevented from publishing reports out of fear of legal claims against it. Publishing reports may also provide a degree of accountability, as they will evidence the way in which the regulator has fulfilled its functions in response to specific cases. The publishing of reports has proved a useful tool for OPRA, which enjoys an absolute privilege when publishing such reports, and that tool was provided, as the hon. Gentleman said, by section 103 of the now famous Pensions Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will be glad to hear—I am pleased to see that he is sitting down at this moment—that I accept his amendment in principle. However, the nature of the qualification should be detailed in the Bill. I hope that I am encompassing the hon. Gentleman's concerns if I say that the Bill should specify that the publication of any matter will be privileged unless the publication is shown to have been undertaken with malice. That will ensure that the regulator is not deterred from publishing reports so long as it does so in good faith. If the hon. Gentleman is willing to accept that, I shall table an amendment along those lines on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has seen the wisdom of my amendment. I am most grateful for his indication that the principle is acceptable to the Government. I have no particular pride in ownership of this amendment, so if the Minister's advisers tell him that it would be better to spell things out in the Bill, who am I to argue? I am delighted by the Minister's constructive approach, and I look forward to that being replicated in response to future amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are inspired by the Association of British Insurers, which may well have briefed other Committee members too, so they will know what the thrust of my amendments is. Both amendments welcome the idea that there will be codes of practice; no one argues about the principle that codes of practice are worth having. However, in connection with clauses 64 and 65, there should be a draft analysis of the costs and benefits of the codes. That seems only sensible, and in line with best practice. The Bill allows the regulator to issue codes of practice covering a whole range of issues—indeed on any issue, really, as long as it is related to pensions legislation. However, the concern of the Association of British Insurers—and, I am sure, many other outside bodies—is that any such code should reflect the targeted and proportionate regulatory regime that everyone wants, and which the Minister spoke of in this context. Codes should promote good practice among those providing pensions; hence the requirement that, attached to any code, there should be an analysis of the costs and benefits of the regulator's guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In theory—but not, one hopes, in practice—the regulator could use the codes of practice in a way that would both impose large cost burdens on those providing pensions and deliver minimal or nil benefit, in terms of information and security, for the members of those pension schemes. It is worth bearing in mind the principle of proportionality, which is one of the Better Regulation Task Force's five principles of good regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that under the relevant legislation, the Financial Services Authority is required to undertake and publish cost-benefit analyses of proposed rules and guidance. I can think of no good reason why the same rules should not apply to the new regulator—and if my luck holds, perhaps the Minister will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more general point, it is important that any powers or functions with which we endow the regulator have the full support and consent of the industry. It is important that the industry does not feel at all threatened by any potential extra costs attached to any such codes of practice. It is important that we demonstrate to the industry, through this and possibly later amendments, that the regulator will not only look carefully at the need to root out problems in pension schemes, but will ensure that there is not a mass of unnecessary regulation in the codes of practice, providing little benefit and putting extra burdens on business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to the amendments, I shall briefly explain the purpose of the clause, so that we are all clear about its effect. The clause gives the regulator a new power to enable it to issue codes of practice. The codes will contain practical guidance about the way in which the regulator will exercise its
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
functions under the pensions legislation. They will also contain guidance about the standards of conduct and practice that the regulator will expect of people involved with pension schemes—for example, scheme trustees or members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One purpose of enabling the regulator to issue codes of practice is so that we can move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to compliance with legislation. For example, last Thursday, the Committee discussed the whistleblowing duties imposed in clause 45, and the hon. Member for Tatton raised concerns about the use of the words "material significance". He will note that clause 64(2)(c) requires the regulator to issue a code of practice on the duties imposed by clause 45. That code will set out how the regulator interprets "material significance" and explain the type of breach that should be reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, the best route to compliance with the law may vary according to, for example, the size and member profile of the scheme. A code of practice approach will allow flexibility in that regard. That will ensure both that the regulator can operate in an efficient and targeted fashion and that trustees and managers are clear about what the regulator and the law expect of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Codes of practice will augment the proportionate and targeted regulatory approach. They are also a direct response to the recommendations of Alan Pickering's report, which said that a new kind of regulator should
	<br><blockquote><p>"sponsor and monitor the operation of Codes of Practice … However, care must be taken to avoid … Codes that are even more prescriptive and potentially inhibiting than the statutory regulations that we are trying to avoid."</p></blockquote>
The production and publication of certain codes will be mandatory—those are outlined in subsection (2). Other codes may be issued at the discretion of the regulator; those, too, must be published. In addition to publishing codes, the regulator will be able to revise all or part of any code—or, indeed, to ask the Secretary of State to revoke it. We will address the detailed procedures for the production, publication, revision and revocation of codes when we debate clauses 65 and 66, but it is worth anticipating them a little here by saying that the processes that we propose will be subject both to advance consultation and to parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through codes of practice, the regulator will be able to provide clear guidance on its interpretation of pensions law, so that those involved in work-based pension schemes will better understand what the regulator expects them to do. Any failure to comply with a code of practice does not, in itself, mean that a person has failed to comply with the law. As I have explained, codes of practice will set out the regulator's interpretation of certain parts of the pensions legislation. The second part of subsection (5) allows the regulator to say, "You haven't complied with the law. Here is a code of practice that tells you how to comply; please go away and follow it." It simply means that if a person has failed to comply with any provision about which the regulator has issued a code

	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
of practice, the regulator may refer to that code when asking the person to take the action necessary to achieve compliance. It does not mean that the codes of practice can effectively become law through the back door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An improvement notice may be issued only if the regulator is of the opinion that a breach has occurred. It may refer a person to the relevant code of practice. If at the end of the process the person complies with the law—even if that person still has not followed the code of practice to the letter—the important thing, which is the compliance with the law, has happened; therefore, end of story, and end of regulatory intervention. On the other hand, issuing an improvement notice and referring to a code of practice will enable any person to find an easy route to compliance. The message is simple: "Follow the directions of the code of practice and you will be okay."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments would require the regulator to publish an analysis of the costs and benefits of any code when publishing either a draft or a final code of practice. One of the purposes of the code of practice system is to augment the flexible, proportionate and targeted regulatory approach. The system is designed to help minimise the costs of compliance with the law for all types of scheme. What may be right for some types of scheme may not accord with what is right for others, even where the legal requirements are the same for both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the code of practice on trustees' knowledge and understanding as an example. Trustees are required to have an understanding of investment matters. However, the knowledge required for a defined benefit scheme would be different from that required for a defined contribution scheme. In addition, a trustee who performs a more specialist function, such as sitting on an investment subcommittee, should have a deeper understanding. The code of practice may reflect those distinctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say that whether that particular code is indeed framed in that way will be a matter, in the first instance, for the regulator. I use it merely to illustrate a point, which is that the flexibility that the code of practice system allows is designed precisely to help minimise the costs of compliance on all types of schemes. Failure to comply with a code does not automatically mean that a person has failed to comply with the law. If a scheme finds a more cost-effective way of complying with the law than a code suggests, it may use it, as long as it ultimately complies with the legal requirements and—if challenged—is able to show that it has done so. Also, the consultation requirements when drafting a code will give those involved the opportunity to consider any related costs. The regulator's responsibility would be to consider those views and balance them against its aim of providing protection for members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Codes of practice allow a flexible, proportionate and targeted regulatory approach. They provide practical guidance on how to comply with the law and yet allow different schemes to take a different
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
approach, should that be more appropriate to their circumstances. I believe that the concerns that the hon. Member for Eastbourne raises by way of his probing amendments are properly accounted for in the Bill as drafted and I therefore ask him to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I thought that they were properly accounted for in the Bill I would not have tabled the amendments. I am puzzled. The Minister might be able to help me on this and he should feel free to intervene at any moment if he thinks that he can short-circuit matters. As I understand it, he accepts that codes of practice should reflect the principles of flexibility and proportionality in the way that they are drafted. He also accepted that as part of the consultation process it would be open to outside bodies, such as the ABI, to make representations about the likely costs and burdens of such a code of practice; indeed, it would be open to the regulator, the Secretary of State or to both to take account of representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, I do not understand why it is not possible to insert the missing link and say that when the code of practice is first issued in draft for consultation, it should contain, attached to it, a cost-benefit analysis. After all, a regulatory impact assessment is attached to the Bill, which in many ways is more informative than the explanatory notes. Such a measure seems to be something that serious industry bodies would welcome. It goes deeper than that, because before the codes go out to consultation it is necessary for the people who are preparing them to establish in their own minds how burdensome the codes will be and what the balance is between the cost and the benefit that they are seeking to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all happy with the Minister's explanation of why it is not possible to include that measure. It is quite worrying—and I would be quite worried if I was in the ABI'S position—that the Minister cannot accept the amendment. I give notice that we may return to the issue on Report, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the amendments are designed to focus on the consultation process and how it will work. Some of them are home grown and one is inspired by the ABI. Amendments Nos. 248, 249 and 254 are designed to expand and make more specific the provisions regarding who the regulator is supposed to consult when it produces a draft code of practice. Clause 65(2) requires it to consult
	<ol>
	<li>"such persons as it considers appropriate, and</li>
	<li> any other persons the Secretary of State requires it to consult."</li></ol>
I have said my piece in the past and I will not repeat our suspicions about the Secretary of State's role—let alone that of the Treasury—in the legislation. Leaving that aside for a moment, it seems appropriate to us to spell out that as well as those persons "it considers appropriate", the consultation should include representatives of the pensions industry, occupational pension schemes, trade unions and sponsoring employers. It is difficult to see how the Minister could object to the amendment. There is that old argument, which one always comes across, about how much should be included in the Bill and what should not be included. No doubt the Minister will inform us that the regulator would, in any event, consult the relevant groups, and possibly other groups. That is all fine and dandy. However, I would prefer to see it spelled out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 236, which is inspired by the ABI, has slightly more meat on it and is to do with the consultation period. The Government have been accused in the past of going into a "carry on consulting" mode. The duration of some of their consultations on different issues has been quite short. Indeed, sometimes consultations have taken place during the holiday period. It makes sense to ensure that there is a minimum period. We would like there to be a minimum period of 12 weeks for the submission of responses—that seems fair. It is the best part of three months. However, I am not prepared to go to the stake over that. If the Minister accepts the principle and wants to think of a different period to insert, that would be fine, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the amendment would also enshrine criterion No. 1 of the Cabinet Office's code of practice on consultation. One wonders how often that is observed in the consultations undertaken by other Departments. That criterion says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consult widely throughout the process, allowing a minimum of 12 weeks for written consultation at least once during the development of the policy."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would replicate the practice of the Financial Services Authority, which seeks to provide at least 12 weeks for consultation. I failed to mention in the previous debate that the Government have also compelled themselves by legislation to publish cost-benefit analyses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible, as the ABI suggests, for there to be a minimum period for consultation. In some cases there might be a longer period due to the complexity involved. Nevertheless, the basic point is that it is in the interests of the regulator and the Government to ensure that all those who have something to contribute should have the fullest possible say on these draft codes. It is sensible and reasonable for there to be a 12-week period. It is difficult to think of any code of practice that would need to be introduced so urgently that that kind of period for consultation would not be allowed. Assuming that the regulator and the Secretary of State will be open to sensible comments and suggestions, one hopes that each code would be improved as a result of this process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put it bluntly, I cannot think of any reasonable objection to the amendment. I hope that the Minister, who has already shown his broad-mindedness once this morning, will accept it without further ado.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explain briefly the effect of the clause before speaking to each hon. Member's amendment. Committee members will have noted that the clause ensures that there is proper parliamentary scrutiny over any codes of practice issued by the regulator under clause 64. It provides that there must be proper consultation and publication of draft codes. I shall return to that in a moment. When any comments have been considered, the code must be sent to the Secretary of State, who, if he approves it, must lay it before Parliament for the recommended period of 40 days, not including periods when the House is not sitting. Unless by resolution of either House Parliament objects, the Secretary of State can appoint by order a day on which the code can come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 248 would require the regulator to consult representatives of the pensions industry, occupational pension schemes, trade unions and sponsoring employers when publishing a draft code of practice. Although the clause does not stipulate it, the groups mentioned in the amendment are precisely those that I suspect that the regulator will consult. One reason why that is not stipulated is that it may not be proper in every case for the regulator to consult all those groups. For example, it may not be appropriate to consult employers' groups on trustees' duties to report late payments by employers. The legislation on that matter is clear. Currently, all such payments must be paid by the 19th day of the month following the month in which the payments fall due. A further reason is that although these are the types of group that the regulator will consult, there are others, such as the representatives of actuaries and auditors, who may also be consulted. The legislation cannot be exhaustive; to mention some groups and not others
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004B001P2I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
would suggest that the former had undue prominence or authority, which might not be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 236 would require the consultation period for each draft code to be a minimum of 12 weeks. Although I understand that that suggestion might appear reasonable at first blush, it may in fact place an unnecessary constraint on the regulator in particular, urgent situations. In discussing clause 64, I mentioned a possible scenario in which the tribunal's determination might result in the regulator deciding that a code of practice should urgently be replaced. In those circumstances, a three-month minimum consultation period might not be appropriate and might put members' benefits at risk as a result of trustees' and managers' uncertainty about what would be expected of them in the interim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that I do not anticipate that such circumstances will arise. However, as my colleague and I have said, our purpose in designing the legislative framework for the regulator is to balance certainty against flexibility and adaptability. No Committee member wants to create another situation in which legislation places unnecessary restrictions on the regulator and prevents it from properly doing its job, which is to protect members' benefits. The system of codes of practice provides the necessary clarity and certainty for the regulator community and gives sufficient flexibility to ensure that the regulator may take action to protect members, even if circumstances arise in future that none of us is able to foresee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 249 and 254 would remove the Secretary of State's ability to require the regulator to consult any additional persons. Again, the provision is about balance. I do not expect the regulator not to consult the groups appropriate to each particular code. However, if such a situation were to arise, the subsection would merely provide an easy mechanism to remedy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained, each code of practice is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. If any hon. Member considered that the regulator had not consulted appropriately during the drafting process or that the Secretary of State had made an inappropriate direction about who should be consulted, they would have the opportunity to do something about it. I suggest that hon. Members wait for those unlikely circumstances to arise rather than restrict the flexible approach that we propose at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the clause provides the procedure for the issue and publication of codes of practice with the necessary and appropriate levels of scrutiny, flexibility and openness. The regulator must publish the code as it considers appropriate. Amendment No. 250 would remove the subsection allowing the regulator to publish any code in a way appearing to it to be appropriate. Enabling that flexibility allows for publication by either—or both—paper and electronic means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the amendments can be criticised at all on grounds of practicality. The Minister seems to accept the fundamental principles behind them, although perhaps he would like to tinker with the list of consultees. The industry will be puzzled about why the principles at least could not be accepted. However, I do not want to detain the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is like a coiled spring, waiting to leap on my arguments about the amendments and hack them to pieces. However, if he can contain himself, I shall explain my intentions, which, hopefully, approximate to the intentions set out in his speaking notes. Clause 65(10) and clause 68(2) have almost the same wording. It is curious that, having gone to all the trouble to arrange for the regulator to publish draft codes of practice or draft statements of procedure, both of which are important for a range of organisations, the clause says in a limp way that it is up to the regulator to publish a code
	<br><blockquote><p>"appearing to it to be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
What is behind that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only a limited number of ways of publishing codes. The regulator may stick them on the website. It is bound to have a website; everyone does these days. I do, and I am sure that the Minister does, too. I hope that hard copies will be available for old-fashioned people who like the feel of paper. What possible range of options can the regulator be looking at when deciding how to publish the draft codes or the draft statements of procedure? I hope that the Minister will enlighten me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. It might be useful to repeat what I said earlier about enabling flexibility—the corner-stone of our approach—that allows for publication by either or both paper and electronic means.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows that a code that relates to duties of, for example, actuaries may also be sent to the appropriate professional organisations for onward distribution to their members. Clearly, we would not go to the trouble of specifying the need for codes without ensuring that they were published and distributed properly. As members of the Committee will appreciate, it makes no sense for any code to be published in such a way that those to whom it is directed are unaware of its provisions. That would not suit us, the regulator or the regulated community, and neither would it be in the interests of those whom ultimately we want to help. Given those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause was bound to provoke me because it deals with the Secretary of State interfering again in the regulator's business. I cannot begin to understand why the Secretary of State should have a power to revoke a code of practice. I accept that the regulator should have the power to revoke one of its codes of practice, but it is a little wishy-washy to refer to the revocation being made with the consent of the regulator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophical difference between the two sides has surfaced before. The Government are setting up a gleaming, shining new regulator with new powers and functions and a probably much-enhanced staff and budget. The Conservatives believe that we should let it get on with it. Having set it up and given it the best possible start in life, the Secretary of State should not start micro-managing such matters. It mystifies me why the Secretary of State should have a view on a code of practice, other than that of any essential consultee, as Secretaries of State have better things to do. The clause should be removed altogether and it should be made clear that the regulator can revoke its code of practice. The Minister mentioned a possible scenario—it is difficult to credit—that something might need to be done in an emergency. It is the regulator, which should know its own business, not a politician, that should be in charge of this sort of issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Nigel Waterson—I am sorry, I meant Mr. Malcolm Wicks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree sometimes, Mr. Griffiths. Clauses 64 and 65 place a duty on the regulator to
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
issue the codes of practice and to consult. The Secretary of State must lay codes of practice before Parliament as they will be commenced by order of the Secretary of State. Clause 66 permits that Minister to revoke codes, also by order. Opposition Members expressed their concern that that gives too much power to the Secretary of State, and I hope I can reassure them that that is not the case. The procedure is designed to enable a flexible approach to legislation; it was one of the underlying purposes of allowing the regulator to issue codes of practice in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, such an approach must still have appropriate parliamentary scrutiny, which is why codes can be stopped by resolution of either House. As codes are commenced by order, they must also be revoked by order and the procedure ensures that there will be no confusion about whether codes of practice or any particular version of a code are current. An order to revoke a code may not be made without the regulator's consent, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged. That is what subsection (2) is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will ensure that we strike precisely the right balance between the regulator staying at arm's length from Government and retaining sufficient parliamentary accountability for its actions. It should also allay any Opposition concerns about the Government's ability to interfere in the regulator's activities. I hope that that reassures the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clauses we have just agreed to set out the standard and special procedures that the regulator will use. The purpose of specifying the different procedures is to ensure that the regulator's powers, which are varied, are nevertheless used proportionately and fairly, and that they comply with the requirements of the Human Rights Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004B001P2I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
Clause 70 relates to the standard procedure, which is fairly straightforward. Since we have not yet discussed either the standard or the special procedure before discussing the Government amendments, I shall explain the standard procedure. If the regulator has a case in which there is no immediate risk to scheme assets or members' benefits, and the regulator intends to exercise one of its regulatory functions, it must tell those likely to be directly affected by the regulatory action. Those affected will vary, depending on the action. They will be invited to make representations about the proposed action. The regulator will consider those representations and tell the individuals concerned what it has decided to do through the issue of a determination notice, which will be published probably electronically under clause 63 so that it will be available to any interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulator cannot take the action, however, until after the period for making a reference to the tribunal has expired, except in certain cases detailed in subsection 5. There are many Government amendments to the clause, which are largely technical, and correct drafting errors and ensure that the references to the Pensions Act 1995 are correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My questions for the Under-Secretary boil down to this: how special is the special procedure? It is clear from the guts of the clause—subsection (2)—that the regulator has to be satisfied that it is necessary to exercise the functions listed immediately if he
	<br><blockquote><p>"considers it likely that if a warning notice were to be given there would be, an immediate risk to … the interests of members … or … the assets of … a scheme".</p></blockquote>
Will the Under-Secretary say—so far as he can, given how distant the operation of the clause is—how the clause would operate in practice? How rare would use of the special procedure be? Could he say a little more about what kind of situations he had in mind when drafting the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pick up on the hon. Gentleman's comments. The Under-Secretary has helpfully supplied members of the Committee with a briefing note on general and special procedures. It flags up the fact that the procedures are quite a drastic step. The note says that actions taken under the clause may temporarily, but seriously, impinge on the human rights of any affected person. The note goes on to state that that can be justified when balanced against the risk to members' interests, but that the line needs to be trodden carefully. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, it would be helpful if the Committee could be told how often such a procedure might be required. Is there a parallel in the existing regulatory framework? If not, how new is this? For how long might the provisions apply in any particular case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. This might seem churlish, and it may be the fault of my office, but I did not have the benefit of that briefing note—just as the hon. Gentleman did not have the benefit of an invitation to the Programming Sub-Committee. I do not know how the note was supposed to get to me; I am sure that my life will go on much as before without reading it, but it would be nice if I could be given another copy if I have lost the first one—or if it has been eaten by my dog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of order, but we have heard it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Eastbourne if he did not receive that briefing note. We will make sure that he receives a copy as soon as
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
possible. However, it is probable that life will continue much as before, with or without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three types of situation are provided for under this part of the Bill. The first situation is where there is an immediate risk; I think that the Committee accepts that in those circumstances the determinations panel must act immediately in order to protect members' interests. The second situation is when the regulator has given a warning notice but, before considering representations, decides that there is an immediate risk—in other words, new information becomes available. The third situation is where the regulator issues a warning notice, considers a representation, and decides to act immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Northavon said, the first two types of situation are obvious—when the regulator receives information and must act immediately, or when the regulator has sent a warning notice but receives information while waiting for a response that makes it reassess the situation and determine there is an immediate risk. The third situation is provided for by Government amendments Nos. 199 to 202. We have considered them, but they may need a little further explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the regulator has received an application from the members to appoint a trustee because they believe that the current trustee is too closely connected to the employer, but there is no evidence of behaviour likely to put the scheme assets or members' benefits at risk. The regulator will then follow the standard procedure and issue warning notices giving the parties a time within which to respond—let us say 14 days. If on day two the regulator received a fax from a member-nominated trustee saying that he had just heard that the managing director—who was also a trustee—had asked the bank to transfer a large sum of money out of the pension scheme urgently, the regulator would have to act that day. The regulator could not wait until the expiration of 14 days, when all responses will be received, before taking action. The functions that the regulator can exercise immediately are detailed in clause 71, and I am sure the Committee agrees that it may be necessary for it to exercise them immediately, to protect members' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confirm that any regulatory functions prescribed under clause 4(1) must be prescribed by the Secretary of State and will be subject to the normal parliamentary procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members were trying to get a feel for the frequency with which the powers might be used—although I appreciate that any estimate will be somewhat speculative—and also whether they are new powers, or whether they mirror anything in existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Griffiths; the hon. Gentleman raised those questions and I should have responded to them. There is nothing new in this, but we are setting it out in legislation. OPRA's emergency procedures are already set out, and they are reflected in the Bill. We do not expect there to be a significant number of cases; there are an average of 10 emergency cases per year, according to OPRA's experience.

	<div class='title'>SPECIAL PROCEDURE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 253, in
	<br><blockquote><p>clause 73, page 47, line 27, leave out</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'as soon as reasonably practicable'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>and insert 'within seven days'.</p></blockquote>
In useful exchanges on previous clauses, we established that the special procedure will be used sparingly—30 cases a year was cited by OPRA. In any event, I think that we can agree that it will not happen often; but when it does, it will have significant consequences. The Minister graphically described the obvious example—one that is not unfamiliar—of large sums of money being transferred out of a pension fund and the need for rapid action. In any event, the special procedure will be applied only in serious situations. It is therefore even more important that the compulsory review set out in clause 73 should happen quickly, as events may move fast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the special procedure, but the use of words like "immediate" and phrases such as "immediate risk" and "warning notice" may warn the villains that the regulator is on to them. Subsection (2) uses the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practical".</p></blockquote>
That seems a bit feeble, which is why I propose instead the phrase "within seven days". Given the seriousness and urgency inherent in such situations, it is only right that all other issues be put to one side while they are dealt with urgently. Seven days seems appropriate in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already discussed the standard and special procedures. One of the vital safeguards for those directly affected by a function exercised under the special procedure is the compulsory review, and it is the review to which amendment No. 253 relates. As the hon. Gentleman explained, a compulsory review must be held
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to change that to "within seven days".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the meaning of the phrase that the amendment seeks to omit; I have explained that it means exactly what it says. The purpose of the compulsory review is to allow those directly affected to make representations. If there is insufficient time for them to do so, the review will have little purpose. Allowing the review to take place as soon as reasonably practicable will ensure that a
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
balance can be struck between reviewing the decision as soon as possible and allowing directly affected parties sufficient time to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were to be accepted, it would mean that those who wanted to take legal advice, or who wanted to obtain evidence to present to the compulsory review, would have less than seven days to so. In practice, they would be prevented from making full representations to the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that we share his objective—that the procedure should be brought into effect as speedily as possible—but that we need flexibility in order to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to use the protection built into the provision. I therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the Minister's explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 237, in
	<br><blockquote><p>clause 73, page 47, line 32, leave out paragraph (c).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 242, in
	<br><blockquote><p>clause 77, page 50, line 12, leave out paragraph (c).</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would remove similar wording from clauses 73 and 77. It is a short and important point, but I hope that it is obvious. I can see the point of confirming, varying or revoking a determination. However, clause 73(3)(c) and clause 77(6)(c) would allow the substitution of a different determination or order. The cleanest and most appropriate thing to do would be to go back to the start and, ab initio, have a new application and reference and start from scratch, rather than substituting. To substitute a different determination would be a wide-ranging power. It is not appropriate to do that in what amounts to a review or appeal procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are now clear, the determinations panel has a number of powers available to it at compulsory review stage. It may confirm, vary or revoke any decision, substitute a different decision, or deal with matters arising from the review as if those had arisen on the original determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 237 would remove the provision that on a review the determinations panel may substitute a different determination order, notice or direction. Amendment No. 242 would remove the provision that the tribunal can direct the regulator to substitute a different determination order, notice or direction. This provision will allow a different decision to be substituted when representations have been received, such as when a trustee is to be appointed, rather than a freezing order being imposed. However, safeguards are provided. Subsection (5) provides that should the decision of the review be to exercise a different regulatory function, that function cannot have immediate effect unless notice has been given to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004B001P2I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
directly affected parties and representations have been considered, or, under subsection (6), it is a function that can be exercised by special procedure and is necessary because there is an immediate risk to scheme members' benefits or assets. Previous Government amendments have added to these safeguards.

	<br><blockquote><p>clause 74, page 48, line 35, at end insert</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'including sponsoring employers of any such schemes.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would tighten up the wording of clause 74(2) to make it clear that among the persons whose interests the regulator needs to consider in such circumstances are the sponsoring employers of any such schemes. That is a blindingly obvious statement. I have no doubt that the Government wish to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that query. I reassure him that a sponsoring employer will be covered by these provisions. The clause requires the regulator, when it is deciding to exercise its regulatory functions, including their review, to take into account the interests of the generality of scheme members who will be affected by its actions, and the interests of other persons whom it considers will be directly affected. It ensures that the regulator acts fairly and proportionately when exercising its regulatory functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add an automatic duty to consider the interests of employers. I assure the hon. Gentleman that if a sponsoring employer were directly
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
affected, the clause would provide that its interests would be considered. However, the employer is not always directly affected. Indeed, the decision about who was directly affected would depend on the circumstances. If the regulator is appointing an additional trustee and the fees are to be paid by the employer, the employer would be directly affected and its interests would be considered. Similarly, if the regulator determines to freeze or wind up a scheme, the employer would be directly affected and its interests would be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the regulator imposes a penalty on the trustees, the employer may not be directly affected by the decision. The hon. Gentleman should note that even if the determinations panel does not deem an employer to be directly affected, the employer may appeal to the pensions regulator tribunal to be a directly affected party under clause 70(3) if the employer wishes to make a reference.

The reason for those exceptions is that there is a simpler method of achieving the same result.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put my cards on the table: we believe that there is no need for a pensions regulator tribunal. We have made the point more than once that a vast bureaucracy is being created; there will be a regulator, an ombudsman, the determinations panel—that will probably bring the hon. Member for Northavon to his feet and bring back happy memories of previous debates—and now a pensions regulator tribunal. In the significant or serious cases in which further legal challenge is appropriate, a simple reference to the High Court would probably do the trick, rather than having yet another organisation, with all its cost implications, such as staffing and so on, building up a body of precedent and procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as it appears that we are stuck with the proposal, at least for the moment, the amendments are designed to clarify how the rules on its parliamentary proceedings are to be made. I do not see why the Lord Chancellor, or whatever he is called nowadays, should be involved. An expanded version of schedule 4 could set out all the relevant procedure; assuming that we accept schedule 4,I do not understand why subsection (5) should go out of its way to provide that it does not have any effect on the Lord Chancellor's powers under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have the new body—I do not think that we should—it should be clear from the outset what it will do and how it will do it and the Lord Chancellor should not get involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly surprised by the hon. Gentleman's approach. The concept of a tribunal is fairly well established and I will argue for it. Clause 76 provides for the establishment of the new pensions regulator tribunal. The amendments seek to remove the provisions that allow the Lord Chancellor to make rules about its proceedings. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Lord Chancellor still exists; I saw him the other day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will no doubt remember Sir Andrew Leggatt's report, "Tribunals for Users—One System, One Service". My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns) is an authority on it. He may or may not want to speak about it later—probably not. It recommended a unified tribunal system under the Department for Constitutional Affairs. It was welcomed by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
Government, who last year announced that there would be such a system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for those reasons, and to ensure the independence and impartiality of the pensions regulator tribunal, that we consider this arrangement to be the most suitable, as it allows the tribunal to be run by the Court Service. As hon. Members are probably aware, the tribunal that reviews decisions of the Financial Services Authority, the financial services and markets tribunal, is also run by the Court Service, and the Lord Chancellor is empowered to make rules for it. It is likely that the pensions regulator tribunal will be based with that tribunal and will use the same premises, support staff and tribunal members—although there might be some further appointments of members with pension knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Lord Chancellor is not required to consult on rules made under the clause, there was consultation on the rules of procedure for the financial services and markets tribunal and we anticipate that that will be the case for the tribunal that we are now proposing.

I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is important that the tribunal is run by the Court Service and that—as recommended by the Leggatt report—it sits within the auspices of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. We want to make it clear that in terms of proper procedure and human rights we are doing the right thing when decisions are challenged. Therefore, a tribunal is important. Despite the hon. Gentleman's misgivings, I wonder whether he might consider withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have misgivings but I am sure that I will get over them. I have fond memories of Sir Andrew Leggatt, if not of his report. I remember on one occasion flying him out to Tokyo, where he sat as a High Court judge in the British embassy compound in respect of a large piece of litigation that I was handling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; a large body of QCs, juniors, solicitors and all manner of people were flying out for this litigation. He was a charming dinner companion. His report seems to have slipped through the net in terms of my preparation. Therefore, suitably covered in embarrassment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning's proceedings show that the Opposition were sensible to suggest that we did not need an extra sitting to discuss the regulator under this part of the Bill.

	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
hope that that proposal commends itself to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Malcolm Wicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would remove the provision whereby a directly affected party can appeal to the Court of Appeal or, in Scotland, the Court of Session only with the permission of the tribunal, the Court of Appeal or the Court of Session. I assure hon. Members that there is nothing unusual about that provision. Only in certain cases is permission to appeal not required—for example, if the appeal is against a committal order, a refusal to grant habeas corpus, or a secure accommodation order. The requirement for permission to appeal reflects the rules of most other tribunals and proceedings in county courts and the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the tribunal refuses permission to appeal, directly affected parties may apply to the Court of Appeal or the Court of Session for permission. Permission to appeal will be given only if the court considers that the appeal would have a real prospect of success or there is some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard. There is then a further right of appeal to the House of Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
