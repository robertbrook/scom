	<li>the cleaning-up of a site to which this section applies, or of a related site,</li></ol>
includes the financial responsibility for the decommissioning or operation of the installation or facility, or for the cleaning-up.</li>
	<li>This section applies to an installation, site or facility which becomes a designated installation, site or facility at a time when the person with control of it is—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>a Crown appointee;</li>
	<li>the UKAEA;</li>
	<li>a wholly-owned subsidiary of the UKAEA;</li>
	<li>any other publicly owned company which was so owned on 4th July 2002; or</li>
	<li>a wholly-owned subsidiary of such a company.</li>

	<li>the NDA has financial responsibility for decommissioning, operating or cleaning up an installation, site or facility, and</li>
	<li>a person other than the NDA is the person with control of it,</li></ol>
that other person is not to be, or to be capable of becoming, liable to meet any of the costs of doing the things that are required to be secured by the NDA in the discharge of its responsibilities in relation to that installation, site or facility.</li>
	<li>Accordingly, where the NDA has the financial responsibility in the case of an installation, site or facility—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>it must not impose charges on the person with control of the installation, site or facility in respect of anything mentioned in subsection (3);</li>
	<li>it must meet the costs of the doing by that person of anything that he is authorised or required to do by virtue of section 20;</li>
	<li>it must also meet the costs of the performance by him of his duty to comply with directions under section 21; and</li>
	<li>that person is not to be required for any purpose to make, or to continue to make, financial provision for meeting costs which fall, by virtue of its financial responsibility, to be met by the NDA.</li>

	<li>It shall be the duty of the NDA for the purpose of discharging its financial responsibilities to make all such arrangements as it thinks fit for securing that the person with control of the installation, site or facility is able to meet, as they become due, all his liabilities to persons other than the NDA in respect of matters for which the NDA has financial responsibility or that those liabilities are otherwise discharged.</li>

	<li>The NDA is to be taken to have discharged its responsibility for meeting costs under this section if it is satisfied that those costs—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>have been met by another person directly or indirectly out of money provided by Parliament; or</li>
	<li>are to be so met.</li>
</ol>
	<li>The preceding provisions of this section have effect in relation to an installation, site or facility subject to the terms of—</li>

	<li>Where a loan is made to the NDA by the Secretary of State—
	<ol>
	<li>the loan must be repaid to him at such times and by such methods as he may determine; and</li>
	<li>interest on the loan must be paid to him at such rates and at such times as he may determine;</li></ol>

</ol>
	<li>The authorising authority must, on receipt of the application (but subject to directions under section 25 and to subsection (6)), send a copy of the application to every local authority in whose area radioactive waste may be disposed of under the authorisation to which the application relates.</li>
	<li>Before granting the application, the authorising authority must (subject to subsection (6)) consult everyone whom it would have been required to consult under section 16(4A) and (5) if—</li>

</ol>
	<li>The authorising authority may proceed with the application without—

	<li>sending a copy of the application to a local authority mentioned in subsection (4), or</li>
	<li>consulting an authority or body mentioned in section 16(5) about the proposed transfer,</li></ol>
if it appears to the authorising authority that arrangements for the disposal of radioactive waste are unlikely to be changed, as a result of the transfer, in a way that would be of interest to that authority or body.</li>
	<li>The authorising authority may grant the application if, and only if, it is satisfied—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that the transferee has or will have operational control over the disposals to which the transferred authorisation will relate;</li>
	<li>that he is able and willing to ensure compliance with the limitations and conditions of the authorisation that he will hold if the application is granted; and</li>
	<li>that no other grounds exist on which it would be reasonable to refuse to grant the application.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Where the authorising authority grants the application, it must—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>fix the date from which the transfer applied for is to have effect;</li>
	<li>furnish the transferee with a certificate containing all material particulars of the authorisation he holds as a result of the transfer;</li>
	<li>in the case of a partial transfer, furnish the transferor with a similar certificate as respects the authorisation he holds as a result of the transfer; and</li>
	<li>subject to directions under section 25, send a copy of the certificate furnished to the transferee, and of any certificate furnished to the transferor—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>to every local authority in whose area radioactive waste may be disposed of under the authorisation to which the certificate relates; and</li>
	<li>to every person consulted about the transfer under so much of subsection (5) as requires consultation in accordance with section 16(5).</li>
</ol></ol>
	<li>The time fixed as the time from which the transfer is to have effect must be not less than twenty-eight days after the day (if any) on which the authorising authority, when it fixes that time, expects copies of the certificates mentioned in paragraph (d) of subsection (8) to be sent out in accordance with that paragraph.</li>

</ol></p>
	<div class='schedule_sub_title'>Initial strategy</div> <!-- schedule_sub_title -->
	<p>2 The NDA must—

before the end of the twelve months beginning with the commencement of section 14.</p>
	<div class='schedule_sub_title'>Strategy reviews and revisions</div> <!-- schedule_sub_title -->
	<p>3 (1) The NDA must carry out and complete a review of its strategy before the end of each review period.

	<li>If, in consequence of such a review, the NDA decides that it is necessary to revise its strategy, it must submit the draft of its proposed revision for approval.</li>
	<li>If, in consequence of such a review, the NDA decides that it is unnecessary to revise its strategy, it must submit its current strategy for the renewal of the strategy's approval.</li>
	<li>The obligation, following a review, to submit—

	<li>the draft revision of the NDA's strategy prepared in consequence of the review, or</li>
	<li>the strategy the approval of which is for renewal,</li></ol>
is an obligation to submit it as soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the review.</li>
	<li>The NDA may revise its strategy otherwise than in consequence of a review.</li>

	<li>no such interference with any interest or right,</li></ol>
as there would be, in the case of a transaction apart from this Act, by reason of a provision falling within sub-paragraph (3).</li>

	<li>In particular, a nuclear transfer scheme may make provision, in relation to transfers in accordance with the scheme—</li>

	<li>between a transferee and a transferor,</li></ol>
to be referred to such arbitration as may be specified in or determined under the scheme.</li>
	<li>Where a person is entitled, in consequence of a nuclear transfer scheme, to possession of a document relating in part to the title to land or other property in England and Wales, or to the management of such land or other property—</li>

	<li>section 64 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c. 20) (production and safe custody of documents) shall have effect accordingly, and on the basis that the acknowledgement did not contain an expression of contrary intention.</li>

	<li>the appropriate pension scheme authority;</li>
	<li>the Treasury; and</li>
	<li>such persons as appear to him to represent the persons who will be entitled to pension protection in relation to the scheme.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Before the coming into force of such a transfer scheme, the Secretary of State must satisfy himself that every person entitled to pension protection in relation to the scheme will be entitled, by virtue of the employment that he will hold after the relevant time—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>to exercise an option of becoming a participant in an appropriate pension scheme; or</li>
	<li>in the case of a person to whom paragraph 9(7)(c) will apply immediately before the relevant time, to exercise such an option on or before attaining the age or fulfilling the condition in question.</li>
</ol>
	<li>The Secretary of State's duty under sub-paragraph (2) is owed to every person who is entitled to pension protection in relation to the transfer scheme.</li>
	<li>In the case of a person to whom paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii) applies, the references in sub-paragraph (2) to a person being entitled to exercise an option are to be construed as references to a person being entitled to exercise an option if his employer exercises the entitlement mentioned in paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii).</li>
	<li>For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), a pension scheme is an appropriate pension scheme in relation to a person if the Secretary of State is satisfied that—
	<ol>
	<li>taking into account the other benefits (if any) that are conferred on or made available to that person as a result of the employment that he will hold after the relevant time, and</li>
	<li>taking the benefits that are available under the provisions of that pension scheme as a whole,</li></ol>
the benefits that are available under those provisions are no less favourable than the benefits available under the provisions (taken as a whole) of the nuclear pension scheme in respect of which he is entitled to protection under this Part of this Schedule.</li>
	<li>In sub-paragraph (5) the reference to the scheme in respect of which a person is entitled to protection under this Part of this Schedule is a reference to—

	<li>in other cases, the scheme by reference to which paragraph 9(7) applied to him immediately before the time that was the relevant time in relation to him on the first occasion on which he was owed such a duty;</li></ol>
and the reference, in relation to such a person, to the provisions of that scheme is a reference to its provisions as in force immediately before the time specified in sub-paragraph (7).</li>
	<li>That time is—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>in a case falling within sub-paragraph (6)(a), the relevant time; or</li>
	<li>in a case falling within sub-paragraph (6)(b), the relevant time in relation to the person on the first occasion on which he was owed a duty under either sub-paragraph (2) or paragraph 11(3).</li>
</ol>
	<li>Where a person—

	<li>is a participant in a non-nuclear pension scheme by virtue of the exercise of an option in a case in which the Secretary of State discharged his duty to that person under sub-paragraph (2) by reference to that option, or</li>
	<li>is or will become entitled to exercise an option to become a participant in such a pension scheme in a case in which the Secretary of State discharged his duty to that person under sub-paragraph (2) by reference to that entitlement,</li></ol>
this Part of this Schedule shall have effect in relation to that person as if that scheme were a nuclear pension scheme.</li>
	<li>Sub-paragraph (8) does not apply in relation to a person to whom paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii) applied when the Secretary of State discharged his duty to that person under sub-paragraph (2) unless the person's employer exercises the entitlement mentioned in paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii).</li>

	<li>The NDA's duty under sub-paragraph (3) is owed to every person who is entitled to pension protection in relation to the transfer arrangements.</li>
	<li>In the case of a person to whom paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii) applies, the references in sub-paragraph (3) to a person being entitled to exercise an option are to be construed as references to a person being entitled to exercise an option if his employer exercises the entitlement mentioned in paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii).</li>
	<li>For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3), a pension scheme is an appropriate pension scheme in relation to a person if the NDA is satisfied that—

the benefits that are available under those provisions are no less favourable than the benefits available under the provisions (taken as a whole) of the nuclear pension scheme in respect of which he is entitled to protection under this Part of this Schedule.</li>
	<li>In sub-paragraph (6) the reference to the scheme in respect of which a person is entitled to protection under this Part of this Schedule is a reference to—

	<li>in the case of a person who has not previously been owed a duty under either sub-paragraph (3) or paragraph 10(2), the scheme by reference to which paragraph 9(7) will apply to him immediately before the relevant time; and</li>
	<li>in other cases, the scheme by reference to which paragraph 9(7) applied to him immediately before the time that was the relevant time in relation to him on the first occasion on which he was owed such a duty;</li></ol>
and the reference, in relation to such a person, to the provisions of that scheme is a reference to its provisions as in force immediately before the time specified in sub-paragraph (8).</li>
	<li>That time is—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>in a case falling within sub-paragraph (7)(a), the relevant time; or</li>
	<li>in a case falling within sub-paragraph (7)(b), the relevant time in relation to the person on the first occasion on which he was owed a duty under either sub-paragraph (3) or paragraph 10(2).</li>
</ol>
	<li>Where a person—
	<ol>
	<li>is a participant in a non-nuclear pension scheme by virtue of the exercise of an option in a case in which the NDA discharged its duty to that person under sub-paragraph (3) by reference to that option, or</li>
	<li>is or will become entitled to exercise an option to become a participant in such a pension scheme in a case in which the NDA discharged its duty to that person under sub-paragraph (3) by reference to that entitlement,</li></ol>
this Part of this Schedule shall have effect in relation to that person as if that scheme were a nuclear pension scheme.</li>
	<li>Sub-paragraph (9) does not apply in relation to a person to whom paragraph 9(5)(d)(ii) applied when the NDA discharged its duty to that person under

that the scheme will be an appropriate pension scheme for the purposes of paragraph 10 or 11.</p>

	<li>The asset shall be treated as disposed of to the NDA or (as the case may be) to its subsidiary for a consideration of such amount as would secure that, on the disposal, neither a gain nor a loss accrues to the transferor.</li>

make a scheme under this Schedule for the transfer of property, rights and liabilities from the old energy company to the new energy company (an "energy transfer scheme").</p>
	<p>	<ol>
	<li>Such a scheme may be made only at a time when the energy administration order is in force in relation to the old energy company.</li>

	<li>The Secretary of State may modify an energy transfer scheme before approving it, but only modifications to which both the old energy company and the new energy company have consented may be made.</li>
	<li>In deciding whether to approve an energy transfer scheme, the Secretary of State must have regard, in particular, to—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the public interest; and</li>
	<li>the effect the scheme is likely to have (if any) upon the interests of third parties.</li>

	<li>An application for permission must be accompanied by all such information as may be required by appeal rules.</li>
	<li>Those rules may require information contained in the application to be verified by a statement of truth.</li>

</ol>
	<li>The Commission's decision on an application for permission must be made before the end of ten working days following the day on which it received it.</li>
	<li>The Commission's decision whether to grant permission is to be taken by an authorised member of the Commission.</li>
	<li>A decision to grant permission may be made subject to conditions.</li>
	<li>Those conditions may include—</li>

	<li>is a person who would have been entitled, at the time of the application, to make his own application to the Commission for permission to bring an appeal against the decision in question.</li>
</ol>
	<li>A person who gives a notice asking to become a party to an appeal must send GEMA—</li>

	<li>A member of the Commission is not to give a direction under this paragraph if he considers that it would prevent the determination of the appeal within the period allowed by paragraph 6 to do so.</li>

	<li>an application for its exercise has been made by the applicant for permission or by another person with interests or functions that entitle him, or would have entitled him, to appeal against the decision;</li>
	<li>the applicant for the exercise of the power would incur significant costs if the consent were to have effect, or to continue to have effect, before the determination of the appeal; and</li>
	<li>the balance of convenience does not otherwise require effect to be given to the consent pending that determination.</li>
</ol>
	<li>That power is exercisable at any time before the determination of the appeal.</li>
	<li>A person making an application under this paragraph must notify GEMA.</li>
