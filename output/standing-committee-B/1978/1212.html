	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONSTITUTION ETC. OF NATIONAL BOARDS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gerard Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment no. 60, in page 17, line 25, leave out "2" and insert "1".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment no. 61, in page 17, line 36, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'no order shall be made under this paragraph unless a draft of the order has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have put down this amendment because we believe that it is important for the new body to get on with its task as soon as possible, and a number of people have put to us that it would be able to get on more rapidly than is suggested at the moment. I should like to read from one of the letters that has been sent to us. It states
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the two year period set out in Schedule 2 Part I of the Bill … is unnecessarily long and will invite delay. Given that the Central Council will be making important decisions during its first years of existence regarding the scope and framework of nurse training, we believe that elections should therefore be held as speedily as possible so that elected bodies and not bodies appointed by the Secretary of State should take the decisions."</p></blockquote>
Those words should be of particular importance to the Minister because they come from the National Union of Public Employees, and it is on that body's recommendation that we have tabled this amendment for a shorter period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again and again as we discuss the Bill we have views being put to us that too much power is being left in the hands of the Secretary of State, and that the new body will not be given sufficient freedom to get on with its task, and get on with it fast enough. It is on that basis that we have tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment no. 61 concerns the use of what I believe the wording is intended to enforce, or to
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
require the use of the affirmative resolution procedure in any subsequent changes in the electoral scheme put forward under part I of schedule 1. It fits only into subparagraph (3) of paragraph 1 of the schedule—that is, it is intended for use for subsequent changes. We felt that the first set of electoral arrangements would be sufficiently clearly and closely watched and carefully commented upon by the profession to ensure that nothing was put through quietly or quickly or in a way that would be likely to cause any dissention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, sub-paragraph (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme may be varied from time to time by the Central Council, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State to be signified by order."</p></blockquote>
We felt that for the years to come, when perhaps the interest that the passage of the Bill has aroused amongst all sections of the profession has died away, and when perhaps the whole question is not being as carefully watched as it is at present, there was a need for more emphasis to be placed now on making sure that the subject was fully aired in this House or that subsequent instruments proposing changes should be fully considered by the House. We want to make sure that subsequent changes in the scheme shall be dealt with by the positive route in the House for statutory instruments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Mr. Roland Moyle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the intention and philosophy behind the amendment arc very sound, as one would expect of such an august body as the National Union of Public Employees, and I heartily sympathise with the democratic sentiments which it expressed in the document quoted by the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the union's eagerness to proceed to a democratic regime must have regard to some of the practicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we sounded out the Briggs coordinating committee on the period that should elapse between the setting up of the council and the introduction of full democratic procedures. It was the committee's view, on mature consideration, that two years was the best time to go for. That is based to a large extent on a certain amount of hard, practical experience. For example, if there is to be an effective election, there has first to be a comprehensive and up-to-date register of those entitled to vote. I am led to believe that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
the present register leaves a certain amount to be desired in that respect, particularly when all groups are taken into consideration for the purposes of the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there would first have to be a period during which the electoral register was drawn up and put into proper working order. Then there should be a period for full consultation with all those likely to be affected by the introduction of the electoral scheme, whatever it is. I am sure that all members of the Committee will realise that, only if the electoral scheme receives substantial support from all those likely to be affected by it will it be capable of operating in a way which gives confidence in the Central Council and boards amongst all their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The General Nursing Council has been holding elections every five years for a considerable time. It is that council's considered view that, even with the benefit of its considerable and regular experience in these matters, it takes it about two years to prepare for each election. Although perhaps in the future that timetable could be improved, the experience of the nurses up to now is that that is the period required. That is a useful guide to the way in which the professions might react to the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, therefore, the practicalities of the situation lead me to believe that, in spite of the worthy stable from which the hon. Gentleman's advice comes, two years is still the best period of time to write into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the merit in making the change we are being asked to make in amendment no. 61 as it would mean that every time the matter came before the House of Commons time would have to be set aside to debate the order, even if nobody wanted to debate it. People would have to turn up, parliamentary time would have to be found for it; it would be a cumbersome machine. We are not opposed to debating these matters, but if somebody feels that he wants to pray against such an order, I am sure that he will be able to do so and will be able to have his debate. But if no one wants to pray against it, parliamentary time can be saved. That is a much more flexible system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) expressed his fear that these matters might go by unnoticed. I am sorry that he has such a poor opinion of the parliamentary vigilance of his own
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
party. I think I can safely say on behalf of my hon. Friends that, in the unlikely event of our ever having to go into Opposition, no matter of this sort relating to nurses would ever slip by unnoticed. Therefore, it is only the Conservative Party that appears to be at risk in these matters. My own experience is that hon. Members opposite are equally vigilant, but I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman lacks confidence that they can keep an eye on these matters. In summary, it is an elaborate piece of machinery which I think is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that in principle it is a good idea to debate changes that will amend the effect of legislation, rather than pass them on the nod? Is it not a good idea —irrespective of whether or not there is interest—to have such matters brought up for discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the pressures on parliamentary time, I must confess that, no, I do not share that principle at all. If people want to debate something they should have the opportunity to do so, but there is no point in making provision for debate if the measure is generally acceptable and there is, therefore, no desire for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess myself to be puzzled both by the Minister's reply on amendment no. 60 and by the intention behind amendment no. 61. In dealing with amendment no. 60, the Minister said that it takes more than a year to get a satisfactory register of electors and that the General Nursing Council has found by experience that it takes it two years to get an election on its feet. I think that we could give the Council some lessons on that as we can do it in 22 days flat, but I shall let that pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not see the relevance of the Minister's observations. This sub-paragraph is not about the holding of an election after one or two years. This is about the making of a scheme under which, in due course, elections shall be taken, so that the only relevant part, as I understood it, of the Minister's reply, was that which referred to consultations. His contention—and, I submit, the only relevant one—is that more than 12 months will be needed for the necessary consultations upon a scheme. If that is so, I must say that I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
believe that people are not bestirring themselves in this matter as they ought to do. I cannot really seriously believe that the necessary proposals cannot be put out, comments on them received, discussed and digested, and a scheme put forward, within a year. So I would have thought that the Minister is on weak ground in resisting amendment no. 60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I come to amendment no. 61 I am puzzled by the proposal that whereas the scheme can be brought into force under the negative procedure—for this amendment is not atatched to line 29—amendments to the scheme require the affirmative procedure. Perhaps I have misread the amendment. I may have missed something which applies the affirmative procedure to paragraph 1. But as I read it, under paragraph 1 there is the negative procedure attracted by clause 22, and the proposal is that we should be content with the negative procedure for the major scheme, but however small the amendment that is to be made to it, that has to be by affirmative order. So if there is a case for amendment no. 61, there is an equal and superior case, I would have thought—does the hon. Gentleman want to help me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opening remarks I merely said that we felt that the initial schemes—the big schemes, as the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) calls them, under sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 would attract a great deal of public comment and interest and that, therefore, the urgency for having the procedure which made sure that the subject was properly aired and debated was not as urgent as it was under sub-paragraph 3, where one would he dealing with subsequent amendments which might come up 10, 15 or 20 years from now. We know that the schemes under sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 will have to be considered quite quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still amazed at the proposition that when there is likely to be great public interest in a subject, where the major considerations involved in the Act are at stake, we should be content with the negative procedure, but where details come to be considered, it is essential to have an affirmative procedure so that we do not miss the details. I really think it is derogatory to hon. Members who take an interest in these matters to assume that they need the watchdog of an affirmative procedure to be attached to the minor
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
matters as they might otherwise miss them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may, I shall regard this as a proposition that orders concerned with the scheme—both initial and subsequent—ought to be by affirmative and not by negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Mr. Crawshaw, as you will be tediously aware, the debate as between the affirmative and the negative procedure, if not as old as the hills, is older than most of us in the House of Commons and is a standing part of our pabulum in Standing Committee. But it has changed over the years in its aspect, because in the years when I first remember with innocent open-eyed wonder hearing my elders and betters moving to substitute the affirmative for the negative procedure, both procedures were working, both were actually real and valid, and if there was a negative provision, that meant that not only could a Prayer be tabled but the Prayer would be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not how it is today. The negative procedure today works only by grace of the usual channels, and I am not sure that that is not putting it too high. I think it would probably be more accurate to say that the negative procedure works only by grace of the Government Whips and the Government business managers. So what we are choosing between, nowadays, when we consider affirmative and negative procedure is not between an hour and a half when the Government move that the order be approved and a motion that a humble Address be presented to Her Majesty—we are not making that procedural choice—we are choosing between the necessity of some proceedings on the Floor of the House of Commons and the remote probability of there being any proceedings at all under the negative provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, I must say that while I would listen to argument on sub-paragraph (3), I would believe that we were on strong ground in asking for this procedure under sub-paragraph (1). The Minister said that the question of parliamentary time was involved and that if we put down the affirmative procedure in this paragraph then it would be necessary to debate the orders whether anybody wanted to debate them or not. This is contrary to all experience and contrary to belief out of doors. The House of Commons rarely or never debates anything which it does not want to debate, it is perfectly capable of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
taking anything which is uncontroversial on the nod, and we are assisted in this when matters are uncontroversial—someitems when they are controversial—by the facility with which those who arrange Government business put such matters on the Order Paper at a time when they are likely to arrive late in the day's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like last Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good illustration. I think that the fears of the Government that if they concede this amendment they will find that we are obliged to debate this scheme when nobody wanted to debate it are quite unfounded. We ought to have, I believe, in present circumstances and certainly until we can again make a reality of the negative procedure, the affirmative procedure here, because this scheme is one of the sensitive things in the Bill and it ought to come positively before the House. If nobody objects then nobody will debate it and no time will be lost. But certainly this in sub-paragraph (1) is a case for the affirmative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurie Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to address myself not to the last comments of the righ hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) on the affirmative and negative procedure, the arguments for which are so well known over all Bills and at all times. I know that in this case my right hon. Friend always has the responsibility of trying to protect the general time of the House in addition to his own particular quarter of it. I wish to address myself to the first amendment on the time limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the disadvantages of serving on a Standing Committee of this nature is that we receive many representations. I expect that like me, most hon. Members, thanks to the excellent coverage by the journal 	<i>Nursing Mirror, </i> have this week been inundated with representations from very attractive nurses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not as attractive as I am and therefore has not received so many proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to a representation that I have received from the National Union of Public Employees on the question of the time limit. I have no specific interest to
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
declare, because I am not one of the group of Members of Parliament sponsored by the National Union of Public Employees. As the Committee will know, I am a Co-op man. Nevertheless, I am a member of that union and it has made strong representations to me, following the lines put forward by the amendment, about the need to bring the number of years down from two to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The union asks for this change on two grounds. First, the provision is to draw up an electoral scheme. It is not to do more than that. Therefore, it should not take two years to get that off the ground. It should be possible to do it within one year. The union then puts the very strong case that the early years of this new structure will be formative years when many new provisions will be included and during which there will be a spate of organisational arrangements which will then rest for a decade without a great deal of change. Therefore, it is to the advantage of the ordinary members of all the professions concerned if, at the earliest possible time, we could reach the stage of an elected committee rather than an appointed committee. For those reasons the National Union of Public Employees urges that that should be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will reconsider his attitude to amendment no. 60 and the length of time which the Central Council is to be given to bring in this scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect to those who served on the Briggs committee, I wonder whether they were the best people to ask about the time it would take to bring forward proposals. Those in positions of influence within the professions at the moment, many of them wholly unelected, have inevitably a bias towards a system which has put them at the top. I say this with great respect, but I think that it is a fact of life. I am much more concerned, as I think members of the Committee will be, about the practitioners within the three professions and what I hope will be their impatience to see some proposals which will allow for the democratic government of their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall, within the period of 2 years."</p></blockquote>
We all know that, even if this were to be done within two years, it then has to go to the Secretary of State for him to consider.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
Doubtless he will want to hold consultations himself. I am not necessarily criticising that. Even if he says " I do not formally have to send these proposals out for consultation ", again inevitably there will be those who are dissatisfied with bits of the proposed scheme, and the Minister and the Secretary of State will have at least to consider what they are saying. But the way in which the Bill is worded at present, it is likely to be nearer three years than two before we see agreed proposals which the Secretary of State feels that it is worth bringing to the House for approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my right hon. Friend is taking far too liesurely an approach to this matter. If it is important, enough, which it is, to bring the Bill forward—God knows nobody has hurried over it; there have been six years of consultations to get it to this stage—the Government having taken a decision that it is right to bring this Bill to the House at this time, I found the Minister's response to the amendment—I am sorry to have to say this—wholly unconvincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to say with the amendment is that in one year—12 months —these proposals should be brought forward, since, whatever the initial period allowed, there is likely to be considerable delay between the scheme being proposed and the Secretary of State being able to approve it. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this point and respond more positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has convinced me of the illogicality of the Government's position and I shall accept amendment no. 61. I do not withdraw any of my remarks about the cumbersome nature of the procedures involved as a result, but clearly we cannot have one procedure for one part of the problem and another procedure for the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the preparation for elections, however, I think that the right hon. Gentleman was less than fair to his normal mode of thinking when he said that we organise elections in three weeks. We do not organise elections in three weeks in this House, because the elections are based on a register, and even the revision of a register takes about five or six months to perform by the time one has organised the printing and issuing of the forms, their collection, the canvassing to fill gaps, the promulgation of a draft register for
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
consideration as to whether anybody has been left off and, finally, the issuing of the register. Even the revision of a register takes about six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this matter, we are not considering the revision of a register as such. We are considering the first register ever to be promulgated for elections to the Central Council. I have no immediate evidence to hand, but I suspect that the drafting of the first parliamentary register under the modern system certainly took a great deal longer than six months to set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend not make a distinction between the preparation of a scheme and the actual holding of an election? There is a big difference between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point I was coming to. Obviously the preparation of a scheme will involve the preparation of the first register, because the controlling factor for any election will be, above all—I would have thought that this would not need any persuasion on the part of Members of Parliament—the creation of a new register. It will not only require a new register but the settlement of the principles upon which such a register will be compiled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential matter is that this register will not only be used for electoral purposes but will be used for disciplinary purposes, too. There will be one register, and that will be used for both purposes. I am sorry that I did not elaborate upon this matter in my opening remarks, but 1 thought that that was understood by members of the Committee. Therefore, I must explain it. A certain amount of debate in the Central Council will be required as to what principles shall govern the admission of people to and removal from the register. That will be extremely important, not only from the point of view of elections but from the point of view of discipline, and, therefore, basic rights, in a much wider sense than we have been discussing up till now. On that basis, there will have to be considerable consultation about the principles upon which the election register will be drawn up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There still is a difficulty in that the right hon. Gentleman does not appear to be distinguishing between defining the principles on which the electoral register is to be compiled—that is, deciding who is to be on it—and then proceeding to draw up that register. Certainly in our experience these are two distinct matters. We define who is to be an elector by Act of Parliament, and then the procedure of compiling the register on those principles follows. But in this' scheme, as I understand it, we are only concerned with defining who the electors are to be. That does not involve all the business of identifying them, putting them on the register, hearing challenges and so on. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will distinguish between these two matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was. I thought also that we agreed that the mechanical process of actually putting people on the register was probably the least of our worries relative to the decision of the principles which should govern the compilation of the register, and it is that, in addition to the compilation of the register, which is going to soak up a great deal of the two years in the judgment, if I may say so, of a number of people who have had responsibility for these matters for many years.

I think that it is a little irresponsible of the Committee to contemplate telling such people how they should go about their business. We are all seized of the fact that is very important indeed that the processes of democracy should be speeded up rather than slowed down. I would not have agreed to a period of two years if I thought that the members of the nursing professions could manage their business within one year. I hope that the Committee is now seized of the important matters which are involved in compiling the register concerned and of the fact that it may be very dangerous indeed to force on the profes-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend is quite right to draw the attention of the Committee to the elaboration that will take place on the election itself. But I think that that argues strongly for the case that the preparation of the scheme should be carried out more quickly. One accepts the fact that it will be a complicated procedure to get the election finally mounted, but that is all the more reason why one should make the decisions about the framework within which the work will be done by an earlier date than two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I find the Minister's argument totally unconvincing. I am coming more and more to the uneasy feeling that this Bill was brought prematurely before the House and the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said an interesting thing in his remarks just now. He said that he did not want to force the pace on the Central Council. But we have just had examples of the whole thing being carried at a forced pace. We have had all these objections from people who believe that the Minister is forcing the pace. Yet he now protests, in response to the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan), that he does not want to force the pace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that comment. In the earlier part of his address to us, the Minister said that the present register had unsatisfactory aspects. That is very unsatisfactory for the Committee to hear. The Government have also had a great deal of time when they knew that this Bill was likely to come before the House in which to work out what they were going to do. I would have thought that there was ample time.

Once again we want to force the pace on the Government when the Bill becomes law. We want to see the sense of urgency kept up so that the Minister moves on in achieving an elected board instead of the appointed board, because we believe that until an elected board is set up the real purpose of the Bill, of furthering and improving the standards and education of the professions, will not really get under way.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) carrying out preliminary investigations of cases of alleged misconduct, with a view to proceedings before the Central Council or a committee of the Council for a person to be removed from the register ".</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading, the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) drew attention to the ambiguity of the present wording of the clause. The intention of substituting for subsection (1)(	<i>e</i>) the words in the amendment is to remove that ambiguity. With the present words it is possible to construe that in investigating causes of alleged misconduct the national boards themselves will be able to determine what constitutes misconduct, rather than the Central Council. I confidently hope that if the matter ever becomes an issue before the courts, the present wording will make it quite clear that the matter of misconduct is one for the Central Council to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought to acknowledge in turn the very handsome manner in which the right hon. Gentleman has met the point which I raised on Second Reading.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
I believe, and I think that the Minister agrees, that there should be no ambiguity as to the division in this respect between the functions of the national boards and of the Central Council. I believe that this wording will substantially clarify that. The clarification will, I know, give satisfaction to members of the professions, out of discussions with whom in my own Province the importance of this point emerged. I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the consideration which he has given to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister give us a little more clarification on the procedure he envisages under which the boards will carry out their investigations? Is this to be an inquiry set by, say, the chairman and two other members in a small committee or is it to be a preliminary hearing? We want to hear whether it is intended that there should be an earlier trial. We do not want to see two trials in this case. This is merely an investigation of prima facie evidence that there is to be a reference to the Central Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The disciplinary function will be a function for the Central Council, as it will be the guardian of the register. It is therefore a decision for the Central Council whether someone should be placed on the register or removed from it because of the qualification he has or for reasons of professional misconduct, as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the national board is to conduct a preliminary investigation in the part of the United Kingdom for which it is responsible. It may decide to have a hearing before all the members of the national board, but I think that would be unlikely. I think that it would appoint a subcommittee to consider the matter, whose function it would be to collect the facts relating to the case and to decide whether there was any case for the Central Council to investigate. If it came to the conclusion that there was no case for the Central Council, the matter would rest there. If it decided that there might be a case for the Central Council to consider and decide upon, the facts of the case would be referred to the Central Council, which is certainly likely to appoint a committee to consider such matters when they come to it.

of the general public, for whom this unified profession is being set up, should be properly involved.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend, but I was surprised that the Minister had not realised where the amendment was intended to fit into the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I do not see why the hon. Gentleman should be anything other than surprised at my not knowing where the amendment should go. There are two committees. There is a proposed insertion after some committee or other and there is no indication as to which committee is meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there was an error in the amendment when it was first printed. It is now correct where it says " after first Committee'." The Minister is right. On the previous amendment paper it did not indicate which of the two committees was being referred to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the purposes of clarity, perhaps I may say that the insertion of the words on the amendment paper is supposed to come after the words "Midwifery Committee". In other words, we intend to have, if the amendment is carried, two members of the general public included on the midwifery committee, one of whom must be a woman. We have not sought to-:;make that proviso with regard to the finance committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us why? Is he implying that women are
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
not to be trusted with money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not dream of saying that. What we are saying here is that there are certain aspects of the Bill—with which the hon. Gentlemna is familiar in the light of the amendments we discussed at the last sitting—where the consumer interests, by which I mean those of patients, have a particularly valuable role to play. Therefore, we have sought at various stages throughout the passage of the Bill—amendments have been discussed and there are still amendments which may be discussed—to include in the various committees members of the public as giving a new slant and a new input of experience and ideas to this new unified profession. In certain instances, particularly dealing with the midwifery committee—because of its particular interest for women—we have sought to make sure that one woman is obligatorily put on to the committees and that, we feel, is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why the finance committee should not have similar obligations is quite simple. Obviously it involves a more specialised and more technical matter which does not directly concern members of the general public. None the less, as the Minister would no doubt say, the Secretary of State will have rights of appointment and he will no doubt bear in mind the various interests and the various experiences required in making those appointments. Therefore, we are not saying that women should not be appointed to the finance committee, but we are saying definitely that the Secretary of State's hands should be tied to ensure that there should be at least one woman from the general public on the midwifery committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said previously, we have been round this course several times. We have an amendment (	<i>a</i>) tabled to new clause I which is still on the amendment paper. We debated the whole question of the public interest at the last sitting when we made certain amendments to clause 4(5). The arguments that we put forward then still stand. We believe that the general public have a valuable role to play. We believe that at least one female member of the general public has a particularly valuable role to play in the constitution of the midwifery committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly anxious to accept the amendment for the reason I argued against a similar amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
ment on a previous clause. I am quite happy that there should be representation on the committee of members of the consuming public—again to use that phrase—but I am not anxious that they should be included as appointed members of a committee. We are anxious to keep the machinery as simple as possible. We will be under compulsion, as a result of amendments being introduced into the Bill, to make sure that the midwifery committees have a majority of practising midwives. We were thinking of a committee about a dozen strong. One might therefore have seven midwives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, it is important to have a representative of each of the four medical specialties connected with midwifery—pediatricians, gynaecologists, obstetricians and general practitioners. Each committee would want to keep an eye on education and training, so it would be necessary to have educationists as well. So there would be five appointed members, and probably more than one educationalist would be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, each committee would have also two members of the general public. I have already drawn attention to the fact that, by virtue of the sex composition of the midwifery profession and the natural order of things, the committees are almost bound to contain women with personal experience of</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>If the amendment were accepted, there would be a minimum of eight appointed members. We should then have to increase the number of elected midwives to ensure that they were in a majority. We are now rapidly increasing the size of the committees. I am not saying that would be a fatal flaw in the committees, but we are anxious to have an administrative machine which needs the minimum commitment in terms of midwives' time. There is the machinery of co-option to make sure that the particular interest with which we are concerned is represented on the committees. That will not upset the balance of elected, practising midwives and appointed members. For those reasons, I do not think that we should accept the amendment.</p>

	<p>I shall be extremely brief, because, in my view, the amendment has already been superseded by new clause no. 1. Therefore, I do not propose either to delay the Committee long or to press the amendment strongly.</p>
	<p>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing a point of view about this amendment and later amendments relating to other groups within the Bill—midwives, health visitors and districts nurse. We all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
have a responsibility to recognise the genuine fears of the smaller groups in relation to the large body of general nursing staff. My right hon. Friend referred to that point on new clause no. 1. I am now concerned that, in trying to cater for the genuine fears of these groups in some form of legislative protection, we do not destroy the ultimate purpose of the Bill, which is to have an integrated, unified structure.</p>
	<p>We have to remember that minorities in a democracy have rights, but very often, in so doing, we forget that the majority, too, has rights. This amendment and others are the result of effective pressures which we have received, understood and have genuinely tried to meet. Nevertheless, if meeting those fears resulted in a fragmented structure, the whole purpose of the Briggs report would be nullified and lost.</p>
	<p>I hope that we can allay the genuine fears which have been expressed by the right form of words and leave the midwives —and perhaps later in the Bill the health visitors and district nurses—with their own initiatives based on experience which goes back many years. At the same time, they should not be hived off so that they have powers which supersede or are greater than those of the central organisation. One of the great tragedies of National Health Service reorganisation was that a similar minority group was able to exert such pressure that the family practitioner committee emerged unscathed from that reorganisation, and general practitioners, who have never been and have no intention of being integrated, remain unintegrated. That was one of the many tragedies of the disastrous measure put forward by the Conservative Government.</p>
	<p>I do not want to press the amendment, because my right hon. Friend has perhaps already given too much to allay these fears. I believe that we shall have greater responsibility on Report and further stages of the Bill not merely to allay the fears of the minority groups, but to satisfy ourselves that, in so doing, we have not completely alienated the vast majority of those who are organised at the moment in the General Nursing Council, the Royal College of Nursing, COHSE, NUPE and the main stream of the nursing profession.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) has put forward an interesting argument. He said that the amendment had already been overtaken
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
by new clause no. 1. That, however, is a step backwards, because the amendment goes much further than new clause no. 1. We support his view that midwives should be fully safeguarded, but we do not want to tie them down in their committee to such an extent that it is difficult to work it. On the other hand, we do not want to undermine the functions of the Central Council.

The hon. Gentleman put his finger on the main problem that we are about to face in the Bill. We want the Central Council to unite the various professions. We want it to function without too much interference. At the same time we want to safeguard the minority groups. But, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, in safeguarding the interests of the minority, we must not restrict and intrude too far on the majority. That is the problem that we face, and I believe that we shall face it even more when we come to the next clause.

I hope that the Minister will put his mind to this matter. The Bill, as it stands, is not satisfactory. Yet the amendments which are being put forward are not satisfactory either. Something in between the two must come out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) indicated earlier that he considered that new clause no. 1 overtook the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt). But nothing in the new clause refers to—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the education and training and further education and training of midwives "</p></blockquote>
which is clearly laid down in my hon. Friend's amendment. Therefore, I cannot follow the hon. Gentleman's reasoning, for saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem that faces the Committee. The hon. Gentleman is quite right that there is nothing in new clause no. 1 which deals with education. But we understood from the Minister that the committee will deal with all matters affecting midwifery. "All matters" presumably involves education aspects as they come along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite what the Minister has made clear, the virtue of the amendment is that it spells out clearly what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
should be some of the functions of the council. Therefore, as the Bill is mainly about education and training, it is valuable to do that. I hope, therefore, that my right hon. Friend will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to what my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) said. He put his finger on the point. There are words which tie down this subsection in a very close degree. It is precisely because of that fact that I am not anxious to press the amendment at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were discussing the overall group of amendments which included new clause no. 1, a number of points were made. Sometimes I think that we are inclined to forget that the Bill is entirely about education and training, not structural reorganisation. The Salmon report dealt with that aspect in 1967. We are about to put the education and training structure on the back of that report as a significant contribution to sorting out some of the anomalies of the Salmon restructuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) was quite right in as much as both new clause No. 1 and the amendment have defects within them. I listened with care to the precise point that he made about including the words in the subsection. But I should still prefer that there be further consultation among all the parties concerned. I realise that we have a responsibility for legislating for them. That is the end of the line. But we should do so only when we have achieved the maximum amount of agreement between the people for whom we are legislating. On those grounds, I should prefer a little more time before we put a precise ruling on this matter on the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, I thought that the hon. Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) was intervening in my speech. Perhaps I may now conclude the point that I was making. I hope that the Minister will understand the Committee's dilemma and will address his mind to this point. As it stands, the Bill is not satisfactory in safeguarding minority interests, but at the same time we do not have satisfactory amendments before us. I hope that between now and when we come to the later clauses the Minister will come up with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
suggestion as to how we can meet this serious dilemma. I believe that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are now getting an enormous and increasing post bearing representations from bodies right across the country which are very anxious about the Bill as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fairly wide debate on amendment no. 12, which I gather my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) does not intend to press. However, it has allowed us to take stock almost of the position we have now reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not entirely go along with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan) in his last contribution. He said that the Bill, as it stands, does not protect minority interests. I think that it does. However, I take on board the unease still felt by many members of the Committee that perhaps that message is not conveyed to the minority groups within the professions with the necessary strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South summed up the broad principles of the situation fairly clearly. I agree that we must make sure that the Central Council remains in overall control and that from that point of view none of the amendments so far moved was satisfactory. We all sense the existence of this feeling of unease, and we shall discuss this in more detail when we come to the next clause. My hon. Friend said that a particular responsibility would be laid upon all of us on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, if between now and Report the professions and groups represented on the Briggs co-ordinating committee come to me with suggestions which will further reassure the minority groups, I shall pay great heed to those suggestions. I give my hon. Friend that very firm assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an illustration of the unsatisfactory nature of moving amendments quickly, I believe that I could not take a better example than the present one. In this connection, perhaps I may comment upon the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne). If the amendment were to be accepted by the Committee, it would have a very restrictive effect on the midwifery committees. Clause 6(2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each Board shall consult its Midwifery Committee on all matters relating to midwifery."</p></blockquote>
That means that every subject which comes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
up can be referred to the midwifery committee for its opinion. If the amendment were to be accepted, that wide remit of the midwifery committee would be restricted to matters listed in the amendment—education and training, further education and training and so forth. Therefore, the boards would not have to consult their midwifery committees on a wide range of matters. Disciplinary matters are an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that the Committee finds itself in a dilemma. I reiterate that if between now and Report the groups involved in the Briggs co-ordinating committee come to me with some solutions for the sense of unease that is obviously felt by the Committee, I shall certainly pay the highest regard to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other point that I wish to mention. On almost all matters in the Bill there is a majority and a minority. The fact that members of the Committee are receiving representations from a number of people about certain aspects of the Bill does not mean that there is a not broad consensus for the general principles of the Bill. I would like to utter that word of warning to hon. Gentlemen and my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the discussion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"including the supervision of midwifery practice."</p></blockquote>
We have been over this ground a number of times. The intention behind the amendment is to safeguard the position of the midwives. It is on that basis that we submit it to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely worried that if I accept this amendment it may lead to considerable confusion. The supervision of midwifery practice has always been a matter for the various health authorities. If the hon. Gentleman will turn to clause 15 he will see it stated that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following bodies shall be local supervising authorities for midwives:—
	<ol>
	<li>in England, Regional Health Authorities;</li>
	<li>in Wales, Area Health Authorities;</li>
	<li>in Scotland, Health Boards; and</li>
	<li>in Northern Ireland, Health and Social Services Boards."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
I feel very strongly that if we introduce this amendment into clause 6, we shall create confusion about who is supposed to supervise midwifery practice. It goes without saying that midwifery committees will have a great supervision over practising midwives, for professional reasons; but there is no clear distinction in this amendment between professional and service reasons, and the supervision of midwifery practice in service is, of course, covered by clause 15.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 72, in page 5, line 9, after " Board", insert

I thank the Minister for accepting the fact that we put down this amendment to insert the words after the wrong "Board", i.e. the word on line 8 as opposed to that on line 9. We are grateful to the Minister for being prepared to open discussion on this amendment today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments here parallel some of our discussion on clause 3(4), where we were dealing with standing committees of the Central Council. Our concern here is that when national boards set up other standing committees for various specialties, which are not laid out in the same detail as those in clause 3(4), a majority of the membership should be drawn from the specialty concerned. This simply parallels the discussions we had about other parts of the Bill and the requests we made. If these national board standing committees are to have an effective presence and are to be able to make a worthwhile contribution to the operation and work of the national boards, they must have access to people with proper experience of the specialty with which they are engaged. The amendment, if accepted, would merely ensure that each of the national board standing committees, when set up, would have a majority of members from that specialty. It seems an eminently common-sensical and reasonable amendment and one that I hope the Minister will be able to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to save the time of the Committee by saying that I can accept the principle of the amendment. I am

	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
afraid that I cannot accept the wording, and therefore I shall have to move an amendment on Report to take care of it. I cannot accept the wording because some of the committees will deal with such matters as training or clinical nursing studies which cannot be regarded as specialties. The use of the term "specialty" may therefore be confusing rather than helpful. I will produce an amendment on Report to meet this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed, </i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we can let this clause go through without returning to what we have discussed on several occasions. We discussed it in connection with the new clause and we discussed it—rather briefly, I thought—on amendment no. 12. I refer to the immensely important division of views about who will be responsible for formulating education policy under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seem to be two extreme views on the argument. One extreme is reflected by the Bill. The point at issue is how the specialist committees which are to be set up—such as the midwifery committees and perhaps, later on in the Bill, the health visitors' committee—shall play their part in formulating the education policy of the Central Council. As the Bill stands, and as Clause 6 will stand, the position is vague, as, I think, the Committee will agree. The arguments of the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) and the hon. Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) seem to show that they share this point of view. At the present time, the Minister, the multi-disciplinary council and the multidisciplinary boards are jointly responsible for formulating the education policy of the specialist professions. On the other hand, we have had many representations from the specialist minority professions. They wish to see their committees becoming a recognised authority for formulating the education policy of the boards in their spheres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the two extremes of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
argument. The gap between them has not yet been bridged. We hope that as the Bill progresses we shall see a meeting on this issue. Unless we get a more acceptable answer to the gulf between these two arguments, there could be a lot of protest from both sides, both from the major constituent of the new Central Council—the nurses—and from the minority professions—the midwives and the health visitors. Sooner or later, we must hear how the Minister is going to resolve this gulf. The hon. Member for Brent, South was absolutely right not to press amendment no. 12, because there is time for a great deal more consultation between the Minister and the representatives of both the nurses and the minority professions on this issue. But before we leave the Bill we must bridge this gulf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Central Council is to bring together the various professions in order to bring about a uniformity of standards and training under one umbrella authority which is solely responsible for registration and, therefore, for recognition of nurses, midwives and health visitors and the other professions with which we are dealing. That desire for uniformity amongst these professions must not be watered down. At the same time, we have to protect the individual minority professions more than I think is being done in the Bill as it stands, although I agree entirely that the new clause goes a long way towards that. But is does not go as far towards it as far as education is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment no. 12 referred primarily to education. It is in the education sector that we need the gulf to be bridged. Therefore, I hope that before we reach the end of the Committee stage we shall hear a great deal more from the Government as to how they intend to bridge the gap that I have elicited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This takes us into new territory, because we are starting to look at the whole question of health visiting and district nursing and the role of the community health services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true—and the Minister will no doubt note it—that the amendment as tabled leaves something of a difficulty with regard to clause 3(4)(	<i>c</i>), where one of the standing committees of the Central Council which could be sent up is especifically the district nursing standing committee. That is undeniably so, but it is fair to say that we have had some urgent representations from district nurses who were taken aback by the speed with which the Bill was published, the small gap between publication and Second Reading and the quick move into Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really am breathless when the hon. Gentleman says " speed ". The scheme upon which the Bill was founded was propounded on 27th February last. The Bill was not published until the beginning of November. That is a matter of some eight months. I would scarcely regard that as speedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should clarify my words. It is the gap between the publication of the Bill and the Second Reading Debate which caused surprise. It was a point made by several hon. Members during Second Reading. The Bill then went into Committee, and that has left some of the smaller groups perhaps slightly taken aback.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure when the last detailed requirement for nurses to be familiar with parliamentary procedure was, but I dare say that they are not entirely familiar—as familiar as the Minister and Members of
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
this House arc—with the way parliamentary procedure works. 1 am not discussing the gap between February and October. I am discussing the gap between publication of the Bill, Second Reading and the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving this amendment, we are fully cognisant of the inequality of the idiosyncracy that would be caused to clause 3(4)(	<i>c</i>). We would be willing to see at some later stage suitable changes made to ensure that the proper balance is maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, the comment has been made to us that part I of schedule I makes no mention of district nurses either, and that is the part which covers the constitution of the Central Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the specifics of the amendment. We seek to set up a district nursing joint committee which would parallel the health-visiting joint committee as presently proposed by clause 7. There is a number of reasons why we think this important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Briggs report referred in some detail to the importance of district nursing as a profession. I shall quote briefly from para. 534 of the Briggs report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In some areas, however, confusion has arisen because the responsibilities of field workers in the community are more nearly akin to those of ward sisters in the hospital context … first line management in the community services is comparable to lower middle management in hospital. The basic field workers in the community (the health visitor, the district midwife and the district nurse) are not only required to make decisions on their own initiative, but at the same time have managerial responsibilities for staff working with them in a supporting role."</p></blockquote>
Briggs made it clear that he and his committee felt that the basic field workers in the community have a valuable role to play. He mentioned specifically three categories of basic field workers in the community: the health visitors, with whom we are dealing in clause 7; the district midwives, who have a particular set-up which we have been discussing this morning; and the district nurse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is fair to say that the way Briggs considered the district nurses and referred to them in his report indicates that he foresaw the district nurse being treated in roughly the same sort of way as the midwife and the health visitor and having a particular role and place in the structure of the new nursing profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to explain to the Committee why midwives are treated on one basis, with a very specialised committee, and the health visitors are treated on another basis, with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
a joint committee of central and national boards, while the district nurses are treated on yet another basis with just a putative—not an obligatory—standing committee at the Central Council. That seems to me, with the three branches which we are dealing with and which are carrying out a valuable role in community care, to be entirely inequitable and illogical treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the district nurse seems to be undeniably valuable as a preventive service. The two particular groups who benefit from the district nurses' attention are the very young and the elderly. It is interesting to note that the Government's own recent publication "A Happier Old Age " makes clear reference to the importance of this branch of the nursing profession. Para. 1.1 of that report reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are now 6.6 million people in England and 0.5 million in Wales aged 65 years and over, representing 14% of the total population. Between 1966 and 1976, the number of people aged 65 and over increased by 20% … By 1986, there will be approximately 24% more people aged 75 and over than there are now."</p></blockquote>
I know from my own researches that the number of people aged 85 and over—that is, the very elderly—will increase by nearly 50 per cent. over the next 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in "A Happier Old Age", the Government go on to say, in para 6.3, on page 32:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Elderly people account for about 20% of all general practitioner consultations; two-thirds of these take place at home where the person is over 75."</p></blockquote>
Para 6.6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present, just under 50% of cases dealt with by district nurses and about 15% of those of health visitors involve elderly people. Both the health visiting and district nursing services have responsibilities to other priority groups such as young children and it can be argued that health visitors should spend proportionately less time with elderly people and district nurses proportionately more."</p></blockquote>
It goes on at the end of the paragraph to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is the scope for adjusting the roles of community nurses and for expanding the help provided by auxiliary staff within the district nursing service?"</p></blockquote>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have there produced a well-argued discussion document which brings forward a lot of points about elderly people. In it they say that there are now nearly one-quarter more elderly people than there were in 1966, that 50 per cent. of district nurses' time is taken up with
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
elderly people, and that district nurses should spend proportionately more time with elderly people—this fast-increasing category of our population. They are even making the suggestion that the role of district nurses should be expanded. In the light of that sort of comment, it seems to me extraordinary that the Government should not have seen fit to provide district nurses with the same sort of set-up and structure as they are proposing to provide for health visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar arguments, though not in terms of numbers, apply to the young. There is no doubt that many mothers find the role of the district nurse as helper and adviser valuable in the extreme in bringing up young children. It is particularly true in the more deprived areas of our society, where, if people are to break out of the cycle of deprivation, as it has become known in jargon, the role of the district nurse in post-natal care is very valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the district nurse is undeniable. The question, therefore, is why the Government have not seen fit to give the district nurses the same set-up as health visitors. One of the reasons, as was mentioned on Second Reading, is that community care is messy by comparison with hospital care. It is not easy to organise community care as effectively and as neatly as hospital care. Therefore, the concern of the nursing profession, the majority of whom work in hospitals is, that district nurses should be brought within the same type of structure, which is neater and more easily controlled. Conversely, this only increases the fear and concern of district nurses that, because they are nurses at one remove from hospital nursing, they will eventually be swallowed up into hospital nursing by the far larger number of nurses involved in intra-hospital care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, the amendment is important because of the flexibility that district nurses bring to the differing health care needs of differing areas. A standing committee of the Central Council will not enable the district nursing profession to develop as flexibly as it has in the past and to respond as imaginatively and as flexibly to the different nursing needs of different areas. It is hard for us to underestimate the different roles that a district nurse plays in an entirely rural area, a suburban area or an inner-city area. She will need immense flexibility of approach and highly imaginative training to enable her to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
respond effectively to the health care needs of the different types of community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, one body of the Central Council, trying to cover the varied healthcare needs of the entire country, does not seem to me to be realistic. While there is nothing to prevent a national board setting up a district nursing standing committee under clause 6, none the less, even the Central Council is not obliged to set up a district nursing committee. Therefore, what are the chances of a national board doing likewise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is slightly confusing me. At the moment he is arguing, I think, for a joint committee for district nurses. At the same time, he seems to me to be regretting the fact that the national boards will not be compelled to setup their own committees. The whole idea of a standing joint committee for district nurses is that there shall be no standing committees of national boards. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make my point a little clearer. Under clause 3(4)(	<i>c</i>) we have the possibility of a district nursing standing committee at the Central Council. That is a possibility, not an obligation; it could be set up and it is referred to by name. Under clause 6(4) standing committees of a national board may be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I opened my remarks by saying that if we are going for a joint committee of the council and the boards for district nursing, just as we have already proposed for health visiting under clause 7, there are some idiosyncracies under clause 3(4). We accept that, and I tried to explain why the district nurses had been taken aback by the speed with which progress has been made from the time of the publication of the Bill. Therefore, I do not in any way regret clause 6(4). I merely say that if the Bill in its present form goes through unamended there is no obligation upon anybody anywhere to set up any form of specialist district nursing committee of any sort. There is the possibility at the Central Council under clause 3(4), there is the possibility at the national boards under clause 6(4), but there is no obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister has recognised the importance of the district nurses by the improvements that he has been making in the structure of the district nursing profession—the introduction of mandatory district nursing training, the suggestion of
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
the strengthening of a panel of assessors, and a number of other changes which he has put forward. I believe that in part he has misled the district nurses—I am prepared to accept that it was unwitting—who have come to believe that they were promised a set-up similar to that for health visitors. From reading the correspondence which has been passed to me, I believe that the Minister did not, in fact, make that promise, but I think that the promise was understood to have been made although it was not and that that has led to increased unhappiness with the eventual outcome of their position on the part of the district nurses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the district nurses have been referred to in the Briggs report as performing a valuable service. From the Government's own publications it is clear that they are going to have an increasingly important role to play, for preventive reasons, for reasons of community care, and because the number of elderly persons is increasing very dramatically. They perform a role very similar to that of the health visitors with whom they could usefully link at national and local levels. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to hear, Mr. Crawshaw, that I do not propose to read all the items which I hold in my left hand. But I indicate them to you because they form the mail received during the past few weeks in regard to the point involved in this particular debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From Edinburgh to County Armagh, from Bristol to London, there are those of the nursing profession who argue that the Bill is a compromise Bill in that, given the situation in the Briggs report, they would have very little reference to specialist groups at all within this legislation. To them, a unified service means one based and discussed solely on the basis of nurses. I quote a passage which occurs in almost all the letters I have received. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In an attempt to enhance their own interest a small though undoubtedly important minority of Nurses with a specialist interest are undermining the interests of the vast majority of Nurses."</p></blockquote>
I shall not continue quoting, but that is the gist of the argument that is being put into these letters. I shall be brief but honest—that claims seems to me to be completely contrary to the position. Within the council and the national boards the nurses have an in-built majority. So how on earth can the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
recognition of the interests of health visitors and others affect the overall ethos contained in the Bill? It seems totally absurd to present that argument. Yet that is the one that we are being asked to take on board. Some writers mentioned that they were not actuated by specialist interests and therefore they ought to be accepted. The argument tends to be turned on its head, because they are really saying "We are the only interest that ought to be considered. You can safely ignore health visitors, midwives and others." Some of the letters make a slight change in respect of midwives. But since I reject the notion that they are in any way threatened by the acceptance of the rights of minorities—the health visitors are a minority in the Bill—I have considerable sympathy for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have now arrived at the most controversial and, I suggest, most unsatisfactory part of the Bill, for which in our view the Minister bears a heavy responsibility. He has completely failed to satisfy or to explain to the specialist groups how their future and identity will be safeguarded by the Bill as it stands. In any event, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are now getting substantial representations that some groups are extremely anxious about their future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When discussing new clause no. 1 we said that its acceptance depended very much on what the Minister had in mind, when we came to clause 7, for safeguarding groups other than midwives. That is still the point. He has not told us what he has in mind, if anything, other than what is in the Bill at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing some highly specialised nurses with their own traditions, their own loyalties, their pride in their past and their own ways of having been trained. I understand, for example, that 16 per cent, of midwives do not go through general nursing training; they come straight into midwifery. They are a very mixed group of highly trained nursing professions. They want to work together, they see the advantages of the Central Council, but at the same time they want to preserve their own position. I think that is an understandable point of view which the Committee should accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong, in our view, for the Government to ride roughshod over their
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
views and force them into a form of collaboration which they do not see as right and preserving their identity. In fact, in many of our debates so far we have discussed the need for the Central Council to start on a good footing with lots of goodwill and collaboration. I suggest to the Minister that this is not the way to achieve that end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We keep discussing this dilemma of preserving the functions of the Central Council and giving proper freedom of action to other groups to supervise their own functions. It is not merely the mid-wives and the health visitors, but the district nurses. That is why we have tabled the amendment asking for a joint committee for district nurses, and the psychiatric nurses are concerned as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our advice is that the Minister should respect these anxieties. Either he should seek the leave of the Committee to postpone the discussion of this clause until later, so that he has an opportunity for further discussions with the various groups, or the Committee as a whole—we would perhaps seek your advice on this point later on, Mr. Crawshaw—should adjourn its deliberations until the Minister has had time to have further consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister is likely to tell us that consultations have gone on for a long time and have not reached unanimous agreement and that, therefore, any further consultations now would not be likely to reach a unanimous agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not accept that. There is nothing more likely to concentrate the mind than having in front of one a Bill with specific proposals. It makes one realise that perhaps there have to be changes, and there must be agreement of some kind between the professions. We think that the various bodies should be called together again and given an opportunity to come forward with proposals which will meet all their requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our view, first, that this Bill was premature in being brought before Parliament. Quite clearly, many parts of it had not been thought out, but here we have it. It is absolutely essential that we do not force through a Bill against the wishes of many sections of the nursing community. Our advice to the Minister would be to take this clause away, have further discussions, and then come back to the Committee with something much more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
likely to command unanimous support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have representations from the specialist groups. We also understand that the Royal College of Nursing sympathises with and understands the anxiety of these specialist groups, who think that clause 7 is unsatisfactory as it stands. So, on both sides, we have groups of people who would wish to see this clause changed. It is on that basis that we advise the Minister—we are only trying to help; this is not a party political matter, because we all want a satisfactory Bill to pass through this Committee—that the Bill is unsatisfactory and that he should have further talks with the specialist groups, the colleges and the General Nursing Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer both to the matter of timing, which has been raised in the debate, and to the content of the clause and the amendments. It has been asserted that for those who are affected by it, the timetable of the Bill has been unfairly constricted. But the timetable is in every respect the normal timetable for legislation which goes through the House. From that observation, there follow some important conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I particularly am referring to this matter is that this is one of the earliest pieces of United Kingdom legislation to have the same effect in Northern Ireland in matters of this kind as in the rest of the Kingdom. Hitherto, that legislation has either, during the interim period, been by Order in Council or, for 50 years, by the local Parliament. Therefore, whatever impact the process of legislation makes upon the professions in Great Britain, the experience for the professions in Northern Ireland will be much more novel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Order in Council procedure, as the right hon. Gentleman knows only too well—we have spent many nights together on it—there was a specific period of consultation on proposals for a draft order. As to legislation in the old Northern Ireland Parliament, there is no dispute, whatever else one might say, about the greater availability and accessibility to the Northern Ireland public of proceedings there compared with proceedings in the capital of the United Kingdom. But the fact remains that this measure is welcomed in Northern Ireland, not least because it is United Kingdom legislation. The Bill will embrace in its scope the professions practising in Northern Ireland, along with
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
the rest, and embody them in the same statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a corollary to that. When we gain something, we generally find that there is a price attached to it. As Northern Ireland is more and more legislated for in the proper parliamentary manner in the House, response to the proposals will have to be more prompt and better prepared than has been necessary in living memory in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the brief period between the presentation of a Bill and its Second Reading and between its Second Reading and Committee stage is not adequate for professions fully to make up their minds upon the matters at issue. But then nobody suggested that it was. It is the implication of our parliamentary legislative procedure that where large changes are proposed a very long and an intimate process of consultation shall have preceded it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the question to which the Committee should be addressing its mind is not whether this Bill is being rushed but whether the matter has been before the professions and the public long enough for them to know, when the Bill comes, whether it is or is not what they wanted. I believe that the Government have made out an overwhelming case to show that that availability for study, reflection and decision has been more than ample. In my view, therefore, the suggestion that we ought not to consider ourselves ready to come to decisions on the Bill is ill-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From that I pass to the content of the clause and the amendment. The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) referred to clause 3 and to the mention of district nursing in clause 3(4)(	<i>c</i>). Now, subsection (4) seems to me to contain the refutation of this amendment. For I would say that if district nursing is right in clause 3(4)—and nobody moved to leave it out when we dealt with it—district nursing ought not to appear in clause 7 in the form which this amendment proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will add to that a parallel argument by referring to schedule 1, where in paragraph 1(2) of part I we find set out the professions represented on the boards: practising nurses, practising midwives, practising health visitors and those engaged in teaching those forms of professional work. Again I say, if district nurses do not appear in part I of schedule 1 to the Bill, they ought not to appear in clause 7 in the form which is proposed. In other words, the structure of clause 7 is wholly consistent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
with the conception of the Bill as a whole which the Committee has approved by its acceptance of clause 3 and schedule 1. That whole structure would be seriously disturbed if we were to make this amendment or any other on the same lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman would accept that clause 4 refers specifically to national boards and the Central Council. In clause 4 and the earlier clauses there is no suggestion of joint committees. Joint committees of council and boards are referred to in clause 7 for the first time. Therefore it is surely logical that we should be addressing ourselves to that clause in this regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not refer to clause 4 at all. But the hon. Gentleman carries me further in my argument. What I referred to was clause 3—the functions of a Central Council and the respective sub-divisions, as it were, on which the Committee is agreed, of some of the most important work of the Central Council—and, in the schedule, the professional composition of the boards. In clause 7 we are now dealing with a joint committee to service both the council and the boards. Therefore, I think that my argument stands unaffected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thorne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the right hon. Gentleman agree that district nursing, to which he made reference earlier, is referred to in clause 3, though not in schedule 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly so. But is is referred to in clause 3 not as a profession among the professions to be represented but as a specialised aspect of the general concern of the council as a whole for the functions of education and training as a whole. That is why the reference to district nursing in the structure of the Bill in clause 3 is in my view inconsistent with the creation of a joint committee in clause 7 specifically related to health visiting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the right hon. Gentlemen's great experience of these matters, how does he feel that the Committee should deal with this matter when, in the course of the Committee, we discover a substantial problem facing district nurses? I understand his argument entirely when we discuss clause 3 but, unfortunately, the situation seems to have changed a little since then as regards the informa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
tion given to us as members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand that the situation has changed in that the argument has been put forward for what is proposed in respect of health visiting to be dittoed in respect of district nursing. But that does not make such a decision any more consistent with the concept and structure of the Bill and, in my view, with the concept and structure of the council and the national boards. That is the essence of my argument. My own feeling is that we are entitled to come at this stage in the Committee's work to a decision on this matter, and that consistently with the whole intention of the Bill we ought not to make these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a lengthy debate on this group of amendments. Perhaps I should emphasise that we are talking about district nursing. That is the important matter to bear in mind. Secondly, I should make clear that we have undertaken that we intend to set up a district nursing standing committee of the Central Council. Therefore, in due course legislation will be laid before the House in the form of a statutory instrument to achieve that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have not made clear up till now is that it will be a joint committee, but I give an undertaking that the form the committee will take will be that of a joint committee. The reason for that is that, like health visitors, district nurses have a uniform training structure for the whole of the United Kingdom and, therefore, they ought to have uniform supervisory machinery for that training. That is the basis upon which we are moving forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of those two firm undertakings, which is understood by all members of the Briggs Co-ordinating committee, I feel that these amendments, from the point of view of safeguarding district nurses, are a little superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting up of a district nurses joint committee of the Central Council entails a considerable number of statutory safeguards. For example, it would be inconceivable of the Central Council not to proceed to a matter relating to district nurses without consulting the joint standing committee. It would be there to advise the Central Council on matters relating to district nurses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the course of considering mat-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
ters relating to district nurses, that joint committee would obviously wish—I went into this matter during my Second Reading speech in some detail—to consult with all the parties who were interested in the future of district nurse training and matters of that sort. Then the district nurses committee would make recommendations to the Central Council. The Central Council, obviously, would want to satisfy itself that the committee had consulted all the appropriate people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Central Council would then be faced with the question of making rules to put the recommendations of the district nursing committee into operation. Here, I concede that at that stage some adjustment may be needed to make sure that district nurses conform to the overall approach of the Central Council, and the control of education and training of the professions by the Central Council which every member of the Committee has said is a desirable thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules then have to be proposed to the Secretary of State, who is the only person who can promulgate rules through the normal parliamentary procedures, and we have been through that. At that stage, the Secretary of State would want to check to make sure that the district nursing joint committee and the Central Council had consulted all the people they were supposed to have consulted. If he was satisfied, he could then promulgate the rules. So a very substantial number of safeguards for the position of minority groups exists. Although we have been talking of district nurses in setting up these procedures this applies to other groups as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) went a little further when he said that he wanted to know why there was a different approach to health visiting and midwifery from district nurses. In my view, quite frankly, the solution adopted for midwives and health visitors is a less satisfactory solution than the one we are adopting for district nurses. Midwives and health visitors have been written into the face of the Bill because they already had statutory machinery. Therefore, in accepting what they already had, we have provided them with standing committees, written into the Bill, and for these to be a requirement by law. However, that means that it is a fairly rigid and cumbersome solution to their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
There can be no amendment to the broad terms of reference of those midwifery and health visiting committees, or their general sphere of influence in their constituency, without an amendment made by Act of Parliament, because hon. Gentlemen opposite, through this Parliament, quite rightly in my view—particularly the right hon. Member for Wanscead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin)—have been most firm in the belief that no Act of Parliament can be amended by a statutory instrument. On general grounds of principle, I would join with that view. Therefore, that is the position of midwives and health visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were able to make a new start with district nurses and others because at present district nurses do not have a statutory machinery, and therefore it seemed to me to be an ideal opportunity—I believe that I have secured the consent of their representatives on the Briggs co-ordinating committee; at least, they have made no representations to me to the contrary since 27th February, when this broad scheme of legislation was propounded—for them to proceed by means of a statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statutory instrument has the considerable advantage that, broadly speaking, a Minister could guarantee to amend and adjust the district nurses' statutory machinery within any period of 12 months because an amending statutory instrument requires about an hour and a half of parliamentary time for debate. As the right hon. Gentleman for Down, South (Mr. Powell) reminded me, the matter is usually taken very late at night and it provides the minimum problem for the managers of Government business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it will now be borne in on all members of the nursing professions that very different considerations apply when it comes to amending or initiating an Act of Parliament. After all, the nursing professions have been waiting for some six years for this legislative opportunity, and we have managed to get it in this Session. Even so, at one stage there was some considerable danger that it might have been overtaken by a General Election. That did not happen, but we must bear in mind that an election is looming before us. One can never tell what the problems may be, but if, in the fullness of time, it was felt to be generally desirable that the terms of reference of the district nursing committee should expand to take in the problems of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
training and education of, for example, general practitioner nurses, I believe that any Minister could guarantee that that adjustment could be made within a period of about 12 months at the most. It might indeed, with a favourable combination of circumstances, be much shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if one writes the phrase "district nursing joint committee" into the face of the Bill, the only way in which that adjustment could be achieved would be by an amending Act of Parliament. To find parliamentary time for that sort of thing might mean that two, three or perhaps even more years would elapse before a suitable opportunity cropped up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that members of the Committee will dissent when I say that, although the problems of the nursing professions are very dear to all our hearts—we would not be on this Committee if we did not have that attitude—there are other matters which engage our attention from time to time and prevent us occasionally from putting the nursing professions at the top of our priority list when it comes to apportioning parliamentary time. That is a serious consideration. For that reason, I thought that I was doing a considerable favour to district nurses, mental nurses, and any others in putting forward the idea that a statutory instrument should embody their broad terms of reference and their responsibilities instead of writing them into an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have privately expressed the view occasionally to health visitors and mid-wives that they might live to regret the fact that they have an Act of Parliament which embodies their machinery. They may one day say that this is a very rigid and cumbersome form of setting up a committee. I would go a little further and say that, ideally, I should have liked all these committees to have been set up by a resolution of the Central Council, which could be amended, revoked or modified, again by the Central Council, in the normal manner of controlling bodies. But, alas, that was not to be. But I accept that the Bill is a compromise between the various interests in the professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that district nurses are very important. In part of his substantial contribution the lion. Member for Walsall, North emphasised the importance which we attach to district nurses. Indeed, we do. Under the documents " Priorities for the Health and Personal Social Services" and
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
in "The Way Forward", which we have published as guidelines for strategic planning, we sincerely hope that funds for district nursing will, with other community nursing services and health visiting, expand at the rate of about 6 per cent, per annum	<div class='sup'>*</div> <!-- sup --> because we believe that primary health care is one of the most suitable and effective forms of health care that the Health Service can deliver. That is not to say that we shall achieve our ambition, but we shall certainly bend every effort to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we have introduced, as the hon. Member said, a number of improvements in the position of district nurses. For example, at the moment about 25 per cent, of persons acting as district nurses have had no special training in district nursing. They are, in fact, general nurses who have acquired experience in the community. They may well be excellent nurses, but I suggest that it takes longer to produce nurses of that sort than if they have had proper training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, a four-month district nurse training on top of the general nurse training which nurses undertake at the moment, but it is not a mandatory form of training under the present set-up. What we have said is that from 1981 district nurse training will be mandatory. In other words, all nurses, if they want to become district nurses after undergoing their general training, will have to undertake a period of district nurse training. We have decided that it shall not be four months, as hitherto, but for six-months. We have consulted all the health authorities in the United Kingdom about the desirability of these changes, and we have the support of the Health Service for this expanded training. It will be a more thorough training for district nurses and I think that it emphasises the importance that we attach to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Preston, South (Mr. Thorne) asked how the recognition of health visitors and district nurses could undermine the Bill. The answer, of course, is that it cannot. We are making a substantial recognition of the special interests of midwives, health visitors and, in the context of this amendment, district nurses. We are recognising them. We have set up the Central Council's midwifery committee and the committees of the national boards. We propose to set up, during the course of this clause, a health visiting joint committee and we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
made provisions—I have given undertakings which will be carried out—that by statutory instrument there will be a district nursing joint standing committee. But the important thing is that it will be controlled by a statutory committee instrument and not by an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Down, South supported me in my contention that there has been no undue haste in putting forward the Bill. I think we have established that the period of consultation which elapsed between the promulgation of the legislative scheme upon which the Bill is based and publication of the Bill was certainly substantial, to put it at its most conservative. Since then, the periods of time that have elapsed between First Reading and Second Reading and between Second Reading and the commencement of the Committee stage have been fairly normal for legislation of this type. We are now on our fifth Committee sitting with a number of other sittings to come. So in no sense of the word can it be said that the matter has been rushed through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Down, South for his support for the view that we are legislating on a United Kingdom basis and that this will affect Northern Ireland. I am sure that he will make use of that fact in other matters, elsewhere and on other occasions, but I should like to utter the warning that we are not so mesmerised by the doctrine of precedent in the House that, just because we have adopted that approach for this subject, on this occasion, he can assume that all other matters will be dealt with in a similar matter from this time forth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by observing that all but one of the Bills presented to Parliament in this Session, with the exception of the Education Bill, which could not apply to Northern Ireland, have so applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a statement of fact as the right hon. Gentleman sees it. I shall leave him with it because I do not think it is my function to comment on the wider issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a plea from the hon. Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan)
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
for the adjournment of the Committee for further discussions. First of all, we have had the discussions. He divined that I was going to say that and I say it. Certainly, since I have been at the Department of Health and Social Security, we have had the best part of two years, or 18 months, of consultation. The fact that the Bill is now before the House has not stopped the consultation continuing. Since the Bill has been in Committee, I have met the general nurses once, the trade unions involved in the Briggs committee once, and the health visitors and their representatives twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So consultation is still going on and there is no need to adjourn the Committee in order to allow it to take place. In any case, within a matter of a few days, we have a month-long Christmas recess. I am happy to inform members of the Committee that, not only will the recess apply to the House of Commons in general, but it will also apply to the proceedings of the Committee. We shall sit on Thursday morning next, and thereafter we shall not gather again until Tuesday 16th January.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vaughan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that we have now arrived at this clause and all the advice that we get from the Royal College, of Nursing, the midwives, the health visitors and the district nurses is that the clause does not meet their wishes. The only body which has not told us that to date—and I have no idea what its view is on the matter—is the General Nursing Council. What, then, is the Ministers advice to us on the Committee, when all the professional advisers tell us that the clause is unsatisfactory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that direct point, I think I have some advice for the hon. Gentleman. I believe I am right—although I stand to be corrected—that if we had a vote on these amendments and the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends lost, the matter could not be dealt with on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite prepared to concede that perhaps there is still a sense of unease among the various groups of the professions in the country. I am prepared to repeat the undertaking which I gave in general in respect of amendment no. 12, that if the groups represented on the Briggs co-ordinating committee come to me and propose a better way of meeting the problems of these minority groups, I shall give the greatest possible attention to their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V001P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
proposals. I would move amendments on Report to accommodate their sense of unease. If, on that understanding, hon. Gentlemen were to withdraw their group of amendments this morning, we could return to the matter of Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Christmas recess there might be at least three weeks during which consultations could take place. Speaking personally, 1 am willing to meet between Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day, but I hope I shall not be pressed unduly in the matter. Even without that period there would be three weeks for consultations with the professions. If they came forward with some agreed proposal for amendments along those lines, I would have to have regard to them because my board desire throughout the whole of this legislation, provided it is compatible with the public interests, is to try to do what the nursing professions would like to have done. That is the approach I adopted with the Medical Bill, and that is the approach I am adopting here. If they will withdraw the group of amendments now, the hon. Gentleman and his friends could come back to the matter on Report and we could have a debate then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has made a very long and, in many ways, a very persuasive speech about our amendments. I feel—and I think that the Committee will agree—that there is a great deal to be said for not tying ourselves down, or tying the professions down, to statutory requirements. It is very much easier and quicker for specialist bodies such as we have been dealing with to be able to get changes in legislation in the future through Orders in Council. Such a mechanism would give greater flexibility to the professions concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a difference in status here between the midwives and health visitors and the other professional bodies such as the district nurses. This is a matter about which they feel very strongly and may not fully understand. I recognise that the idea is to introduce for the other professions a more flexible mechanism than was available for the midwives and health visitors—and on the Minister's own admission, the solution given to the midwives and health visitors may even to them appear to be less satisfactory in the long run when it comes to working it. While I
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
see the reasoning behind that—and I think the Minister made a very persuasive speech—I still think it is a great pity that all the professions are not dealt with in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason is as follows. The Minister said in a letter dated 30th October 1978 to the secretary of the National District Nurses Action Campaign Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The latter mechanism is more flexible "—</p></blockquote>
that is the mechanism he has prescribed for the district nurses in the Bill, if our amendment is not accepted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and will allow more readily for change—for example, in a committee's remit—to meet the changing needs of the profession."</p></blockquote>
I think that changes may be to the good but not necessarily so in the future. It may be that district nurses see in the flexibility given in the Bill the possibility that their professional status will be weakened considerably by changes and that their independence will be threatened in the future. Therefore, if they do not have the safeguard of a standing joint committee written into the Bill they may well feel that their profession, and the other bodies with which we have not yet dealt, could at some future date be on the way out because they did not have this satisfactory safeguard.

That is a real worry to these professions. They may not understand fully the safeguards of being able to come here so that the House can obtain a change in legislation through the negative order procedure, but what I feel they do understand is when it is stated clearly in a Bill of this kind that they have a right to a joint standing committee of the Central Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that, persuasive though the Minister's arguments were, I am still not persuaded enough that we should not give district nurses a greater undertaking than appears in the Bill as it stands. I hope that we shall have time to return to this matter later in the Bill. I accept what the Minister said, that if we were to press these amendments to a division we should possibly lose the opportunity of being able to discuss them again on Report. That would be a great pity. We need time to reflect on this matter, and the House needs to be able to discuss it again at a later stage.

Nevertheless, I am uneasy about not pressing the amendments, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is still open to persuasion on the undertaking that he has given. He could come back to the point at a later stage if the professions which are not

fully given the status of a standing joint committee by statute are still dissatisfied with the way the Bill is worded, and he could make changes.

My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson), made an excellent speech on the growing importance of the position of district nurses in the community. I would not wish to repeat any of it, except to underline that I think he was absolutely right to say that here is a growing profession whose services are already immensely valuable, will continue to be so and will increase over the years to come.

This has been an important debate. However, I feel very uneasy, despite the Minister's persuasive arguments, at not having had the opportunity to write into the Bill that there will be a statutory joint committee for district nurses and the other
