	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(Permitted hours on weekdays.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Amendment on the Paper in the name of the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams)—in page 2, line 2, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that where the rules of a club so prescribe the break of two hours between three o'clock and five o'clock shall be replaced on every or any week-day by a break of at least two hours at some other part of the day."</p></blockquote>
I should like to ask him whether he intends that proviso to apply to all clubs or merely to clubs in the Metropolis and the large cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HERBERT WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is due to inadvertence that corresponding Amendments have not been put down to paragraph (	<i>b</i>), but if this Amendment is carried, we shall give notice of corresponding Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would not be necessary. All that would be necessary would be that the proviso should go at the end of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) instead of at the end of paragraph (	<i>a</i>). In other words, this is not the proper place for it; it should come later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. ISAAC FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would there be any serious inconvenience if that discussion were taken to-day, if that principle could be discussed, upon the understanding that later there would be a consequential Amendment if the hon. Member's Amendment were carried? The only point is that one has prepared to-day for what would have been a very serious discussion upon the clubs. As far as the small company of us on this Committee are
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
concerned, we should have preferred the club Debate to take place to-day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHN LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should support that course. We have come here to-day ready to discuss that point, and it would be rather inconvenient if we had to discuss some other subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I do not think that is possible. It is clear that if the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams) intends his proviso to apply to all clubs, it can only come at the end of the Clause, after paragraph (	<i>b</i>). In other words, it is now in the wrong place, and, that being so, the first Amendment to-day will be the Amendment for the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. I. Foot), to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point of Order. When should we have the opportunity of discussing our Amendment, in line 2, page 2, with regard to the local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again that would come after paragraph (	<i>b</i>). All these provisos which are intended to apply to the whole Clause must come at the end of the Clause; otherwise they would only apply to a part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of explanation, seeing that no decision has been arrived at in relation to any alteration of hours for the country outside London and the three cities, I had intended that my Amendment should have applied to the three cities that were the subject of our recent discussion, and if that were carried, I should have asked later that there should be some such power applying to the rest of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would not be technically correct. We must have a proviso governing the whole Clause at the end of the Clause, so that if the hon. Member wishes to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>), that is the Amendment that would deal with it, or if he does not move that, it would be his Amendment in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) about altering the hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much regret that the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams) should have put his Amendment in this place on the Order Paper, because he is indeed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>975</span>
upsetting the arrangements that some of us have made in connection with addressing the Committee on this point this morning. It seems to me that the hon. Member, who is so well acquainted with procedure, ought to have known that this proviso should come later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So ought you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is the goose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Chairman, in spite of what my hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Foot) said, is right in his decision. If my hon. Friend's Amendment to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is called, do I understand that we shall fall back once again upon the Amendments on the Paper that have priority in print? In my experience of this House, when we have jumped over Amendments printed on the Paper, we have not been able to go back to Amendments thus jumped over, and I should like that question cleared up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not be going back at all. It is simply that these Amendments are put on the Paper in the wrong place, and clearly the fact that they are going to be put now in the right place will not prejudice them in any way, and they can be discussed in the proper place, which will be after paragraph (	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to my Amendment to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>), I think the principle of it will be raised on the Amendment as to whether there are to be extended hours in London and the three cities, and therefore I do not move it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then the next Amendment to be taken will be the hon. Member's Amendment to leave out "five" and insert "six."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Is it intended on that Amendment to discuss also the next Amendment, which is the argument between 10 and 10.30 p.m.? I think the whole discussion should be one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Surely there are two separate issues here—one whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>976</span>
throughout the country there shall be extended hours, and the other whether the latest permitted, hour is applicable to the country as a whole. The two things, I submit, are quite properly dealt with in two separate Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember that when we discussed this point on paragraph (	<i>a</i>) we decided that they were two points, one dealing with the latest permitted hour and the other with the hours of commencement generally. I think they should be two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 6, to leave out "five," and to insert "six."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are somewhat at a disadvantage, and probably most hon. Members came with the intention of dealing with the very important Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams), but we understand why your Ruling has had to be made, Sir Hugh, and I assume that those other Amendments will be put in their right place, including that in my name and in the names of my hon. Friends, in regard to booking the opinion of the local authority before any alteration is made in any borough. Hitherto, we have been discussing the position in relation to London and the three cities of Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham, but now the Bill comes to deal with what is after all the main part of the country No one would derogate from the importance of London in our national economy, especially on a day like this, when the opinion of the London citizens is being taken upon their own government. None would underestimate the part that is played by the three cities which happen to have a population of over 600,000 but however important this question has been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Some of us are not clear which Amendment is being moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Amendment in page 2, line 6, to leave out "five" and insert "six," and its purpose is that we shall raise the question whether there shall be extended hours in all the country outside London and the three cities. Hitherto, we have done something to put before the Committee the evidence of those three cities speci-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>977</span>
ally affected. The general body of evidence, however, as given before the Royal Commission, remains the same, namely, that there is no substantial public demand for the extension of hours throughout the country. I can understand something being said about the special circumstances of London and of the three great industrial cities, but so far no case has been submitted for extending these drinking hours throughout the country, including, if the Bill passes in its present form, the extreme parts of the country and the scattered rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest permitted hour will be dealt with in the next Amendment, but upon this question, at present, under the Act of 1921, eight hours are allowed, and the magistrates have the power to determine when the break shall take place. I have before given the Committee figures showing that for all practical purposes the great mass of the people throughout the country will be under the eight hour opening rule. There is the power, of course, for the magistrates, if they so decide, to make it eight and a-half hours. There is to be a compulsory break commencing at or after midday. The magistrates are entitled to alter eight to eight and a-half if the circumstances in the locality make that variation from the general rule desirable. Also under Section 3 of the Act of 1921 it is open for the magistrates, to give a further period of time if they think the circumstances justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of this Act as to permitted hours on week-days shall, as respects licensed premises or clubs to which this Section applies, have effect, if the holder of the licence or the committee of the club so elect, as though one hour were added at the end of the permitted hours in the evening."</p></blockquote>
There is provision there, on a special application being made to the justices, to alter the eight or eight and a half hours ordinarily obtaining to nine or nine and a half, that is, if the liquor that is then supplied is also supplied with a meal. Take counties like Huntingdon or Somerset, where there are no big industrial interests, where there are no large communities, where the interest is mainly agricultural, where the magistrates have had the advantage of 12 years' experience and where, according to the evidence available, no demand has been made for extended hours. Why should we, under the guise of standardisation, extend
	<span class='label label-info column'>978</span>
the hours? I think the case for standardisation is very strong. It has probably been strengthened by some recent decisions of the magistrates. At the last sitting of the Committee I referred to what had been done at Black-heath. If standardisation could be secured on the lines of the Royal Commission's recommendations, it would be an advantage, but we strenuously object, and shall continue to object, to any standardisation which really extends licensing hours throughout the conutry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the last occasion the hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Wise) quoted from the Royal Commission the opinion of Mr. Norman Kendal, then a commissioner of police, that he thought 10.30 should be the latest permitted hour in London. Those who are assisting the hon. Member in this matter have very carefully examined the evidence of the Royal Commission and, if there had been anything more valid and tangible to put before the Committee, we should have had it. Against the great body of evidence that I have submitted from those representing other sections of the community, fortified as it was by the evidence of the chief constables from many cities, all the hon. Member was able to produce was the opinion of two leading magistrates and the opinion of Mr. Norman Kendal, who there did not ask for 11 as the latest permitted hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought we were going to be restricted to the discussion of "five" and "six." The hon. Member is now bringing in 11 o'clock at night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not dealing with the principle of 11 o'clock at night. I am speaking of the balance of evidence on one side and the other. As far as I know, there has not yet been submitted to the Committee any scrap of evidence from the Royal Commission showing that, apart from the latest permitted hour, there is any desire for extended hours throughout the country. It is important to remember that, if this Measure is passed, the discretion of the justices in fixing the break in the middle of the day is gone. Does the promoter of the Bill contend that a break that is suitable for one county is necessarily suitable for another? The Bill means that, whatever are the local conditions, conditions which may vary very much from one place to another, the same break is to apply,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>979</span>
Surely in some parts of the country industries are worked on a different basis, the hours of work are different, and all these variations are taken into consideration by the magistrates in arriving at the break. I want to know what information the hon. Member has at his disposal as to the needs of the people throughout the country which should override the decisions that the magistrates have made, in which they have appointed the break which, presumably, is most congenial to the people and most acceptable to the police who have the administration of local affairs and the responsibility for the maintenance of order, and why, having two counties so different as Cornwall and Durham, he should insist that the break that applies in the one district must necessarily apply in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the Bill in its present form, if we decide that houses shall close at the time he has named, three o'clock, and open again at the time he has named, five o'clock, is, first of all, that you will override all local distinctions, that you will put upon a country with great variations of circumstances one strait-waistcoat of uniformity and, besides that, that you will extend the hours. The extension of hours raises a great social problem. One of the real social results of the experiment that was made in the War is that we have been able to secure conditions which have been generally admitted as contributing to the sobriety of the nation. A very serious risk is run by anyone who would seek, without very cogent and overwhelming evidence, to set aside that experience of 12 years. I do not think it would be in order for me to dwell again upon the evidence given by people who came from every part of the land but, until that evidence is met, either by some information which at present is not before the country and before the Committee, or something valid and substantial in the inquiry, of the Royal Commission itself, there is no argument for lengthening the eight hours to 10 hours as the Bill proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill passes in its present form, instead of eight hours in the country it is to be 10, and I should be astonished if there was not opposition to that, not merely by those whose opinion my friends and I represent, but on the part of the police, of the magistrates, whose dis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
cretion would be overborne, and even of those who are working in the licensed trade, who know that for the most part the people have only a limited sum to spend in intoxicating liquor, and that although it may, with the weaker members of the community, those frail people who are most subject to temptation, lead to increased drunkenness and drinking, yet for the most part it would mean that you cannot extend the amount that is to be spent on intoxicating liquor. The agricultural labourer can only spend a very small part of his meagre wage upon intoxacting liquor. It would mean that licence-holders would have their additional overhead charges and they would be deprived of the break, which is of great social value to them, and if their opinion could be taken untrammeled by outside interests and uninfluenced by what may be the demand of the big brewing houses to which they may be tied, upon a free vote of the licensed victuallers throughout the country districts there would be a very large majority against the extension of hours. I have not, in spite of the objection just now, entrenched upon the question of the latest permitted hour, which raises a substantially different issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member made reference to an extension of two hours. This Amendment does not deal with an extension of two hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained on an earlier Amendment that this Amendment was put down for the purpose of raising the question whether there should be extended hours. A similar Amendment was put down in relation to London. The only way in which the whole question could be dealt with would be by taking the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend and myself on the next page.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are only discussing five and six, I suggest that the hon. Member should restrict his remarks to that. He brought in the question of an extension of two hours and, therefore, he is in fact discussing not merely this Amendment but the next, and in that case I suggest that there must be no discussion on the next Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RHYS DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member on more than one occasion has affected
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
to take charge of the task that falls upon the Chairman of telling us when we are in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not gather that. He was asking whether the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. Foot) was strictly in order. I should certainly be delighted if all Members would strictly confine their remarks to the question before the Committee. I am afraid that on a very wide subject of this sort nearly all the speeches seem to me to wander off into other cognate matters. Strictly, we are confined to whether the opening hour shall be five or six and, so far as it is possible, I hope hon. Members will confine themselves to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have been perfectly open to us to put down a series of Amendments altering three o'clock to two and six to five. If we had taken an hour off the earlier break, an hour off the morning and an hour off the evening, that would have made the difference of two hours. At least that is as far as I am able to calculate. If this Amendment were carried, as far as my purpose is concerned, it would mean that we should then be limiting the hours during which houses are to be open and there would probably have to be consequential Amendments. It was really for the convenience of the Committee that we made the suggestion in this form, in order that at some time during our Debates we may be able to discuss what we believe to be a vital and overriding issue, whether or not throughout the great part of the country we shall alter the eight hours which now obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I protest against the patience of the Committee being tried by the hon. Member constantly breaking what I believe to be the Rules of Order. His speech would be in order on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." His suggestion to embody two hours by introducing an Amendment does not bear examination. Even then he would only be able to discuss the question of one additional hour. I suggest that those who stand for teetotalism should indicate some capacity to discuss the matter intelligently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not think that the hon. Member was unduly straying beyond the Amendment, but I
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
would remind Members of the Committee of the fact that, when we were discussing the same point when it referred to the big cities and to London, a very wide discussion indeed took place. A great many instances were given which referred solely to the country. As we had such a very wide discussion on that point, and undoubtedly referred to the country in that discussion, I hope that this discussion will be more confined within strict limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would accept anything from you, Mr. Chairman, but the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams) can put his objection in such an offensive manner, suggesting, of course, that the intelligence is confined to South Croydon and its representative, that I do not propose to alter my line of conduct in this Committee by any suggestion which he cares to make. It is unfortunate that the man who puts himself before the Committee as a model of intelligence should have confused every Member of the Committee by not being able to understand an elementary point in submitting his Amendment and the place where it should be made in the Bill. I have not this morning gone back over the body of evidence which dealt with the whole country. I said just now that I had been given the opportunity of putting evidence which dealt largely with the country, and I contented myself by making a general reference to it here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal more evidence could be adduced, but I will content myself with submitting the Amendment in the hope that those who think that there should be some change in London and that there are some special circumstances in the three great cities, will yet decide that they will not assist in dislocating all the arrangements which have been built up as a result of the 12 years' experience, unless there is submitted to the Committee and to the country a great deal of evidence which has not yet even been begun. No attempt has been made to show that there is any public demand behind this substantial alteration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. JOHN LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to waste the time of the Committee. The Amendment is a simple one, and the provisions of the Bill are equally simple. By the terms of the Bill, if the Measure is carried into law, there will be a fixed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
break hour in the afternoon from 3 to 5, and in the country the hours from then onwards will be till 11 o'clock in the Metropolis, and till half-past 10 o'clock in the country. The hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. Isaac Foot) asked me about the break hours and why it was that we proposed to fix the same break hours everywhere. The short answer is that, unless you have the same break hours, you cannot possibly standardise the hours. If you allow the magistrates to fix the break hour at any other time than between the times proposed—between 3 and 5—you will have exactly what this Bill tries to stop. You will have public houses opening at different times, which the promoters of the Bill think are very inconvenient as far as the public are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether the hour should be 5 or 6 o'clock, I do not propose at the moment to go into the question of whether or not any extended hours are necessary throughout the country, because I think we shall have an opportunity of discussing that matter on the next Amendment. The hours suggested in the Bill during which the licensed premises should be reopened in the country are five or, it may be, 5.30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or six.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or six. If we are to get the standardisation which we want, we must fix the hours of opening at the same time. In that case we should have made it half-past five everywhere, or five, or six. As far as the promoters of the Bill are concerned, we candidly confess that, where it comes to a case of standardisation and where it is a case of effecting it, either increasing the hours or decreasing them, we propose to increase them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By two hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By two hours, if it is necessary for standardisation. That is openly and honestly the intention of the promoters. Therefore, in order to standardise, whether it is a question of opening from six o'clock onwards, or from five o'clock, the promoters of the Bill frankly say that they would prefer to see an extra hour. That is why it has been fixed at five. In those circumstances I am certain that the Members of the Committee will support the pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
moters of the Bill and will vote strongly against this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman who is promoting this Bill is quite frank about its intentions. It is all to the good under this form of Parliamentary government in this country that we should know exactly where our people stand in promoting Measures. The hon. Gentleman has told us that he is primarily after standardisation, but he does not want standardisation unless he gets an extension of hours as well. That, in short, is his case. I think that we have already decided that standardisation is not possible, anyhow. [An Hon, Member: "No."] Of course we have. We have decided to put London, Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham into a different category, but as to the other part of the country I confess right away that I do not think that, from the habits of the people of this country, standardisation throughout the land is possible at any hour. I think that that fact is understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of Manchester and the City of Liverpool differ in their habits, especially in the centre of the city, from the habits of the surrounding districts—the mining districts and the engineering districts and so forth. Therefore, we come to the point that standardisation in the country is impossible. The hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. Foot) brings us down to one point of standardisation. He wants the opening on the second occasion during the day to be at six o'clock universally outside those four cities. In order not to be called to order by the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams) I propose to read the provision as it would appear if the Amendment were carried. This is how it would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hours during which intoxicating liquor may be sold or supplied on weekdays in any licensed premises or club for consumption either on or off the premises shall be as follows, that is to say:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"For any licensed premises or club situated elsewhere from eleven o'clock in the morning till three o'clock in the afternoon, and from six o'clock till half-past ten o'clock in the evening."</p></blockquote>
That is how the Bill would read if the Amendment were carried. The hon. Member for Bodmin knows that I do not approach this problem exactly from the same angle as he does, and certainly not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>985</span>
from the same angle as the noble Lady the Member for Sutton (Viscountess Astor). I am very anxious that nothing is being done to find out what is to happen to the men and women who are employed behind the counter in supplying this drink.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So am I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that the noble Lady is not interested, but I am sure that she is not quite as interested in this problem as I am, because I earn my livelihood very largely in championing the cause of those people, and she enjoys a livelihood without championing anybody's cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She does it for the love of the thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She does it on principle. I want to inform the promoters of the Bill that what I have said does not indicate any quarrel on this side of the Committee in regard to the Bill. On the main objects of the Bill we are presenting a united front, and we are putting a bit of backbone into it too. What is the reason for opening a public house at all? The hon. Gentlemen who support this Bill say that it is for the convenience of the customer. I deny the right of the consumer so to make his demands that the hours of labour and the conditions of those who supply him with commodities may be adversely affected by his demands. Hon. Gentlemen in this Committee always assume that the only people who matter in this business are the people who call at the clubs and the pubs. I do not think that they are the only people who matter. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Dobbie) belongs to the railway service, and I am sure of one thing, that the National Union of Railwaymen would declare its policy and fight for its rights on behalf of the members of the Union, irrespective of anything which the community wanted them to do, if the community wanted the members of the National Union of Railwaymen to work for 12 hours a day. The National Union of Railwaymen would say, "We do not mind what the community want. We look after the interests of our members." The same thing applies exactly in the Co-operative movement, with which I am connected. I am connected with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>986</span>
trade union covering co-operative employés. It is commonly known that the community, so called, would come into co-operative shops at 10, at 11 o'clock, or even at midnight, and if the shops were open at night every day, and on Sundays as well, there would always be somebody in the name of the consuming public calling in for half a pound of butter or a quarter of a pound of bacon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WISE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many hours are the shops open?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The co-operative shops are open for 48 hours as the maximum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CLARRY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Per day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forty-eight hours per week. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have had more intelligence than to have asked that. I should have thought that the interruption, the ignorance of an interruption of that kind, would have come from South Croydon. I am concerned, therefore, with what is going to happen in regard to the hours of the people who are serving this commodity in public houses and clubs. Let me turn to the remarks of the promoter of the Bill. I should like once again to say something about him at which I have just hinted—that I am very pleased with his frankness on this Bill. He makes no secret of the fact that he wants more facilities for drinking in this country, and I do not think I am offending him when I say that, if he could manage to extend the hours of drinking by the community, with the result that more of this drink would be consumed, he would not in the least mind if the brewers' profits went up as a consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are already increased from £9,000,000 to £16,000,000 a year since the War.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Noble Lady will enlighten the Committee on the finances of the brewing trade when the opportunity arises, but I want to safeguard my right as a Member of the Committee, because, with all these interruptions, I am beginning to get a little nervous. The public houses and clubs are open for the sale of drink, and we want to limit the number of hours during which they are to be open. If the hon. Gentleman had not given the game away, I think he must, in the logic of things, agree with us that, so long as he is out for standard-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>987</span>
isation, there is no better method of standardisation than to say that in all the territory outside these four cities no public house or club shall open until six in the afternoon. Let me ask him one question. What made Parliament decide that the hours of opening and closing public houses and clubs should be limited? I do not think it is too much to say that even members of the public who take a little too much drink would themselves like to see the clubs and the pubs closed, so that the invitation would not be open to them to spend on drink money that would be better spent at home. I know men who take too much drink and who would be glad to see these places closed so that they would not be invited to go into them at all. Hon. Members laugh, but they do not know the working classes as well as I do—[Hon. Members: "Oh!"] That sort of notion about public houses and clubs is not confined to the working classes. I know some rich men who would be better if they kept out of this business altogether, because they have brought poverty on their families by spending too much money on drink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This reduction of the number of hours during which public houses and clubs are to be opened will affect the number of hours during which the people behind the bars will be employed. I said something the other day about the hours of labour of people employed in the licensed and catering trade, and you ruled, Sir Hugh, that we were not entitled to discuss the hours of labour on that Amendment; but I am sure I am well within my rights in saying that the hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Wise) quoted the best side of this case when he quoted the figures that he gave. I have the evidence here. I may say that I spent nearly two years on a House of Commons Select Committee inquiring into the wages and conditions of those employed in the distributive and kindred trades, and I assure the hon. Member that Parliament is never called upon to pass legislation to deal with the best employers. Parliament is always called upon to deal with those culprits who will break any law, custom or habit that prevails in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience in every walk of life the vast majority of employers in this country need no law to govern the condi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
tions under which their employés are engaged. Laws are passed because there are about 5 or 10 per cent, of employers—and this applies also to the licensed trade—who will not play the game at all towards their employés. I have in mind a case in point, where, if it were a common case, Parliament would be literally staggered at the conditions under which some of these people are employed. It is that of a barman in London having a notice plastered on the wall of his bedroom in the most offensive terms I have ever seen. One might imagine that we were living in Egypt, Persia, or Afghanistan—that he was an ordinary Egyptian being told by a pasha what he ought to do. He was told on this notice that, no matter what he did in his employment, when he was sacked he would not get unemployment benefit, and he did not get unemployment benefit until a Member of Parliament intervened on his behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RUTHERFORD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. May I ask what this has to do with the question of closing at five or six o'clock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said the other day, it seems to me to be obvious that, if the hours during which public houses are to be open are to be extended, it probably will have some effect on the hours during which the people who work in those public houses have to work, so that, up to a point, as I said the other day, this matter is relevant. But, as I ruled the other day, we cannot go into the whole question of the conditions of labour in the licensed trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always agreed to your Ruling on this question, but I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's protest. The right hon. Gentleman representing the Home Office will know that the Home Office during the last 50 years, from the time of Sir Charles Dilke, have never dealt directly with the hours of labour of shop assistants. What they have done has been to limit the hours during which the doors of the shops were open, because, incidentally, the earlier closing of the shop door automatically worked in favour of a reduction of the hours of labour of shop assistants. When the Home Office has introduced Bills dealing with the closing of shops it has done so frankly in order to affect favourably the hours of labour of shop
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
assistants, and when the House of Commons has discussed those Measures it has alway been undertood that Members were entitled to deal with the hours of labour of shop assistants, merely because the closing of the shop door affected those hours of labour. I am very pleased that you have ruled in that way, because the hours at which the door of the public-house is opened and closed would determine very largely the number of hours worked by the people behind the bars of those places, and, consequently, I think I am entitled to use this argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very anxious, as I have said, to see that the hours of labour of these people are improved, and I am under the impression—I may be wrong—that to reduce the number of hours during which drink is sold and consumed on the premises may reflect favourably on the number of hours worked by the people behind the bars and in the clubs. Hon. Members have argued as if the people employed in these public-houses are something more than employés, but the ordinary licensee is as much a servant of the brewer railwayman, or a barman, or a shop assistant is a servant. I have 11 clubs in my Parliamentary Division, and the stewards of those clubs are employed just as ordinary servants. Their conditions of employment are very much the same, and they have not the remotest say in the conduct of the business so far as I know. I have had a word with one or two publicans myself, and they have asked me not to stand up for this Bill, because it will increase their hours of labour in the public-houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the case as I see it in connection with opening these places at five or six in the afternoon. Take the consumers' hours of labour if you like. I do not know what happens in Smethwick, or Bodmin, or Plymouth, but I know what happens in Lancashire and South Wales. The colliers work, in general, eight hours a day. If they start at two in the afternoon, they cannot enter a pub or a club at five or six. Some of them finish at 10 at night, and very few of them who drink at all would call at a pub or club then. Consequently, you can go round the 24 hours. But the textile operatives in Lancashire finish at five in the afternoon, and I venture to say that 90 or 95 per cent, of them, if the pubs and clubs were open all day
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
long, would walk straight to their homes for a decent meal. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If hon. Members did more to improve their conditions of employment and their hours and wages there would be no necessity to say "Shame." I thought that this was a free assembly, where the man might speak his mind, and if hon. Gentlemen want a little more truth probably they can get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal further with the people who are supposed to be the consumers, the community—the consuming Community in whose favour we are supposed to be arguing. Take the textile operatives. They finish, as a rule, at five in the afternoon. Hon. Gentlemen are quite frank and open about what they want. They want the clubs and the pubs to open just in time for the thousands who come out of the factory gates to walk straight into a pub or a club. Hon. Members say "Hear, hear!" and I am very pleased with their frankness—their brutal frankness. I would not like to suggest that any of them has shares in any brewery, but, anyway, we are entitled in the name of good behaviour in the community to say that we will not deliberately open these places right in front of the factory gates and invite people to spend their wages and incomes in these places instead of taking them home. I hoped that hon. Members would say "Hear, hear!" to that, but they are very silent on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad, Sir Hugh, that you are keeping these two conflicting forces in tow, so that they may be silent while I am trying to deliver my speech. Let me refer to another type of persons who will be affected by the opening of these places at six instead of five. I would guarantee that in the warehouses and offices of Manchester there are about 200,000 people who come into the city from outside areas—from Altrincham, from Cheadle and Gatley, and, indeed, I could almost name all the villages and towns outside Manchester from which these people come to follow their employment in industry. Do hon. Gentlemen really want men or women employed in warehouses in Manchester—those huge places in Portland Street, and Dale Street and Market Street—when they have finished their work in these places, to walk straight into a pub or a club for a drink before they get home for a meal? If they make that suggestion, I really must tell them that I think their minds are very depraved. I think their attitude of mind conflicts entirely with that of the average employer. The average employer, in this country at any rate, wants sober workmen, and, if I might say so, the capitalist employer, in the main, does not like his workpeople to spend too much of their money on drink. In this Committee, however, we have not got the average employer at all. We have men here who are members of county families, landowners, people who have a little invested here and there, and all the rest of it. They have not the remotest—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. WISE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Are the pedigrees of the Committee relevant to this Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to standardise their pedigrees—tlheir trees of genealogy, if that is the correct word.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. BROCKLEBANK</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Will not anomalies be caused if that is the fact?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill itself is an anomaly, and if it should ever become law, there will be more anomalies still under it. The hon. Member said that his Bill was a very simple one, but I have never seen a Bill introduced into this House which aims at an object that it will never achieve like this one. It aims at standardising the hours of drink in this country, and the hon. Gentleman himself told us that it falls foul of that objective in two ways. First of all, it will not achieve its object because he has divided the country into two sections. He has given facilities for London and the three cities that he has not given for the other parts of the country. He calls them facilities. I rather like the vocabulary of the brewing interests. It is very choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. The question of standardisation between one part of the country and another does not arise on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad I am talking under two Chairmen at the same time. I would appeal to the hon. Member that this Committee is literally wasting its time on a Bill that has not the slightest chance of becoming law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GLOSSOP</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in a difficulty, because on a similar Amendment in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) I voted for those hon. Members who oppose the Bill because I thought that five o'clock was too early for licensed premises to open, but that Amendment, which was to open at six o'clock, was not carried. My view is that there are many Members on this Committee who really want to standardise the hours. There may be some who want to see greater facilities for drinking, but the extremists in that direction are balanced by the extremists in the other direction, who wish that it might be possible to make the country entirely dry. I think the major portion of the Committee really desire to see a standardisation of hours. After I had supported that Amendment with regard to opening at six, I discovered that I had been voting to create definite hardships in a great many parts of the country. I found, on going into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
figures when I got home, having more time then, that in nine of the principal boroughs in Yorkshire they open at 5.30 and that in 38 other licensing areas in Yorkshire they open at 5.30, and there was I supporting an Amendment to open at six, and really doing a great deal of harm, if it had been carried, to people residing in those areas who presumably desire to continue opening at 5.30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of whether or not it is good for them to have licensing facilities at 5.30, I would give the figures for drunkenness in those nine boroughs and 38 other licensing areas in Yorkshire. In 1925 there were 4,737 convictions for drunkenness and in 1933 they had gone down to 2,106, so I think that shows that temperance propaganda, and very useful propaganda too, can induce people to become temperate, even if there are reasonable facilities for drinking, and that it is not necessary, in order to achieve reasonable temperance in the country, to restrict the hours of opening. I therefore find myself in the position that I cannot support the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. Foot), because it would create a great hardship in my own county of Yorkshire; yet, on the other hand, I cannot support the Bill with regard to opening at five o'clock, so I have handed in a manuscript Amendment—I apologise to the Committee for not having put it on the Raper—to leave out "five" and insert "five-thirty." The object of my Amendment would be to enable a great many parts of the country which open at 5.30 to carry on as at present, and in order to achieve my object, I shall have to vote for the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bodmin, so as to secure that my Amendment shall subsequently be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member kindly tell me the area covered by his figures just now? Is it the whole county, or only one of the Ridings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GLOSSOP</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It concerns nine boroughs in Yorkshire and 38 other licensing areas. I am afraid I do not know the total number of licensing areas in Yorkshire, but probably the hon. Member himself knows it already. I think there are a great many Members of this Committee who support the Bill, not because they want to see either less or greater facilities for drinking, but because they are anxious to secure a reasonable
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
standardisation of hours. I think there must be many hon. Members who have the same views as those which were reported on Monday last to have been expressed by the Reverend Verney L. Johnstone, Vicar of St. Gabriels, Newcastle, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have never been able to understand why it should be considered sinful to drink a glass of beer, and perfectly virtuous to consume quantities of that poisonous liquid called strong tea. I think strong tea must do much more harm to a person's system than a glass of beer. For myself, I much prefer the good fellowship of men at a pub. to the awful scandalmongers of the average tea table."</p></blockquote>
I think there are many people who hold that viewpoint. If the public houses open at 5.30 instead of five, it does not necessarily mean that the people will go into them in order to drink. I believe they go in largely for the companionship which they are able to get, and I hope that those who agree with me will support the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bodmin, in order to support mine later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Member ever thought why it is that the only trades in the country that have to be controlled are the drink trade and the drug trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Drink and drugs are the only things ever since there have been drink and drugs, that have had to be controlled by the State. We talk about the evils of tea drinking, and they may or may not be evils, but I would like to bring the hon. Member back to the point. It is rather amusing, but it is not worthy of hon. Members, who come here to legislate on things that are affecting not a few people only, but thousands of people. Although we laugh a good deal about it, this Bill would be a very serious thing for the country if it were passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. May I appeal to you, Sir Hugh, that obviously what the Noble Lady is saying has nothing to do with the Clause 1 She is making a Second Reading speech.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is whether it is on the hon. Member's side or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was getting to the point of the seriousness of the increased hours of drinking, and that has to do with the Amendment. The promoter of the Bill said that its provisions are very simple, but I am afraid the hon. Member is more simple than his Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
and I am certain that he would find that, even if the Bill got through the Committee, it could never get through the House of Commons, because we all know—we have had the evidence put before us by my hon. Friends the Members for Bodmin (Mr. Foot) and Westhoughton (Mr. Rhys Davies)—that there is no desire in the country for an extension of two hours for drinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. On several previous occasions I have raised the point whether it is permissible, on an Amendment dealing with the limitation of one hour, to raise the question of two hours, and you have already ruled that it is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly it is technically out of order, but if I were to get up and stop hon. Members at every moment when they strayed strictly beyond the lines of order, I should be on my feet the whole time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing with the point that the promoter of the Bill had admitted that it would increase the hours of drink by one hour. My hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Foot) then said, "Two hours," and the promoter said, "Yes." Hon. Members opposite know that this Bill cannot standardise the hours. There is no such thing as standardisation. It has been proved over and over again that you cannot do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Noble Lady is saying something that she believes to be true, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a point of Order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I think it ought to be understood that I have never said, nor has anybody else, that it was impossible to standardise the hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of Order. It was an interruption, and for some reason the Noble Lady seems to invite interruption from other Members. I hope they will not interrupt her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Sir Hugh; I do seem to invite interruptions. I have always found that, if you say something that is true and not pleasant, people get riled, but, if you say things that are not true, no matter how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
unpleasant, people do not mind. Very often I have to say things which are unpleasant but true, but I get a rise, particularly from the hon. Member for South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams). Hon. Members admit that this is to extend drinking for two hours. It will not get through the House of Commons and it will not get through the country. I want to bring some evidence of the effect of the extension of hours on the social life of the country as affecting women and children. I am not going to bring the evidence of fanatics, teetotallers or people who inhabit public houses, but of some of those who are dealing with, women and children in crowded areas. It is evidence that came before the Licensing Commission from the principal of the National Children's Home and Orphanage. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have constant and abundant evidence of the close connection between drinking and child destitution. Very many of the children in the home at the present time would not be in our care but for intemperance on the part of one or sometimes both parents."</p></blockquote>
She quoted from a school teacher of long experience:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The closing of the public house at 10 o'clock at night"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Again I protest. The Noble Lady is referring to closing at 10 o'clock on an Amendment dealing with five and six. Hon. Members should be made to observe the same Rules of Order that we have to observe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Chairman to judge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I mentioned 10 o'clock. I really meant to say the increased hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"The closing of the public house at 10 o'clock at night has been of untold benefit to the children. In homes of one or two rooms the children's bedtime coincided with the closing of the public house. Babies and children used to be in the streets until midnight and later and now all is quiet at 10.30 p.m. except in the height of summer."</p></blockquote>
This is from the evidence of Mrs. Sewell:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have consulted many district nurses and they agree with me that one of the first things to fail in a drinking home is the milk ration The larger the publican's bill the smaller, too often, is the dairyman's. The amount of alcoholic liquor still taken is a perpetual drag on child welfare. Earlier closing has most certainly helped sobriety. From the district nurses' point of view, the later hours are always responsible for so
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
much unrest. Of course, it is extremely bad for the children to hear rowdy noises in the street and to have disturbance caused by parents perhaps not always inebriated but far too merry."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RUTHERFORD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Noble Lady referring to noises between five and six?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I was referring to the extension of hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was giving the Noble Lady a great deal of latitude because I thought probably it would be the best way of getting on with the business of the Committee, but she is clearly dealing now with the latest permitted hour, which is not this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with the extension of hours. I have before me heart-breaking letters from working mothers and those living in crowded areas. Hon. Members must realise that, if after 11 years the country still adheres to these hours, it is not chance. It must be something fundamental in the desire of the great mass of the people to go on with the social service which has given us limited hours. Ever since the War we have had an agitation against the restriction of hours. An hon. Member opposite has said he wants public houses always open. They admit it quite freely. But there is no desire for it in the country. We had the evidence last year of the trade, who are really in their hearts backing the Bill. They had a great meeting at the Albert Hall to do away with D.O.K.A. There were to be 200 Members of Parliament and the mayors of all the boroughs. It was advertised up and down. The papers, of course, were in league with it. A great many of the papers are in league with the trade. They had a very poor meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GLOSSOP</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Noble Lady tell me whether there is any truth in the statement that one of the reasons why the Albert Hall was so empty on that occasion is that a great many of the teetotalers' associations bought great blocks of seats in order to keep the place empty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows that the teetotal organisation do not spend £1,000,000 a year on advertising. There is no great mass of wealthy teetotal people. The hon. Member is up against the spiritual consciousness of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
people of the country, and that is far stronger than anything that the trade can buy or produce, even if they get the whole of the Press and every Member of Parliament behind them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. The hon. Member, in putting a question to the Noble Lady, has made a very serious suggestion. Can he substantiate the suggestion that people bought seats?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not a point of Order. Clearly we cannot get into a discussion whether or not the temperance societies bought up seats in the Albert Hall. The Noble Lady really must confine herself to the Amendment and not get on to these outside questions, which only cause interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This great meeting in the Albert Hall was for the extension of hours and yet it was a complete failure and flopped. That in itself shows that, although they are fighting hard against D.O.R.A. and for the extension of hours, even with all the money that the trade is prepared to spend, they will not get it. We as a House of Commons have to think of something even more important than the appetites of certain men or the profits of the brewing trade. Twenty per cent, of the children entering elementary schools are physicaly defective. Longer hours mean the spending of more on drink and less on milk. We have 400,000 children under five, and 1,000,000 under 14 in overcrowded areas where the public house is the one warm, well kept and well lighted place. Do hon. Members really want that to go on? If they do not, they must think seriously before going on with the Bill. They say they want the liberty of the working man. Would they give the working man the liberty of voting for drink? An hon. Member opposite says no. He does not agree with local option. We have heard all this nonsense from time immemorial. The fight for the extension of hours has nothing to do with the liberty of the working man, but it may seriously effect the liberty of his children because, if you further increase in these poverty-stricken areas the facilities for drink and decrease the money spent on milk and proper food, you are doing a grave injustice to yourself and to the country which you come
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
here in the name of patriotism to represent. I beg the Committee to think of it from the point of view of the welfare of the children. By now the Committee know pretty well that the Bill has been exposed and shown up in its true light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that I have been most grateful for since I came to the House of Commons is that I am a woman of independent means, because it means that you can represent any one you like without having to be paid for it. Yet I am glad that there are men in the House of Commons who, owing to their knowledge of these things, are able to come here and give evidence from the inside. But I do not know of any big employer on the Committee who would be in favour of an extension of hours. There are only two kinds of people in the country who want to increase the hours of drink. One is the great drink trade whose profits have increased from £9,000,000 to £16,000,000 since the War. No other trade can say that. The others are a few people who would be far better not drinking. Certainly the women and children are not for it. I have here a newspaper placard with the words "Do women terrify M.P.'s on the Drink Bill?" Of course they do, and they will terrify you more and more. Take my advice and drop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done my best to avoid interrupting the Noble Lady, but certain things she has said I must answer. She is always so inclined to assume, in addressing the Committee, that her own knowledge of the working classes, and her own spiritual feelings, are so completely above and beyond those of the ordinary Member on the other side, that I think it is necessary to respond, although very gently, to the rather lofty moral attitude which she has adopted. She challenged me on the question of local option and said the promoters of the Bill would not trust the working classes sufficiently to vote for local option. It is true that I would not trust the teetotallers sufficiently to give them an opportunity to vote whether other people shall drink. That, after all, is supporting the liberty of the subject to drink or teetotal, as he or she wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no such verb as to teetotal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it, and the hon. Member can now use it himself. The Noble Lady says there is no serious evidence anywhere in favour of an extension of these hours. The Noble Lady has talked to us about Albert Hall meetings, but has she considered her own constituency and whether there is any demand for an extension of hours in Plymouth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She has, but it may interest the Committee to know that I have a little evidence before me to-day. I have the evidence of no fewer than 6,000 signatories from the Sutton Division of Plymouth, collected in the course of the last week, asking for an extension of the permitted hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say whether any or all of those voted for the Noble Lady at the last election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a ballot secret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously that is not a matter we made inquiries about. Why should we? What has it to do with this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman come down to Plymouth and fight me on this question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An HON. MEMBER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will not have a party if this goes on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might equally suggest that the Noble Lady should come down from Plymouth to South-East Essex and fight me there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will fight the hon. Member there at a by-election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Noble Lady may come along at the next election if she wants to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some information as to the way in which these signatures have been collected. Is the hon. Gentleman willing to hand over the papers to us for examination before the next Debate takes place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RAIKES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I only take those figures at their face value, but they are very interesting as showing what the spirit of Plymouth may be. I have risen to contradict the Noble Lady in regard to the question of evidence. Surely, 6,000 persons in the Sutton Division of Plymouth are considerably better evidence than the heart of the Noble Lady's own teetotal abode, than vague reference to meetings at the Albert Hall, and vague posters which she holds up about women terrifying Members of Parliament. As a matter of fact, a very considerable number of women signed this petition. I feel that the Noble Lady, in spite of what she has said about evidence, and in spite of her general attitude of superiority in regard to knowledge of the working class, has, at any rate, perhaps slightly exaggerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscountess ASTOR</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never talk about my superior knowledge, but I believe that I know more about what women want and what working women need than the hon. Gentleman opposite. I do not claim to be spiritually superior, but I honestly think—and after all I have been in the House of Commons for 15 years—that I have a little experience of things which the hon. Member has not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RICHARD RUSSELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The outstanding fact in regard to the effect of the Bill in the constituencies is that it has brought an avalanche of opinions from the constituencies to each one of us. At the right time and place one would have no hesitation in producing evidence against the Bill from the trade, industry, the homes, the schools and every other class of the community. I ask the Committee to come back to the very grave question of the effect of this particular Clause on industry in our Divisions. I am concerned about the effects of this Clause, or the Amendment, whichever is carried, upon the industry which I happen to represent in this House. I was glad to find that the hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. Glossop) proposes to support the Amendment because of certain reasons of his own. I hope that before I sit down he will be able to add reasons which I will give him from my standpoint. I represent in this House a constituency providing the greatest output of milk in the world. We have the most dense population.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1003</span>
What is going to be the effect of either the Amendment or the Clause upon the milk industry? What is the position? We have to send that most important commodity into London for the children of schools and other purposes. How does it get to London? First of all, the men have to go into the shippens and milk the cows. The milk has to be cooled, and then to be transported, and every one of these operations has to be done with the utmost care. What has that to do with this question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RUSSELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be able to show that it has a great deal to do with the question whether the hour of opening of public houses should be five or six o'clock. When do they start those operations? Either at three or four o'clock. It is most important that there should be nothing to interfere with, or to take away from, the concentration of effort on our farms between the hours of three and six o'clock. It is very important for the milk supply of London that we should not make the hour five o'clock, as it would conflict with the most important hour in the dairying districts in this country. Rather should we make it six o'clock. I hope that we shall get away from the point of view of the so-called extremists on either side. Why hon. Gentlemen on the other side should refer to us as extremists as if there were not extremists on their side, I do not know. The point I am making is not what is to be the effect of this Measure elsewhere, but what is to be its effect in my constituency, and as I have overwhelming evidence that it will do harm, I support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RUTHERFORD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have suddenly realised how ill-thought-out the Amendment really is. Some hon. Members who put down Amendments seem to forget the fact that there is a vast area on the fringe of London which will come within the six o'clock area if the Amendment is carried. At the present time the opening hour in my constituency is five-thirty, and it would surely be a monstrous thing if we were in this Committee to say that, after that hour has worked satisfactorily for so many years, and after convictions have steadily decreased in the course of those years, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
should not continue that satisfactory state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is a monstrous thing that my Amendment should interfere with that five-thirty arrangement, is it not also a monstrous thing that the hon. Member should support a Measure which would interfere with existing arrangements in the main part of the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. RUTHERFORD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Sir, because the Amendment which the hon. Member is putting forward would, if it were carried, restrict and close public houses which are now open. All that we seek to do is to open the houses which are now shut. As has already been pointed out, there is no compulsion to go into a public house merely because it is open. There are a great many people who have to go into market towns and so forth for their business, and assuming, for the sake of argument, that it is not market day, when the extension is on during the whole of the day, those people would be forced under the Amendment to wait until six o'clock before they went home. A futher increase of the inconvenience to the public would result from this Amendment. The point was made that people only have a certain amount of money to spend upon liquor and that the Bill will make them spend more. If they have not got more money to spend, how can they spend more? On the other hand, why not let them spend it in a longer time rather than make them hurry in order to finish drinking? Why force then to drink hurriedly with the harmful results of which we all know? If the Noble Lady believes that the work which she has carried on is right, and that she has achieved any success, surely, she must have sufficient faith in her work to know that the people among whom she has worked and whom she has attempted to educate are to be trusted not to drink too much merely because the public house is open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is that in the name of the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. Foot)—In page 2, line 6, to leave out "half-past."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. The Committee have been dealing with a very big subject this morning, and it is now Nine Minutes to One. I am wondering whether it is fair to the Committee to open up another very important question at this late hour, and I suggest that we might adjourn now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to ask the Committee whether or not it would be possible for them to sit this afternoon. I have two reasons for doing so. The first is that, as we appreciate and understand, you, Sir Hugh, were unable to be here on Thursday of last week and Tuesday this week, so that we have missed two days. The second reason is</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if it is decided that the word "five" shall not stand part of the Clause. Then "5.30" will be voted upon. Of course, if the Committee decide that the word "five" is to remain, that will dispose of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 20: Noes, 14.</p>
	<p>that there are many Bills coming on which are being rather held up, and one appreciates the point of view of those whose Bills would come on. In these circumstances, I would ask you, Sir Hugh, if you could see your way to presiding over the Committee this afternoon, so that we might continue our proceedings?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before that point is further discussed, may I say that the hon. Member, who, of course, has shown great moderation so far, must have "gone off the deep end" now in suggesting—[Hon. Members: "No!"]—must have shown some temerity, if I may use that expression instead of the other, in making this proposal? The Bill, of course, has been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Is there a formal Motion before the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; there is what I consider to be a point of procedure before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a pity it was that during the interval of two days your position was not taken by the sub-chairman of this Committee, who now represents South Croydon (Mr. H. Williams). It is true that some time has been taken over the Bill, but so far we have made no suggestion of obstruction or undue prolongation of the proceedings against the other side, and that suggestion has not been made against us. The fact that there was this interval last week could not be helped. The other side might have raised an objection, but it was readily accepted in order that your convenience should be met. This afternoon matters of grave importance are being raised in the House. There are Members here who have their interest in questions, and there are Members of the official Opposition, who represent only a very small number in the House, and who would like to be in their places, as the rest of us do. Further, I would point out that the Debates on the Bill in the Committee have had to be extended because of alterations made by the hon. Member following upon the Second Reading. Very important alterations have had to be made, and that necessarily involves longer discussion. I think that, if it were intended that the Committee should sit in the afternoon, it would be resented by those who are opposing the Bill, and it would not be our desire in that event, as it has been all along, to help to secure a quorum in the morning and to facilitate the discussion of these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can shorten the discussion by saying that I have to tell the Committee that I could not possibly be here this afternoon. I have engagements outside the House to which I must attend. On the point which has been raised, it will be remembered that the Committee on Procedure, which sat, I think, during the last Parliament, and of which the hon. Member for Westhoughton (Mr. Davies) was a member, recommended that as far as possible it was undesirable that Committees should be sitting while the House was sitting. At the same time it is often done. For the moment, all I can say is that I could not possibly attend myself this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVIES</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel sure that the Committee would at any rate want you to occupy the Chair during our deliberations. I want to take up one point that was made by the promoter. He is very solicitous about the progress of other Bills, but he has a very simple way open to him. I have been astonished, after the very gallant fight that he has made for his Measure, and knowing the consequences of the Bill, he does not now say that he will drop the Measure in order to facilitates the other Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or they might be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I move, "That the Committee do now adjourn?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say another word on the point with which I was dealing. If the hon. Member in charge of the Bill now gives the Committee notice that he intends to raise this matter, and move at our next meeting a Motion that in future the Committee should sit in the afternoon, I cannot stop him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will allow a Debate upon it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should allow a short Debate upon it, and, of course, it would have to be put as a question when the Committee adjourned after the next meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your suggestion is that if at our next meeting, which will be next Tuesday, a proposal were made that we should sit on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons as well as on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, you would allow a vote to be taken on that proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; I have no power to stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. FOOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not discuss it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LOCKWOOD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly satisfied as regards this afternoon, in view of the fact that you cannot be here, but I should like to make it quite plain that I propose to take the necessary steps to ask the Committee if possible to sit at four or at some other hour in the afternoon, when we next meet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MAGNAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would beg the promoter of the Bill to do nothing of the kind—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1933-1934V000P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. WILLIAMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. There is no Motion before the Committee. May I move, "That the Committee do now adjourn," in order that our discussion may be in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MAGNAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all-my-eye-and Betty-Martin. I quite agree that the promoter has done very gallantly, and we appreciate what he has done, but, looking at the representation on this Committee, as shown by the voting to-day, it would be quite easy for the promoter of the Bill, knowing that he can dragoon his supporters and has got his majority in his pocket, to carry out his purpose. It comes with an ill grace from him, however, that he should com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
mandeer the minority, who cannot possibly get here in the afternoon as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will understand that this merely began as a short discussion on procedure, and we cannot have a long discussion without some formal Motion. I do not think it is desirable that such a Motion should be put forward now. The matter does not arise now, but it may arise the next time we meet. I take it, therefore, that it will be the desire of the Committee to adjourn now until Tuesday next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Committee adjourned at One o'Clock until Tuesday next, 13th March, at Eleven a.m.</p>
