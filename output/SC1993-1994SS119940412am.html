	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I hear a sigh from Conservative Members, but this is a genuine point of order. I seek your guidance. On Tuesday 29 March in our previous sitting, amendments Nos. 270 and 276, tabled by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), appeared on the selection list. They related to the composition of the super-quangos. Today, the amendments have mysteriously disappeared from the selection list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also seek your advice, Mr. Martin, on a related matter because on 29 March the amendments appeared on the amendment paper but do not appear on today's amendment paper; they have disappeared. It appears that yesterday—his remarks are quoted in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 12 April—the hon. Member for Angus, East said that if Labour's amendments were not supported this morning, he expected to be voting on his own amendments. The hon. Gentleman is willing to support two amendments that do not exist on the amendment paper, which is a problem for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could you clarify what is happening, Mr. Martin, because the people of Scotland are being misled by the irresponsible behaviour of the hon. Member for Angus, East and his party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely up to hon. Members to choose whether to withdraw amendments before they are due to be debated by the Committee. If the amendments do not appear on the selection list, it is because they have been withdrawn. The hon. Member for Angus, East is entitled to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to help the poor lost soul, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) who seems to be thoroughly confused. He thinks that people have been misled by irresponsible behaviour, but he is displaying such behaviour himself. The hon. Gentleman said that the amendments have mysteriously disappeared. There is no mystery. They were withdrawn because they were consequential to a package of measures that was predicated on a regional system of water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central seems to be thoroughly confused. The amendments have been replaced by others which appear on the amendment paper and will be debated today. The Labour party does not know whether it is coming or going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 652, in page 129, line 8, leave out "who appear to him" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"recommended to him by the appropriate local authorities as persons who appear to them".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 416, in page 129, line 10, after "authority", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"including at least one person with knowledge and experience of consumer issues.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 682, in page 129, leave out from beginning of line 12 to "no" in line 14 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"4. A person appointed under paragraph 3 above shall have.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 683, in page 129, leave out lines 16 and 17.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a significant day in the Committee's proeedings because the subject that we are debating is fundamental. Behind the amendment is the guts of what the Government are attempting in terms of their water plans and our alternative to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous sitting, the Government voted down the amendment that would have provided for 12 water authorities in Scotland and imposed three super-quangos. Today we are considering whether the quangos should consist of locally elected representatives of the people or the appointed representatives of the Secretary of State. We are discussing an issue of principle. The new water
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1647</span>
authorities will handle the delivery of water and sewerage services. Should that task be handled by people who are appointed by the Secretary of State on a whim, who may come from any background, with or without political credentials, or should we continue the 150-year-old tradition of water authorities that consist entirely of locally elected councillors? Our amendments would provide for the latter and ensure that locally elected representatives would make the decisions and be accountable for delivering services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want councillors to have a direct input to the new water authorities, but why should the members be appointed by the Secretary of State and not by councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should read our amendments. Amendment No. 676 would remove the provision that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. People nominated by local authorities should be appointed to the new water authorities. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman twitters on, as he always does. The amendments would not provide powers for the Secretary of State to select members. They would enable locally elected councillors to serve on the water authorities, thus representing their authorities and the wider public interest. Until last week, the hon. Gentleman was willing to allow the Secretary of State to appoint almost two thirds of the members of the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks about reading the amendment. I have consistently said that councils should appoint members. He has not answered the point about the Secretary of State appointing councillors. I hope that the Secretary of State will appoint councillors, but my amendment, which appears on today's selection list, would give the power to appoint to councils. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that his amendment appears on today's selection list. He criticised me a month ago for being a month late with my amendments, and last week for being three lines early. That was his catchy description. The hon. Gentleman's amendments are a month early but miles too late. He tabled amendments that would have given the Government power to appoint up to two thirds of the members of the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Member for Angus, East has rehashed an old idea, which formed the content of the "Dear Margaret" letter during the Maastricht debate. That letter was about making deals and getting certain place people on to committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is little doubt that a party that was willing to enter the Government Lobby last year to oppose an amendment that would have ensured that the European Committee of the Regions was composed of local councillors, has no grounds to claim that other committees should consist of councillors. The stain of last year's vote will linger. The betrayal is imprinted on the Scottish National party, which voted against a Labour amendment that sought to ensure that the European Committee of the Regions was made up of local
	<span class='label label-info column'>1648</span>
councillors. People will judge the SNP's words about water in the light of its actions last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering an important principle. Before I consider it in detail, I wish to talk about the other big issue that has arisen from the water debate. During our previous sitting, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) claimed, with apparent angst, that we were misrepresenting the Government's privatisation intentions. He asked the Committee to take his word that the Government would not privatise water and, therefore, that debate which was predicated on the Government's desire to privatise water in Scotland was bogus and that the 1.2 million people who voted in the Strathclyde referendum had been misled by Opposition Members. Before we finally decide on the composition of the water authorities, it is important to explore that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot make it much plainer than that. We are not privatising water."</p></blockquote>
I do not know why he did not go on to say, "Read my lips" and say it again, but he reiterated the point time after time. I repeat his words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot make it much plainer than that. We are not privatising water."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 March 1994; 
	<i>c.</i> 1536.]</p></blockquote>
The Government should try to work out why people in Scotland still believe that they have every intention of privatising water. That underlies their philosphy. For verification, the words of the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) in 
	<i>Hansard</i> should be examined. Occasionally the hon. Gentleman discovers a nasty untruth and blurts it out. As we have experienced in the Committee, occasionally he tells the uncomfortable truth. He said on 29 March:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State has recognised public opinion. Consultation was carried out and privatisation, even though it may have been the Government's preferred option, has been thrown out of the window."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 March 1994; 
	<i>c.</i> 1553.]</p></blockquote>
Those words of the sometimes over-frank Conservative Back Bencher should be remembered. Privatisation was the Government's preferred option and the hon. Gentleman tells us that it has been thrown out of the window. People in Scotland should note that it was the preferred option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not put words into the Government's mouth. The Government never had a preferred option. They put forward eight options of equal validity, but none was preferred to the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anybody who looks at the Government's consultative document can read between the lines and make a judgment about the space that was allocated to the privatisation option. The hon. Member for Ayr came to that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 
	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait until I have answered the Minister. The hon. Member for Ayr came to that conclusion. I make the point that he believed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1649</span>
that that was the Government's preferred option and, of course, he was right. After all, that is what the Government did in England and Wales. We are not stretching credulity by suggesting that they intend to privatise water in Scotland because, with absolute conviction and enthusiasm, they actually did that south of the border. They have not resiled from their actions, despite the misery that has been created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I made that statement and I stick by it entirely. That may have been the Government's preference, but I am not in the inner sanctums of Government. It is a matter of conjecture whether privatisation was or was not the preferred option. Looking at the scenario in England, I should think that it would have been considered. I see no reason to retract or feel aggrieved by the words that are reported in 
	<i>Hansard.</i> I stick by them 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never thought that the hon. Gentleman would feel aggrieved. The words are on record. The hon. Gentleman believes them and we know why, because we believe them as well. It is common sense. The hon. Gentleman came to the only possible conclusion: that the Government intended to go down the same route as they have gone down in England and Wales. The thrust of and the line space in the Government's consultative document suggested that that would be their preferred option and people in Scotland believe that it is still on the agenda. Why should they not? The Minister tells us that water will not be privatised, but have we not heard such promises before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are considering membership of committees. The argument about privatisation of water has already been put—and led—by the hon. Member for Hamilton. The amendments concern the make-up of committees and statutory bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but it is an important part of my case that, by agreeing to the Opposition amendments and accepting the principle that locally-elected councillors should be members of the authorities, the Government would go some way towards giving credibility to their assurances about privatisation. It is pivotal to my case to establish that the public have good grounds for suspecting that the Government will take the privatisation route and that reassurance is required. The Government's agreement to the amendments in the group led by No. 676 would provide genuine reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend the hon. Gentleman to the perusal of legislation for Scotland since 1979, for an appreciation of why I am so frustrated. We have not pursued in Scotland the policies that have been carried out in England and Wales, particularly on such matters as privatisation. We have been slow to respond to that issue. Therefore the case made by the hon. Member for Hamilton is nonsense. If it were not, I should not be so frustrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help but be sympathetic towards the frustration of the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). I am sure that it must worry us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1650</span>
However, if he seeks consolation about the Government's longer-term ambitions, he should consider more carefully what the Government have said and done—particularly in respect of their record of promises. Two years ago the Government stated that they would not extend VAT and that they were the party of low taxation. We now know how truthful they were. If they lied two years ago they can lie now about water. I am accusing the Government of deceit in their 1992 general election promises. This country's electors now know that the Government cannot be trusted on the matter of taxation. Why should the public trust their promises about water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. In view of the hon. Gentleman's citation of my firm assurance about privatisation I believe that he is accusing me of lying. I think that he should be asked to withdraw that accusation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given a ruling before on this matter. I would not allow any hon. Member to say that another member of the Committee was lying. If the hon. Member for Hamilton was referring to a political organisation I have no power in the matter, which is for his judgment. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not accuse the Minister or any other member of the Committee of lying. I would not allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Martin. I have said time and again that the Government's categorical assurances cannot be trusted. Their statements about VAT and about general taxation levels could not have been more categorical. People throughout the country know that they have been betrayed. The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Dumfries, is an honourable man, for whom there is immense affection throughout Scotland. However, what he tells us on behalf of the Government must be treated as a statement by them. If their promises on taxation cannot be trusted, their assurances about water will not and cannot be trusted. That is the message that we shall be putting across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To back the hon. Gentleman's case, I remind the Committee that in 1984 a Minister gave an absolute assurance that there was no intention of privatisation in England when the boards were created. Two years later another Minister said that the boards were perfectly fit for privatisation. If the Government did that then, why should we trust them now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that we cannot trust the Conservatives, and people in Scotland do not trust them. In the Strathclyde referendum, the four to one majorities in the Conservative seats were so significantly high because people believe that in the next stage of the Government's programme, they will do in Scotland what they did in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants to be taken seriously and build up the trust that has been so sorely betrayed, and if he wants his assurances about water to be accepted throughout Scotland, one way of doing that would be to consider accepting our amendments. The Government will be creating three super-quangos and stuffing them with their Conservative party cronies and pals, as they have done with so many other organisations in Scotland. Doing so will simply fuel the suspicion that they will again betray the promises that they made in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>1651</span>
When we try to discover from the composition of the quangos what the Government intend to do, an interesting picture develops. The most authoritative picture is not from the Secretary of State for Scotland who is at this very moment speaking at a press conference in Edinburgh—and perhaps giving the press more information than the Committee will receive—but from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are proposing to set up three water authorities in Scotland, which will be relatively small and effective boards of seven to 11 members plus the chief executive, all appointed, of course, by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members said "of course", underlining the Minister's words. The hon. Gentleman continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If I did not say so. Opposition Members would be up to their feet asking why not.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The authorities will be democratically accountable to Parliament. Men and women of a blend of expertise, with knowledge of the water industry and of business, will be members of the boards." [

	<i>c.</i> 1538.]</p></blockquote>
That is the way in which the Minister described what we are debating. However, this week's 
	<i>Sunday Mail</i> disclosed that the Government have already chosen one of the members of one of the boards. It is not a locally elected councillor, or even a Conservative councillor with a background in the water and sewerage industry, but a leading business man. This, of course, comes as a huge surprise to Scots and to Opposition Members. According to the 
	<i>Sunday Mail,</i> Brian Fitzgerald, managing director of John Laing (Scotland) will be the top man. He is tipped to be one of the chairmen of the three super-quangos which will run Scotland's water industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not know whether Mr. Brian Fitzgerald responded to the Secretary of State's peddling of the Conservative party in advertisements that appeared a few weeks ago. The great office of Secretary of State for Scotland was used in an advertising campaign as a desperate plea for people in Scotland to stand as Conservative candidates in the local elections.

Brian Fitzgerald will appear on a ballot paper as one of the Conservative party's kamikaze candidates. If so, his purpose will be simply to prove his credentials to the chairman of one of the three authorities. Interestingly, when the 
	<i>Sunday Mail</i> telephoned Mr. Fitzgerald about the story, he was quoted as saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"he did not want to comment as he was 'a bit sensitive about it.' "</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether his sensitivity has to do with his potential candidacy or with the fact that he has been promised the job already. Will the Minister say whether Mr. Brian Fitzgerald is to be one of the members of the authorities? Has he been approached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is quite revealing, given that the Secretary of State, who is not a member of this Committee, is at present giving a press conference in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us continue with the saga from the hon. Member for Dumfries about what will happen. What are the Government proposing? Information about that is noticeably thin. The Minister told the Committee on 29 March:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have explained several times that the proposed public water authorities will be responsible to the Secretary of State and, therefore, democratically accountable to the country. They will be made up of extremely able people such as local authority members, engineers and business men." [
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 March 1994; 
	<i>c.</i> 1545.]</p></blockquote>
We should not use the term "business men". That means that Mrs. Anne Gloag, who—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "business men" includes business women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the term includes business women, and Conservative Members of course agree with him. That shows the Government's carelessness about language and the dismissiveness with which they treat people. No wonder people distrust the Government, whatever they say. The Government say "men", but mean "women". Presumably, when they say "women" they mean "men", and when they say that they will not privatise water, they mean that they will privatise it eventually. That is the route they are taking us down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on to claim that the conglomeration of people described generically by him will run the water authorities in Scotland "extremely effectively". The assumption is that the Government's appointees will run all the organisations effectively. I presume that that means that the organisations will be run in the same way as those that were singled out for specific criticism in the recent report from the Tory-dominated, all-party Public Accounts Committee. The assumption that the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1653</span>
of State for Scotland will be able to pick the right people is yet another example of the Government's arrogance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government stated the criteria for appointments to the new bodies, and then went on to try to prove that the process is democratic, and that it will lead to a democratic accountability that is similar to, if not better than, the system that has existed through 150 years of municipal control of water and sewerage. On 29 March, my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central asked the Minister how those bodies can be democratic, to which the Minister, with the brevity for which he is becoming legendary, replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because they will be democratically responsible to the Secretary of State in Parliament."</p></blockquote>
He spoke as if that answered the key question about democratic accountability, especially in the local context, which has been the basis of the control of water and sewerage over the years. The Minister went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have been carefully explaining how the water authorities will be responsible to the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament, and all hon. Members have access to the Secretary of State."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 29 March 1994; 
	<i>c.</i> 1541.]</p></blockquote>
At present, water authorities are accountable because they are made up of locally elected councillors, who can be removed. They represent localities, including the Minister's constituency, which is represented by councillors who are on the water authority for that part of the world. Those people will be replaced by a maximum of 33 people who will be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. They cannot be removed by the people. Once a month at Scottish Question Time, the Secretary of State will be responsible for the whole water industry in the same way as he is responsible for the whole machinery of government in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that anyone in Scotland, even in the Conservative party, thinks that that is right, appropriate or adequate as a method for running water and sewerage. If Conservative Members think that that is the partisan view of Labour Members, they should go to Tory-controlled Stirling district council and ask about its unanimous policy on water. Conservative-controlled Stirling district council's policy is that water authorities should be made up of councillors nominated by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers and Conservative Members should visit Edinburgh district council and ask its Conservative group about its policy on who should serve on the water authorities. They will find that the Conservative group believes that water authorities should be made up of locally elected councillors nominated by local authorities. That is the basis of our case. It is not based on our dogma, but on the common sense view of people throughout Scotland, including the leaders of Conservative councils, who believe that the Government have got the policy wrong. Some think that it is spectacularly and arrogantly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Water is different. Conservative councillors do not hold such opinions out of sentimentality for the past. Water is important not only because of its quality and the effectiveness of the sewerage systems, but because in the years of municipal control people have believed in the accountability, closeness and transparency of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1654</span>
decision-making process and in the ability to remove those who make decisions about water. That is crucial. It is why water is different from practically every other local authority or public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are right to ask Labour Members what we would do if the Government resist our amendments. What will happen if the Bill reaches the statute book and three super-quangos are created to look after Scotland's water? All the appointments to them will be made by the Secretary of State for Scotland and he may include a few nominal councillors appointed at his whim. What will the Labour party do about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell the Committee precisely what the Labour party and I, as the Secretary of State for Scotland after Labour wins the next election, will do. When I get into St. Andrew's house, I will write to all of those appointed to the new water authorities to ask for their resignations. In the interests of the common sense running of the water industry, it will be right to ask those who are appointed without any consensus in Scotland and against the grain of public opinion to tender their resignations to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some may ask under what authority I, as Secretary of State for Scotland, will be able to act in such a way. First, I shall have the democratic credentials to do so. Secondly, when asked, I will point to the case of Mr. Bill Fyfe and the Greater Glasgow health board. The Secretary of State for Scotland had no power to sack Mr. Bill Fyfe, but the Secretary of State telephoned him to ask him to resign. Therefore, I shall ask all those appointed to the three water authorities to resign. I shall then ask the local authorities in the three water authorities area to nominate people for posts with the three authorities, and appoint the nominees to the boards pending the review of local government that a Labour Government will undertake immediately following the election which will be reported to the Scottish Parliament. The future ex-Member for Aberdeen, South may laugh. I make a firm commitment that anyone who takes up an appointment—Mr. Brian Fitzgerald or anyone else—will have to accept that from 1996 onwards—if the Bill reaches the statute book—they will be in their posts only as long as there is a Conservative Government. We intend to return control of the Scottish water industry to locally elected councillors from whom it should never have been removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made an important watershed point of considerable relevance to the debate. The Government have proved nothing in the way of the authorities effectiveness being improved by their own nominees and place men members of them. The Government have no case for changing a tradition of 150 years of municipal control of the fundamental public source and supply of water, and provision of sewerage services. They have betrayed Scottish public opinion, which has told them, resolutely and across party boundaries, that what they are doing is wrong. They should now recognise that if they continue to move against the grain of public opinion, not only will the Scottish people take their revenge in the coming two sets of elections this year, but that revenge will linger on and become a major reason for their defeat when they run out of time, or have the guts to go, and face the electorate at a general election. We shall do what the Scottish people want: return water and sewerage responsibilities to those who are trusted and elected by the people, and can be removed by them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will add briefly to the case made by the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). I agree that the provision is an important part of the Government's new proposals for establishing water authorities. It goes without saying that the Committee should, as a matter of urgency, turn its attention to the lack of legitimacy, from an electoral and democratic viewpoint, that is the inherent flaw in the Government's proposed scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 652, 416 and 657 were intended as probing amendments. When the Minister replies, I hope that he will be able to give me a good reason if he does not accept them. Amendment No. 416 relates to consumer experience being a part of membership of the proposed boards: amendment No. 657 relates to conflicts of interest and a publicly available register to set out those conflicts not being set up. The amendments are subsidiary to the strategic question of principle raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee wishes to know the detail of what the Government have in mind for selecting members of the new water authorities. If the Government proceed down the route of creating three super-quangos—an accurate way of describing the three new water authorities—the machinery of government in Scotland as we have known it will be affected significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special provisions for public bodies appointed by the Secretary of State were always considered incidental to the thrust of the democratic machinery that we have been accustomed to north of the border. By introducing schedule 7, the Government have, at a stroke, shifted the balance irrevocably. Appointments by the Secretary of State to public authorities—quangos—will become an integral and substantial method of governing and decision making on the public's behalf north of the border. If that is to be the way of things, existing provisions for controlling quangos must be thoroughly examined, revised and revisited to bring about sensible control of the running of the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hamilton—I hope against hope that they will—then they owe the Committee a detailed exposition of how they intend to lay down the Secretary of State's duties for appointing members of the new water authorities. They must have some ideas about rules and guidelines for the machinery that will create the new bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent upon the Minister to say a little more about how the Government will begin the process. Past methods have been haphazard, secretive and unsatisfactory, but were perhaps accepted because that was a marginal element of the conduct of Scottish public life. If schedule 7 is passed and goes through its remaining legislative stages, the balance will shift towards quangos. I find that unacceptable, but, if there are to be quangos, far more transparent and substantial rules and regulations for governing them must be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for my concern—this is by no means an exhaustive list of the problems ahead, but simply an example—is that the balance of the relationship between advisers and civil servants, and the membership of the boards, will change fundamentally. The Government appear to imply, by their introduction of this plan, that they are looking for people who will take their own executive decisions. That is not to say, of course, that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>1656</span>
will not have ministerial back-up and advisers. However, the current Chinese wall between serving members of water authorities and the high-quality professional advice given to them through the system of local government that has been built up over many years will change radically. If the Government appoint people with experience and executive authority, these appointees will be inclined to make decisions on the basis of their experience and advice. That will fundamentally change the kind of officers and staff who will wish to serve water authorities. It will confuse hopelessly the relationship between them and the officials who serve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some questions the answers to which may be obvious to some, but not to me. They relate to the legal status of the new authorities under schedule 7. Paragraph 2 relates to the position of the new authorities. It states that a new water and sewerage authority shall not
	<br><blockquote><p>"be regarded as a servant or agent of the Crown; have any status, immunity or privilege of the Crown; be exempt from"</p></blockquote>
any taxation provisions. That opens up the question what powers the members of the new water authorities will have, especially in connection with any debts that the authorities might run up and with the intromission with heritable property—our public assets. The bodies corporate that will be set up will not hold those heritable subjects or properties on behalf of the Crown. That seems to give the members of the new water authorities carte blanche to intromit with those heritable assets without let or hindrance from the Secretary of State. Also, the schedule appears to give the members of the new bodies the freedom to run up debts without cover from the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear more about the powers to be given to the new authorities, and about the control available to the Secretary of State if matters go disastrously wrong in the stewardship of the heritable assets, if substantial debts are run up, or if borrowing is undertaken that is inimical to the long-term public interest. What powers will the Secretary of State have to rein in such activities if he considers there to be a public reason so to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is entitled to hear in detail the Government's criteria for deciding which people will be the members of the boards. I do not understand why there should not be local authority representatives. The inclusion of such people would be a neat, cost-free solution. It would preserve all that is best in the way in which the water industry has been run north of the border. I foresee all sorts of problems with the proposals. The hon. Member for Hamilton has rehearsed at length the democratic arguments against them. I concur with him, but many logistical and other administrative problems will flow from the Government's plans unless the amendments are accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton stated what he will do when he is Secretary of State for Scotland. That was an important statement. People who are willing to take decisions with consequences for their personal futures, and any organisations that may enter into financial arrangements with the new water authorities, should understand that the Government's proposals will not survive a change of Government. The hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1657</span>
Hamilton was right to make that clear. Let there be no doubt: if I am the Secretary of State for Scotland after the next general election, I shall take exactly the same view. I may even go further than the hon. Gentleman. It would not be impossible legislatively to disinter the three water authorities and make them joint boards, or joint committees, of local authorities. It would not take long to do that, and I understand that the general statement by the hon. Member for Hamilton embraced such action. The hon. Gentleman may be right to say that he would only have to wait overnight, after collecting his seals of office from the palace, before signing the letters and re-establishing the membership. That may be the quickest way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However it is done—whatever legislative process is used and whatever executive authority any new Secretary of State will have after the next general election—people should be in no doubt that the schedule and the associated clauses will be the first casualties of any change of Government. That should be made crystal clear so that people cannot say in the sorrow of hindsight that they did not know what to expect. Anyone who takes action associated with schedule 7 or membership of the new committees should know what to expect if the next general election brings, as I anticipate that it will, a combination of new political forces in the governance of Scotland and the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely reject the arguments of Opposition Members. I recognise the importance of the Government's intentions to bring into the relevant spheres of service provision levels of expertise and interests that are currently not open to them. Many people with much to give to society cannot give the time and effort that are required for service on a local authority. Local authorities provide a range of services and deal with a range of interests. Individuals who become involved at local authority level must have time and must be able to apply themselves across the board. The option that is proposed allows those who have much to offer an opportunity to become involved and to do something for other members of society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that he is painting a false picture of the role of a local authority councillor? Local authority councillors in any organisation work along with the officials. With officials beside them there is expertise and knowledge. Councillors do not just state their own prejudices, they base their views on the best advice of their officials. That is the process that takes place when local authority councillors come together in any joint arrangement. The arrangements are not as the hon. Gentleman has painted them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not picked up what I said, which was that many people today have much to give to society at large. Many of those people cannot participate as much as they would like in local government work, because of business commitments and other interests. Of course, people have livings to make. The hon. Gentleman seems not to understand that. People have duties to their families and to employers which debar them from involvement in local authorities. The proposal that we are discussing would allow such people an opportunity to participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1658</span>
I have some sympathy with Opposition Members in that I recognise that local authority councillors have contact with the public at large and in many ways have their ears to the ground. On that basis, I consider some involvement by local authority representatives in the boards to be important. The options in the Bill are absolutely right, but I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to provide some assurance that local authority representatives could have a part to play in the make-up of the boards in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ayr sees quangos as some form of public service, albeit with a salary and pension rights thrown in. I rather take the view of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that the quangos are an integral and substantial part of the Government's chosen way of running Scotland. It almost appears that they are the main way in which the Government want to run Scotland, in preference to duly elected local authorities. I find that approach unacceptable. I hope that the words that we have heard in opposition to the water authorities will prove to be a requiem for unwanted quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak to my amendments, but I should mention that all the amendments in the group are attempts to make the best of a bad job. Ideally, the Government would take the hint—or rather the strong, loud and clear message from Scotland—and dump this unwanted, ill-thought-out legislation into the dustbin where it belongs. Unfortunately, that will not happen. It will not happen at the end of the debate by a vote, yet again, of 12:11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having created the three giant non-elected boards, the Government must then staff them. They propose to do that by the Secretary of State tapping on the shoulders of a few people, chosen by him for his own purposes. Previous examples of central Government manipulation of health boards and other quangos do not bode well for the future of water services in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The water boards will consist of between seven and 11 Secretary of State appointees, along with a chief executive, also appointed by the Secretary of State. There we have the real Mr. H
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->O. The chief executive will have full status as a board member, which must mean full voting rights. Therefore, full status will be given to someone who is presumably an expert and a full-time professional, in direct charge of the full-time professional water board staff. Anyone who knows anything about such organisations will know where the power of information, expertise and knowledge will actually rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are creating their own water supremo, with a supporting cast of seven to 11 extras and absolutely no audience participation. If they ever get round to privatisation, guess who would be in an ideal position to run and control such a private company? Perhaps our fears are unfounded, but previous examples from England and Wales would tend to support my pessimistic view of the Government's attitude and proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that will happen behind closed doors. Water authority personnel will be accountable to no one, least of all to the people of Scotland who will pay their salaries and who did not want the boards in the first place. The proposed system for water services is light years away from the present democratically elected and accountable local government system which people actually want. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1659</span>
Government's proposed system is total centralisation of power into Government hands, specifically into the hands of the Secretary of State who will appoint the chairman and deputy chairman. He may even remove board members and will determine pay, allowances and pensions in what looks to be a nice little earner for the Secretary of State's chosen few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain exactly what the Government have in mind? Will the chosen board members be full time or part time? What sort of pay and pension provision will they receive? The public will pay for that, so they have a right to know what the Government have in mind. They must have something in mind. They have not made their decisions in a vacuum. The Secretary of State will appoint the first chief executive—the first Mr. H
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub -->O—and will approve the terms and conditions of future chief executives. The bodies will reflect the dogma of the Government and of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How often will the boards meet? Why will there not be an automatic public right to attend those meetings? The public have a right to know what the Government have in mind in establishing those bodies. I ask such questions because the system sponsored by the Government is taking over from an open, accountable local government set-up in which elected councillors are publicly responsible for their actions. Other responsibilities are laid upon them. They have codes of conduct and must ultimately face the general public in elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Gentleman is articulating a view that we might accept, I am still having great difficulty in understanding his amendments, the fall-back position that was announced at yesterday's press conference. The hon. Gentleman removed from the amendment paper amendments Nos. 270 and 276 which would have allowed for the appointment of people who were not councillors even though they had been nominated by the local authorities. He has now replaced that proposal with amendment No. 681, and told us that we should recognise the brilliance of the Scottish National party in proposing this great model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has discarded the amendments that were flawed and has got rid of the embarrassment of previously providing the Government with a get-out clause. According to amendment No. 681, the Secretary of State can select
	<br><blockquote><p>"two persons appointed by each local authority within the water authority area from persons who appear to have knowledge or experience relevant to the discharge of the functions of the authority."</p></blockquote>
That means that local authorities could appoint people who were not members of local authorities. Under the hon. Gentleman's master plan, the water authorities' membership need include no local councillors. Will he explain the mystery of the Scottish Nationalists' great fallback position? Under their blueprint, no councillors need be appointed to the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1660</span>
expressed. We are proposing that the local authorities should nominate and create the members of these boards. They can choose councillors if they wish, or they can choose not to appoint councillors. That is the democratic right of elected councillors. Under amendment No. 681, the boards could be made up solely of councillors if that is what the local authorities decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 681 takes account of the decision that was reached at our last sitting. My original amendments were predicated on the fact that this was based on a regional system—it was a package of amendments. When my previous amendment fell by 12 votes to 11—as usually happens, because the hon. Gentleman has not persuaded one Tory Member to vote with the Opposition—I had to alter my proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is quite straightforward. It says that there shall be
	<br><blockquote><p>"two persons appointed by each local authority within the water authority area".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the councils will comprise and choose the members of the area's water authority. The difference in principle between us is that under the hon. Gentleman's proposal, the decision will be taken by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I want to leave the choice with democratically elected councillors. There is no great mystery about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have told the hon. Gentleman that I will support this amendment because, like him, I wish to see councillors serve on the water authorities.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want this to be absolutely clear. It is important that people outside the rarefied atmosphere of this Committee Room realise the chasm that exists between the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and I, which the hon. Gentleman has said that he will support—and I welcome his support—and his proposals. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has also argued that an important principle is involved, and that the elected representatives of the people should make up the membership of the water authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East is saying that although it is not good enough for the Secretary of State—who is, after all, an elected Member of Parliament—to choose who will serve on the local authorities, it is good enough for local councils to choose people who may not be local councillors to serve on them. The Labour party and, I believe, the Liberal Democratic party, believe that the authorities should be made up of councillors. They have the mandate, the authority, the base and the sounding board, and they should be taking the decisions. To allow Tory councils to appoint a gang of business men to the water authorities is not much of an improvement on allowing their boss, the Secretary of State for Scotland, to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the hon. Gentleman's proposal, the Secretary of State could appoint Tory councillors to do the same job. That is not satisfactory. I remind the hon. Gentleman that amendment No. 652 in the name of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0920">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1661</span>
the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire would allow for non-councillors to be appointed equally. It would simply provide that the Secretary of State appoints people recommended to him by the local authorities. The SNP amendment also believes in that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 681, the choice would be up to the local authorities, as it is with outside appointments. They need not necessarily choose councillors; they are democratically elected and they can choose non-councillors for outside appointments if they believe such people to have special expertise. But they are linked to the council, and they are responsible. If the council does not approve of the way in which they act, it will not nominate them in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has read amendment No. 554 which makes it clear that elected councillors will serve on the authorities. What my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton said about what he will do immediately after becoming Secretary of State for Scotland was an interim step. However, amendment No. 554 makes it clear that elected local councillors will serve on the authorities. Is that not sufficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is understood, but, under my amendment, all the members of the authorities could be elected councillors if they so choose. That is their democratic right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to continue and to say something about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hamilton has accepted that the authorities will have between seven and 11 members, which is the Government's proposal. I hope to see the whole scheme scrapped and the water services returned to local councils. The hon. Member for Hamilton should keep that in mind, but he is creating a slight difficulty by accepting the Government's numbers. I hope that he will consider extending the number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would mean that more than between seven and 11 people would serve. Two people from each local authority would be appointed and, therefore, the authorities would be larger. However, under the proposal of the hon. Member for Hamilton, as enunciated, some councils would not be represented, but would have delegates. We need more members on the new authorities in the short time it will take to get rid of them and to return water services to local authority control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had been listening to my speech, he would realise that my points were predicated on the Bill being accepted in its present form. That is not our ideal. Our ideal was contained in the amendments that were rejected in the previous sitting, but which may return in a different guise on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement of policy that I articulated was predicated on the Bill going through in its present form. What we do after that is a matter for due consideration by, I hope, a Scottish Parliament sitting in Scotland. I explained what I would do on day one as Secretary of State for Scotland in St. Andrew's house. I would return to the democratic credentials. The hon. Gentleman's
	<span class='label label-info column'>1662</span>
amendment would mean that local councillors could be on the water authorities, but we have argued that councillors must be on them and that the authorities must be made up of local councillors only. Such a difference divided us last year in our attitudes to the European Committee of the Regions. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman should find himself in a similar dilemma this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is guilty of that behaviour. I have given him some leeway, but when he interrupts other hon. Members so that their speeches cannot be heard, he must be called to order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to move on to the main event, which is consideration of the Bill. I do not want to be drawn into sideshows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would enable more people to become members of the water authorities and councils would be able to choose them directly. That is a fundamental principle. I make no apology for it and I hope that it attracts the support of hon. Members. However, the Labour party's support tends to be one sided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule vaguely suggests that committees may be established by the water authorities. That is a separate issue from that of local authority members, but it is interlinked. It is not clear whether the committees are to be executive or advisory, but the Bill implies that they will be executive. What do the Government have in mind? What structure, powers and role do they envisage for the committees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have included the committees in the Bill. Therefore, they must have a specific function for them. I hope that the Minister will explain that. Is the provision simply a catch-all clause, which ensures that committees can be formed so that every decision does not have to be taken by the board? I prefer to know the Government's intentions before the Bill becomes law than to find out by diktat afterwards. If the committees consist of between seven to 11 water authority members, their powers are potentially massive, even on a report-back basis. Any subgroup that consists of seven to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1663</span>
11 individuals from the water authorities is a cabal and not a committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal reeks of preferential treatment and rule by the chosen few. The Government should be ashamed: their proposal is the opposite of democracy. It contains no inbuilt public accountability and provides for no openness in decision making. Yet it will decide the future of a daily essential service for every man, woman and child in Scotland. I hope that the Minister will consider the contradictions in Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government trumpeted the fact that the poll tax would give local authorities greater accountability. However, the Bill provides for less public accountability by the boards. The Government claim that they favour less centralisation, but the Bill creates greater centralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is riddled with new powers for the Secretary of State and provisions for secondary legislation. It gives the Government complete control over every aspect of the quangos. It removes accountability and any automatic local government input. The tokenism of appointing a few councillors is not enough. The classic Government preference for rule by experts is often the opposite of democratic control. It makes assumptions about those who are chosen and the wishes of the people. The wishes of the people were made clear in the Strathclyde referendum and in every other opinion survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government argue for expertise. Presumably they will appoint people whom they consider to be the most expert to serve on the quangos. They claim that they support more efficiency and the discipline of the market place, but that detracts from democratic input. Government by experts is not always best, especially when the experts are totally unaccountable to the public whom they are supposed serve. Why should a hand-picked, chosen few determine the future of a daily, essential, monopoly service that the public cannot help using?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where does accountability rest? It is not good enough to claim that it rests with the Secretary of State. One Scottish Question Time every four weeks is hardly adequate, nor is the promise of an improved Grand Committee mechanism. The amendments would provide for elected input. Amendment No. 681 would replace control by the Secretary of State with local government control. I fear that pleas to the Government on behalf of local authorities for accountability will go unheeded. The unwanted measure will be forced through by 12 votes to 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very important principle underlies the difference between the amendments and the Government's proposals. As a matter of principle, should Scotland's water industry be controlled by the Secretary of State's unelected appointees or by elected councillors from local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the hon. Member for Angus, East, with genuine respect, that arguing about that principle is important and not a sideshow. It is a question of whether elected people or appointees should be running the water boards. Whether appointees come from the Secretary of State or from the local authorities, they are nevertheless appointees and are not accountable at the ballot box to the consumers in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1664</span>
At the moment, the water industry in Scotland is under democratic control. The people of any area can do something about those who run the water industry: vote for or against them in elections which are held regularly. That cannot be done for appointees. They do not have to stand for re-election, particularly if they are not councillors. They are present on the suffrance of someone else who has given them the authority to be present. That is an important principle which the Labour amendment addresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the hon. Member for Angus, East, the Scottish National party and the Liberal party amendments do not address that fundamental principle. We want elected people running the water industry in Scotland and do not want to sacrifice that principle. I hope that the Minister will address that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My area, Dundee, at the moment comes under Tayside regional council, which is the water authority for the area. Under the Government's proposals there will be one North of Scotland water authority consisting of seven or 11 appointees of the Secretary of State for Scotland. None will be elected by or accountable to the people who live in the northern area. That is unacceptable, not only to me and to members of the Labour party because if the Minister visited Tayside and Grampian and Highland regions and spoke to Conservative councillors, he would discover that they also find the Government's proposals unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Secretary of State is making a statement at a press conference this morning in Scotland. No Opposition member of the Committee knows what the statement will be about, but I assume that the Minister has some inkling of what the right hon. Gentleman will say in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be sufficient for the Minister to say that some councillors will be appointed by the Secretary of State to the water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want one or two token councillors appointed to the North of Scotland water authority or the Minister and the Secretary of State telling us that it is in some sense democratic to have those one or two councillors sitting with so many business people, so many supporters of the Tory party and so many members of the landed aristocracy in the area. Such people would be appointees who would be able to form a majority and outvote elected councillors on matters such as investment. No one will be happy with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Tories intend to advance such an argument, they must not think that they are off the hook of the Strathclyde referendum. They are not off the hook if their only suggestion is to have a token few elected councillors on the water boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health boards in Scotland used to contain token trade unionists and Labour and Liberal people, but had a comfortable Tory majority which ensured that the Government's policy was railroaded through, no matter what the people of an area wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is discussing detailed amendments, but a matter of principle is at stake. An area's water industry should be controlled by the people, not by anyone else and especially not by an appointee of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1665</span>
I admit that the Labour amendments are second best. It cannot be left to a Scottish Parliament to decide the future of local government services in Scotland because as yet there is not a Scottish Parliament and there is not yet a Labour Government to legislate for such a Parliament. We shall not be happy until there is a Scottish Parliament and a proper review of local government services in which the Scottish people decide how to structure the water industry in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to accept that before the next general election a series of new councils and water boards will be set up in Scotland. We want to see the new councils nominating people to the water boards to ensure that there is at least an element of democratic control. That is very much second best because the new councils and the water boards will have no real democratic authority. They will be set up in defiance of the wishes of the people of Scotland, who should decide the structure of local government in their country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Angus, East suggested that there should be two appointees from each of the councils. That is not the way forward. That suggestion would not be popular in Dundee. A minority Labour administration is in charge of Tayside regional council, so we can be confident that Dundee's water and sewerage needs are a priority for that council, along with the needs of everyone else in the council's area. But a board with two nominees from each of the councils in the northern water board area would mean that Dundee would be outvoted by 12:2 or 14:2, depending on the number of councillors nominated for the Northern area water board. Dundee would become a minority interest of that water board, and of the councillors from other areas serving on it. The same problem would also confront Angus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the best that can be done until the people of Scotland are allowed to decide the matter. The hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1666</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spent 200 hours in this Committee, and I am still staggered by the capacity of the hon. Member for Ayr to get things completely wrong. He never listens to what anyone says. He has gone off at a tangent that has nothing to do with what I said. I said that the first priority of a Labour Government in Westminster would be to legislate for a Scottish Parliament, which would then review the structure of local government in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman should listen to what is being said before intervening with a load of nonsense that only delays progress in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important matters. The proposals are undemocratic. The people of Scotland are saddled with a Government whom they did not elect. The Government are pursuing policies that are deeply unpopular with the vast majority of people in Scotland. The proposals are resented even by Conservative supporters, who do not agree with the policies that are being railroaded through Parliament and forced down the throats of the people of Scotland. When the Secretary of State, away back on 17 November 1992, first made his announcement in the House of Commons about the future of water and sewerage in Scotland, he answered a series of questions from hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) asked the Secretary of State whether he would accept the results of the consultation exercise being carried out by the Government on the future of the water and sewerage services. The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will accept the findings of that general consultation". [
	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 November 1992; Vol. 214, 
	<i>c.</i> 157.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister knows that the general consultation found that 64 per cent. of the 4,834 people who responded said that they wanted water and sewerage to remain under local authority control. The Secretary of State for Scotland told the House on 17 November 1992 that he would accept those findings but the Minister in Committee, and no doubt the Secretary of State in Edinburgh, will say this morning that they do not accept the findings of the consultations that we undertook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters have become worse. Not only will the Government not accept those findings, they have rejected the referendum held in Strathclyde a few weeks ago when more than 1 million people stated that they wanted water and sewerage services to remain with local authorities. Nor do they accept the letter from Lothian regional council congratulating Strathclyde and suggesting that the referendum result there was a general indication of the Scottish people's feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter calls upon the Ministers and Conservative Members to respect what the people of Scotland are telling them and to legislate, to ensure that water and sewerage remain with local authorities. We hear nothing of that from the Minister or his spineless supporters sitting behind him who prefer to shut their ears to the voices from Scotland. They prefer to railroad through their policies with the artificial support off those who are not even particularly interested in what is happening in Committee or in the decisions that will anger their own constituents. Although they may be protected for the next two or three years until forced to call a general election, the local Tory councillors who will have to face the public in a few weeks' time are not. They know what is at stake, and the likely outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that same day in November 1992, my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Donohoe)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1667</span>
asked the Secretary of State for Scotland for his assurance that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the vast majority of people say no, he will respect that response".</p></blockquote>
That was something that the Secretary of State did not do in relation to hospital trusts at the time. The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As with the hospital trust consultation period, I will assess the arguments advanced and reach a decision with my colleagues on the basis of those arguments."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 November, 1992; Vol.214, 
	<i>c.</i>l61.]</p></blockquote>
Let the Committee note that the decision was that they would have nothing to do with democracy. It mattered not how many Scottish people said no, or that they want water to remain under local authority control. The Secretary of State would decide, on the basis of discussion with colleagues, what would happen in any case. It mattered not that his colleagues were outvoted in Scotland in the previous general election, that they won only 11 out of 72 Scottish seats, or that three out of every four people who voted in Scotland voted against the Secretary of State and his colleagues. It matters not that even those who did vote for them think that it does not matter. All that matters to them is that decisions are arrived at by him and his colleagues. Government decisions are all that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) said, the Minister's words will go down in Scottish history: it is so because the Minister says it is so. The Government are telling the Scottish people, "We do not care what you think or even what those who voted for us think. We heed only what we think."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. These arguments have been put to the Committee. The hon. Gentleman is repeating them. We are discussing amendments relating to the make-up of the statutory body. Perhaps he will relate his remarks to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a fair reprimand, Mr. Martin. I got carried away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Scotland are saying that if there is a vote on the amendments, the Government should accept them as an expression of the views of Scottish people. The amendments would put water services in Scotland under the control of elected local authorities, which is what the people of Scotland want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South by the Secretary of State for Scotland on that day in November 1992. He said that if the Secretary of State were to listen to what the people were telling him about the issues, and if we were ever to abandon the process by which the Secretary of State for Scotland and his colleagues do what they like in defiance of the Scottish people, it would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a bad day for parliamentary democracy".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 November 1992; Vol. 214, 
	<i>c.</i> 161.]</p></blockquote>
It would not be a bad day for parliamentary democracy. There are different kinds of parliamentary democracy, in which Administrations are legitimised by having been voted into power. The Secretary of State and his colleagues do not enjoy that status. It is a bad day for everyone in Scotland when we must live under the reign of this parliament democracy, which is supported only by
	<span class='label label-info column'>1668</span>
the Conservative party. Its days are numbered by the approach of the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendments Nos. 676 and 554. The latter encapsulates our proposals to replace the Government's plans. Amendment No. 554 would provide that those serving on the large water boards would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"councillors in local authorities which lie within the geographical area of the water authority."</p></blockquote>
I am disappointed that the Government have not tabled an amendment or even given a sign early in this debate to the effect that they recognise that the Strathclyde referendum told them something significant. I am disappointed that the Minister did not work that out through reading his speeches and other contributions made before the recess, which I am sure he would have enjoyed. He might then have realised that there is a great deal of truth in accusations that the Government are ignoring their own consultation. That is significant. I should have thought that the Minister would take an early opportunity to show that he is now willing to come into line with that consultation and to accept the 64 per cent. of opinion that holds that representatives of local authorities should run any future water boards or other arrangements that the Government want to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the Government that the proposals are to do with running the water authorities better, raising finance better and carrying out the improvements to the water and sewerage system that we all recognise will be required in the next 20 or 30 years. The improvements do not require a move away from the democratic principle. I do not understand why the Government have decided that the election or appointment of council members to the water boards is inappropriate. Councils are democratic, so they carry the support of the people in their areas who will eventually receive the services. As we know, the Government have, in England and Wales, adopted a model by which the consumer, theoretically, pays or does not pay for a service. However, there is no question of representation of the consumer's needs. In a system that is run as a free market the service is run as a local monopoly. There is no way for the consumers to promote their wishes. We shall later discuss the role of the customers council and whether that body will be sufficient. However, for the moment I refer the Minister to the 
	<i>Yorkshire Post.</i> He may find that there are worries among consumers about the regulation procedure and about who is appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present we are dealing with worries about who will be appointed to the water boards. Perhaps the Government are worried about political control of the councils, fearing that mainly Labour members would be appointed if the Secretary of State were to choose nominees from elected representatives as amendment No. 554 would provide. The Government would be entitled to be concerned about that because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, a wipe-out of Conservative councillors in Scotland is likely—apart from those who, like Frank Saunders, or Councillor McNichol in Central region, have decided that, because of the Government's blatant ignorance about the wishes of their constituents, they will stand not as Conservatives, but as Independents. I predict that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0924">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1669</span>
seat held by the Conservatives in Kings Park in Stirling district and Central region will be won not by a Conservative, but by an Independent councillor. I am sure that Frank Saunders will be re-elected to represent the wishes of the people and not the diktat of the Conservative party which, with the intervention of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), the Minister of State, Department of Employment, and his election agent, forced him to be deselected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a wipe out across Scotland. The 41,650 people who told the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) that they did not want the proposals for water quangos might also decide to deselect their councillors if they wear Conservative colours at the elections. That might be significant in showing that what happens at the European elections will also happen at the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A worry for the Government might be that if councillors were elected who were not Conservatives, the boards would become under non-Conservative control. That does not seem to be very bad if the purpose of the process is just to enable the water boards to borrow money, to plan on a large scale and to deliver services, which the Government appear to think cannot be done by the present local authorities or by a combination of joint boards. That logic does not hold water. The Minister could not convince anyone in his original contributions. Unless he has become more erudite over the holidays, I doubt that he will be able to convince us in his reply to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason may be that the Government do not expect the boards to be representative and that their purpose is not to represent consumers. The myth portrayed by the hon. Member for Ayr that the boards are about giving people who wish to be involved in public service but who cannot stand for local authorities because of their business or work commitments some way of participating on behalf of the public is a joke. It does not stand up to scrutiny. None of the quangos or boards in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom at this time has anything to do with representation. That is not their purpose. They exist to do the bidding of the Secretary of State or of the appropriate Secretaries of State in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Ayr to argue that business people and others in employment cannot stand for local authorities because of their work commitments, yet to argue also that councillors should not be paid decent salaries because it is important to attract people who have experience of work, business and the community and so can contribute to conducting local authority business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not pursue that intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to pursue it. I taught children with learning difficulties for many years and I am used to the kind of arguments that I hear from the hon. Member for Ayr.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that this is about jobs for the boys—or the girls because women are often appointed, but only with the correct political credentials. Therefore, the boards are not intended to be representative. They will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1670</span>
filled with the same sort of people who are currently filling other appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument that people with special interests should be appointed because they have more knowledge. The local enterprise companies in Scotland are appointed, but become autonomous and self-perpetuating and, in a bizarre way, appoint their successors. Those people have knowledge of and interest in business. However, I have found in, for example, the Forth Valley Enterprises, a deep anxiety among the business community that special interests are self interests: £1.7 million in grants and training payments has gone to people who sit on the board. Therefore, special interests become self interests which, on many occasions, are a denial of, and not an addition to, the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the worry when we hear rumours and statements about someone from Laing Construction possibly being appointed to the chairmanship of one of the boards. That company clearly has a self interest in building, constructing and leasing the facilities that the water boards will require. That is not to say that building and leasing is bad. If the Minister reads my contribution on financial matters, which I made before the recess, he would see that many authorities, including Grampian, Lothian, Central and Strathclyde, lease many pieces of equipment. I argued that they should be allowed to lease fixtures and buildings that would not simply be taken back at the end of the lease period but would be owned by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Important examples exist of boards that do not represent the public interest but serve only the Secretary of State. I have corresponded with Forth valley health board on many issues, for example, the decision to build a neonatal intensive care unit in Stirling and take one away from Falkirk. Some 85,000 people signed petitions against that proposal. Forth valley health board claimed that is was not there to represent the people of Falkirk and their anxieties about the care of babies, but to carry out the Secretary of State's remit. When the chair of that health board did not do that, he was replaced by Mrs. Ibister, a former Tory councillor in Stirling. People who did not agree with the Secretary of State were removed from the health board. That is deeply worrying. That is why I lean towards the idea of elections for appointments to joint boards, even for the provision of health, in local areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said before the recess that my children had given me a book called "Democracy: The Unfinished Journey". I suggested that is should contain an extra chapter called "The Backward Journey", to include the process that is happening now. I took the trouble of taking my children to sunnier climes in our week off. I managed to read the book in that time. I was interested in the ideas that the book presented. In the ancient Greek idea of democracy, "demos" meant most of the people who could participate in making decisions and "polis" meant the decision making process. That is why I disagree with the SNP's ideas. The idea that anyone should participate in the "polis"—the process of making political decisions—without being chosen by those in the "demos"—the constituents—is fundamentally flawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The book contains writings up to 1993. The only periods of writing and analysis that have anything to do with the process that we are witnessing are the fascist periods in Germany and Spain and the Bolshevik state capitalist period in Russia. We are witnessing a miniature
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1671</span>
rerun of the latter period. New economic policy was destroyed by Stalin, who set up appointed boards—miniature politburos—to run matters in accordance with the decisions of the central politburo in Moscow. We are witnessing such a process in Scotland. People say that it is not like that because we do not have secret police, but the situation is similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone whose face does not fit, and who decides to speak out against the Government when serving on boards, is removed. People understand that. The process is not about democracy; it is about the central state in London using its place people, for example, the Secretary of State for Scotland, to run matters in accordance with London's decisions. I understand why people believe that that is a nationalist question. For me, it is not a nationalist question, but a question of democracy. We are witnessing an anti-democratic process. We oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton pointed out, in a parliamentary democracy, there is only one way to deal with that process: to vote in elections. A tremendous swing against the Conservatives will occur in the May regional elections. In the June elections, the Conservatives may be wiped out in many parts of the country. When we gain power, it is important that the process that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton presented is examined and applauded. Immediate change should occur, and the immediate replacement of those who have nothing to do with the democratic process and are only Government agents, with those nominated by local authorities. At the end of the day, I hope that we shall have to unscramble this massive aberration of a Bill and that we move to the position in which representatives of the people are directly elected to local authorities and then directly to joint boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's arguments about efficiency do not stand up. We can be more efficient if the services remain under local authority control. The expertise of finance officials and those who are expert in the technicalities of water and sewerage will be available to the authorities. Therefore, that is more efficient than the three-board system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have to unscramble the Bill, we should, at least, move to joint boards. People will be elected to them and look after consumers' interests by representing them through local authorities and by carrying with them the expertise of officials. Therefore, if joint boards are established, amendment No. 554 is reasonable. The Government should accept it and acknowledge that experts can be on the boards as co-optees, but that the main body of decision making should come from those who have been democratically elected. The Government are not just messing around with water services; they are fundamentally destroying the democratic process upon which Parliament stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the schedule is another aspect of the relentless erosion of democratic control over services in Scotland. My hon. Friend is right about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier debates, we pointed out that water and sewerage services in Scotland are run extremely
	<span class='label label-info column'>1672</span>
efficiently. By any analysis, people receive good value for money and the improvement to engineering works has been first class. The industry is well run now, but we must deal with its future accountability. It is worth spending a minute or two considering the value of existing accountability. We all have constituency experience of the way in which the system works. In my constituency, five elected members of Lothian regional council have a direct input into decisions taken by the water authority. That works very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my time as Member of Parliament for East Lothian, I can recall numerous problems cropping up with respect to water supplies and in relation to which points have been raised about the management of reservoirs and other parts of the water authority's estate. Like other hon. Members, I have received much correspondence about sewage disposal and the need to improve the quality of that service. The democratic system works: people go to the surgeries of local councillors, who attend the full regional council to express public opinion. That pressure delivers the improvements that people want to achieve in the region and in their local areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us make no mistake about the Bill's impact on the public accountability of the water industry. Lothian regional council is made up of democratically-elected members, almost all of whom live in the areas that they represent. Therefore, they are easily accessible to the electorate. In my constituency, services will be transferred to the new East of Scotland water authority, which will stretch from the English border to the River Tay and to Loch Lomond. That massive area covers 21 parliamentary constituencies, but the new authority to administer the water and sewerage services may be made up of as few as seven appointed members. That amounts to three parliamentary constituencies for each nominated member of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of accountability can there possibly be? The members will not be elected: they will be nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland on all types of pretexts. Even if they are inclined to make themselves available to the people to hear their views, there will not be enough of them. Will nominated members hold surgeries so that people can see them in village and town halls on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings and tell them what they think about the quality of water supply, water charges or anything else? Of course they will not because they will not be accountable to the people. They will be accountable to the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's argument. He has pointed out that there will be areas within the East of Scotland Water Authority which will not be represented on the new water board. Would not that breach the principle of no taxation without representation should the board levy charges on such areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point and I agree with my hon. Friend. It is almost certain that no one from my constituency will sit on the water board, knowing the Government's track record in nominating people to health and other boards in Lothian region. I fear that a high quality, accountable service will degenerate into a poorer quality, higher cost, unaccountable service. That is a matter of concern.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0926">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1673</span>
The amendments provide for a temporary fall-back position. Will the members of the water boards, which will cover massive areas, handle massive public budgets and provide a vital public service, come from the list that happens to be in the Secretary of State's political note book or will they at least be nominated from elected councillors of the areas to be served?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the stop-gap measure proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, but, above all, I welcome his clear statement that the quangocrats will be a temporary phenomenon. A Labour Government would be committed to restoring efficiency and accountability to these vital industries and such people will find that their jackets are hanging on slack nails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quangocrats will be invited to resign and will be replaced, temporarily, by elected councillors nominated by the new Secretary of State for Scotland. I stress the word "temporary" because as soon as there is a Scottish Parliament, there will be a major overhaul of the structure of local government and of the water industry. That is the way forward. I hope that the people who are approached by the Secretary of State for Scotland and who are considering taking part in the new quangos know that they will not be there for long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a predictable debate. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Hamilton is not in the Committee Room because the only thing that was less predictable than anticipated was the rather presumptuous and arrogant start to his speech. He said that as soon as he entered St. Andrew's house as Secretary of State for Scotland—something that many of us do not foresee—he would demand the resignation of the members of the water authorities. He mentioned in particular the chairmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the members? Well, that is even worse. Entering St. Andrew's house and in effect firing on the first day the employees of the water authorities is the most unreasonable and undemocratic approach that could possibly be expected. There would be no power from Parliament so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal broadly with the membership of the new authorities. I shall discuss the points made by Opposition hon. Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr. The theme common to many of the amendments is that there should be a guaranteed role for local councils and councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are variations on the theme. Amendment No. 676 would dispense with provisions as to membership. That would make sense only if the service continued to be delivered by local authorities, a suggestion that the Committee has rejected. Amendment No. 554, tabled by the Labour party, wants all members to be councillors, and amendment No. 564 extends that provision even to membership of authority committees. Amendment No. 681, tabled by the Scottish National party, is scarcely less uncompromising. It would have two members appointed by each local authority within the water authority area. Amendments Nos. 272 to 275, 682 and 683 are consequential on amendment No. 681. The Liberal Democrat proposal is a yet further diluted version. Amendment No. 652 provides for the Secretary of State to appoint members recommended by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1674</span>
I have to say that none of those proposals commends itself. We are creating public water authorities because that is the right structure for the water and sewerage services in the years ahead. Opposition Members tend to forget that sewerage is at least as important as water. In the long run, it will be as expensive. At the moment, we are much further away from reaching acceptable standards in sewerage than we are with water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I spent a happy morning at the East Calder sewerage works last week, I entirely agree with the Minister about the importance of sewage. The process is fascinating, from the point where the turds come in through to the emergence of clean water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked this question before and have not received an answer: if control of the new water authorities is other than through democratically elected representatives, what machinery will ensure that capital programmes for infrastructure for new developments will meet local priorities? I have asked that question before, but with the best will in the world, I cannot find the answer in 
	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather felt that I had given an answer to that question when, at a previous sitting, I described in some detail the structure of the water authorities, the customer councils and the area committees and their direct responsibility to the Secretary of State who has an important role in connection with capital consents. Later amendments will deal with the duties of authorities to consider particular interests. We are very keen to ensure that the voice of rural areas is heard through the chain of command that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister uses some interesting vocabulary, to which we shall return. However, he said that amendment No. 676 makes sense only in the context of existing local authorities and that that matter had already been disposed of. That is not accurate. The juxtaposition of the Committee and Report stages poses a difficulty for hon. Members. Amendment No. 676 would eliminate the section of the Bill dealing with membership. Our intention is that, if that amendment were carried, we would table a new clause on Report to put in place the provisions that I have described and which are based on nominations from individual local authorities. The Minister should not think that, because amendment No. 676 stands on its own, there is no possibility of a consequential amendment later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->

The structure that we propose will bring efficiency and managerial experience, while retaining the services within the public sector and ensuring public accountability, which the consultation exercise showed that the Scottish people wanted. It was very definite that 90 per cent. of respondents did not want privatisation and wanted water and sewerage services to remain in the public sector. That is what we have done. Of course, the hon.

Nothing in the Bill threatens the continued public nature of the water and sewerage services.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to think that the Secretary of State is responsible for water and sewerage services. Of course Parliament is responsible. Opposition Members can raise Adjournment debates on water and sewerage matters. Of course they have the right, as Members of Parliament, to raise such matters with the water authorities.

Councillor John Young, who is of the highest repute, can say what he likes and he has every right to do so.

Considering the huge amount of money that must be spent to raise the water and, more particularly, the sewerage services to an acceptable standard, we believe that the proposed three water authorities will have a far greater opportunity to carry out the improvements that the Government feel are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Secretary of State will choose water authority members from extremely experienced and skilled business men and business women, engineers, water engineers and civil engineers. There are plenty of people in Scotland who are able to serve on the water authorities. They include a very significant number of local councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very significant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, very significant. I want local councillors to be on water authorities, customer councils and area committees. They could be nominated by community councils and by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been helpful. He has made a new statement of policy by saying that there will be a very significant number of councillors involved. Will it be more that 50 per cent? That would be very significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not ruling out a majority or otherwise. It is open to the Secretary of State to appoint the seven to 11, plus the chief executive from any source that he feels is an advantage to the water authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for being helpful. He is not ruling out 50 per cent. or more being councillors. Will he say that it is his wish that more than half should be councillors? If he is not ruling it out, he might sensibly rule it in. The Bill is being discussed in detail. I suspect that it is the wish of the majority of members of the Committee that the figure should be more than 50 per cent. Why does not the Minister take the bull by the horns and give a commitment now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we have to choose a committee of the most able people. I am not ruling in or out the exact number of local councillors, water engineers, structural engineers or others who have expertise that they could bring to a water authority to provide the best possible water and sewerage services for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that helps my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr who feels strongly that there should be a significant number of local councillors on the water authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain how the area committees of the customer councils will ensure that the priorities for the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure will follow the planning priorities of the new local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will be close contact between the water authorities, the customer councils and the area committees, and the local authorities. There should be an exchange of views on a host of matters relevant to providing local authority services. There will be no particular difficulty in ensuring that the water authority, through the two stages beneath, will receive all the information that it requires to come to the right decision. I am sure that there will be much coming and going between the water authorities and the new local authorities, but that is not a major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about finance. Because the point is technical, I hope that he will forgive me if I keep fairly closely to the information that I have been given. Authorities will be in a position to borrow from anybody, including financial institutions, or have money provided by grant from the Secretary of State, but in each case with Treasury consent. That is outlined in clause 80 (1)(a) and 80 (2)(a) and (b). The running up of debts will be controlled by the need for consent from the Secretary of State and the Treasury before agreement to lend will be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of property, the authorities will acquire legal titles to all land relevant to their function and they may dispose of land under the terms of clause 95, subject to their own needs and requirements. Authorities cannot dispose of land in a way inconsistent with the proper carrying out of their function. They must obtain proper commercial prices for land sold, and local authorities cannot dispose of land at less than best price without the Secretary of State's consent. They are fall-back protections, but day-to-day commercial decisions are a matter for the authorities themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is no question of authorities getting out of control with their financial duties. They must receive authority from the Secretary of State for borrowing consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and I shall consider the detail by looking at 
	<i>Hansard.</i> However, I have a further question. When selling heritable assets, will the authorities not have to conform to the price placed on them by the district valuer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would think so. The district valuer is so involved with every local and water authority issue that the price must be acceptable to and approved by him. It is important that the water authorities maintain a high level of financial propriety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said that the authorities will not be allowed to dispose of land other than at a price agreed with the district valuer. However, clause 95(2) states that they shall not dispose of land
	<br><blockquote><p>"for a consideration less than the best that could reasonably be expected to be obtained on the open market."</p></blockquote>
The Bill contains something different from what the Minister said? What is the truth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the removal of any doubt, I shall let the hon. Gentleman know as soon as possible. I would not want him to get such an important issue incorrect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1680</span>
The hon. Member for Angus, East made a number of points, particularly about the structure of the water authorities. I have covered them by repeating information about the water authorities, about the appointment of members to the customer council, which we shall debate later, and about area committees. People with complaints will have adequate opportunity to ensure that they get to the water authority. Of course, the customer council will be able to go straight to the Secretary of State if it does not receive satisfaction from the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Opposition Members do not accept that anything in the Bill is democratic, they are wrong. There is a good chain from grass roots to the water authority and to the Secretary of State, so that problems can be resolved in a proper democratic way. At the end of the day, the Secretary of State will carry the can. Even if the hon. Member for Hamilton were the Secretary of State, he would accept that he would be democratically elected and responsible to the water authorities as long as he kept them in being. He would have to come to Parliament to change that. It is wrong of him to make threats today to those appointed to the water authorities that they would be summarily dismissed if he were to move to St. Andrew's house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the Minister understand our scepticism at his saying that he would like a significant number of councillors to be appointed? We would all like that: we would prefer that councils were still in control. Every councillor appointed by the Secretary of State means, by definition, a business person not appointed; the latter would be closer to the Secretary of State's wishes. Does he mean one in seven, or two in seven? As a guide, can the Minister say how many councillors were appointed to health boards? Will he give us that proof of the pudding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We shall not discuss the subject of health boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered that question three times in response to the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. I did not rule anything in or out relative to the number of councillors who might be appointed to water authorities, customers councils, or area committees. I would welcome some on each authority because they would bring valuable experience and additional contact with the people whom they represent. I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman finds that so difficult to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth reminding the Minister that we are not talking about very many people. There would be three new water and sewerage authorities with between seven and 11 members each. That is only between 21 and 33 people for the whole of Scotland. It would help if the Minister were to indicate the number of elected councillors he thought should be members of the authorities. That is a crucial issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I will not give a definitive number. The water authorities, each with between seven and 11 people—and I suspect that it will be the higher number—will be chosen from people in Scotland with great expertise in water and sewerage as well as business acumen and experience of water authorities. I have no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1681</span>
doubt that we shall find people of the calibre we require. It is wrong to insinuate, as the hon. Gentleman has, that there are no people in Scotland capable of running the country's water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point to be brought home to Opposition Members is that they seem to forget that there are very many highly skilled and competent water and sewerage engineers running those services in Scotland. It is very likely that they will be running the new authorities, bringing their skill and expertise to this important subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly referred to all those skilled water and sewerage engineers who have devoted their lives to the industry. However, how many did he consult about these changes, and what did they say? Those to whom I have talked see no purpose in the changes, other than privatisation. There can be no other reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, dear. It really is disappointing that the hon. Gentleman refuses to listen to what I have said about privatisation. I say with absolute authority that this is not a privatisation measure. That is not the Government's intention. I cannot make it plainer than that. If hon. Members do not wish to listen, as obviously they do not, they must make their own decisions. What is quite wrong is that, for the past six months, Opposition Members have tramped across Scotland telling everyone that water is to be privatised. That raises emotions because Scottish people are very concerned about their water supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to matters raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. What I said was correct: the district valuer would usually advise the water authority of the best price, and if it wanted to sell below what was advised, it would have to approach the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, that can be discussed in detail when we reach clause 95.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have covered the amendments in some detail. I advise my hon. Friends to reject them and I have given a reasonable explanation of why they should do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know that, from time to time, policy is made on the hoof, but until the past quarter of an hour I had not realised what, exactly, the role of the customers councils was to be. They now assume a greater importance than they appeared to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The customers councils will be discussed when we deal with the next group of amendments. I hope that that will be of help to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we come to the next group of amendments, I hope that the Minister will, after the remarks that he has made, explain the financing of the secretariat of the customers councils and the relationship with existing councils. We await that explanation with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Under-Secretary of State has explained to the Committee why the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1682</span>
amendments should be rejected. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton will not withdraw the amendment, but will press it to a vote, and that the Minister will give the amendments further thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that many technical experts in water and drainage should be board members seems to me to be a total misunderstanding of the purpose of the water and sewerage boards. Their chief executives and senior technical officers will know everything about water and sewerage. People who are responsible to the people and accountable to the electorate are needed on the boards. That is why we need councillors. We are not arguing for their inclusion just for the sake of it. Councillor John Young put the argument well in the article in 
	<i>Scotland on Sunday.</i> He said that the Government treat councillors as nitwits. That is unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State said that he had had meetings with one district council, but when pressed he admitted that the regional council, the authority responsible for water and drainage in Dumfries and Galloway, is pleading with him to keep those services under democratic, elected control. He is paying no attention to that authority. He may meet and talk, but he does not listen to suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only local councillors who are concerned. Even Sir Michael Hirst, never known for his sensitivity to and understanding of local opinion, says that the Government should pay more attention to what people in Scotland think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report in the 
	<i>Sunday Times</i> stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Scottish Office ministers had dismissed the 97 per cent. vote against the government's proposals as 'meaningless', but the party chairman underlined the views of leading members of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, who believe the opposition of 1.2m people should not have been rejected so bluntly."</p></blockquote>
That opinion comes from senior members of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association. We heard before about Councillor Ian Hutchinson, about John Young, about Dumfries and Galloway, where there is a significant number of Conservatives, and about Sir Michael Hirst. They are all telling the Government, "We want democratically-elected people to run the water authorities." Once again, the Government say no. Why? Because they tell us so: because they know better. That is the only argument that we have heard from the Under-Secretary of State and it is not convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last few minutes before lunch, I want to say that although the Minister has allowed us some progress this morning, there has been no substantial progress in the argument. Nothing that we have heard can make any more acceptable the Government's unwillingness to consider the views of the Scottish people as expressed in opinion polls in the Strathclyde referendum and, as the Minister has mentioned, the views of district councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
