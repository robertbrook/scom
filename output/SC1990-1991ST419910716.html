	<div class='legislation'>Draft Forth Ports Authority (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. Neither of the orders have been signed. They have been laid before the Committee unsigned, which is unprecedented. I have never known a statutory instrument or an order to be laid before a Committee unsigned. The reference to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office does not mean a thing. As the orders are unsigned, they are in my view invalid. The Committee should therefore be adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will notice that these are draft orders that have passed through the authority of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. The orders are to be implemented the day after they are laid and they are being laid today, unsigned. According to the texts, they are to be implemented from tomorrow, and so they are invalid. This is yet another sign of the slipshod approach to Scottish business by Scottish Office Ministers. It is time that they were set an example. I am asking you, Mr. Lofthouse, not to create a precedent by allowing the Committee to discuss unsigned orders. I appeal to you to suspend the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point but the drafts are in order and have passed through the House. It is not unprecedented for such drafts to come before a Committee unsigned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.31 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Forth Ports Authority (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other order that is before us, namely, the draft Caledonian MacBrayne Limited (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure, Mr. Lofthouse to serve under your chairmanship. I hope that the content of these two draft orders will not be controversial. They prescribe the rateable values for 1991–92 for the operation of lands and heritages of the Forth ports authority and Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. For all other statutory dock and harbour authorities in Scotland, rateable values are calculated
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
each year by regional assessors, according to a formula prescribed by the Secretary of State in an order approved in 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forth ports authority and Caledonian MacBrayne are treated separately because in each case the lands concerned span more than one valuation area. Consequently it would be awkward to have their valuations carried out by different regional assessors acting independently. We have therefore arranged for the valuations for these two undertakings to be calculated by officials following the same method that is applied to the other statutory port authorities and then to be apportioned among the local authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister whether the valuations are affected by the proposals for the new arrangements at Rosyth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the announcement about Rosyth does not affect the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuations are calculated by officials following the same method that is applied to the other statutory port authorities and are then apportioned among the local authorities concerned. The figures are in the draft order. The resulting rateable values are then prescribed. The method of valuation is to assess the rateable value at 9 per cent of the relevant income of the undertaking. Relevant income is the total income for the year, less that for certain defined activities which are not related to the occupation of property or are connected with properties separately assessed. This method is the same as that used for assessing other statutory ports in Scotland and south of the border. The apportionment of the rateable value of each undertaking among the relevant authorities is made on the basis of its relevant income in each area and is set out in the draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessments and provisions contained in the orders have been the subject of consultations with the authorities involved, with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and with the Scottish Assessors Association. I am happy to assure hon. Members that those organisations are content with the draft orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell me what part of the FPA is in Dunfermline district? I am puzzled about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is a relatively small part of the ports authority, as the hon. Gentleman will see from the apportionment. The apportionment has been worked out technically. In the course of the debate I shall endeavour to produce further details about what part is in Dunfermline district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another important point. I do not know of any part of the FPA that is located within the boundaries of Dunfermline district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to advice, my view is that the part within that area is Burntisland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. Burntisland is not in Dunfermline district, it is in Kirkcaldy district. I know the FPA from A to Z. I can reel off all the locations. I am baffled by this. The only installation that I can think of that might be within Dunfermline district council's area—but I am sure that the ports authority does not own it—is the Braefoot Bay terminal. I am fairly certain that that is owned by Shell Exxon. There is no part of the FPA in Dunfermline district. I do not understand why Dunfermline district will receive an apportionment under the order. The order is faulty. I think it would be wise to adjourn the Committee, Mr. Lofthouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for debate and not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall raise it as a matter of debate, Mr. Lofthouse. If my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) is right and there is no part of the Forth ports authority within the area that is covered by Dunfermline district council—the Minister implied that the area in question is Burntisland, which is in Kirkcaldy—the order becomes entirely invalid. What is the point in considering an order in which a local authority is listed and to which money will presumably be paid, if that money should go to another district council? Dunfermline district council's area does contain the Rosyth dockyard, as my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) observed. Can the Minister tell me what area is in Dunfermline and whether the entire order is faulty because it should state Kirkcaldy instead of Dunfermline? Is the Minister now in a position to tell us the facts? I am happy to resume my place for 30 seconds while he does so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman, as I have already said, that the order does not apply to the Rosyth dockyard. That is because the base is not part of the FPA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but has the Minister not yet managed to clarify the order? He is supposed to be informed and to know what he is talking about. I gather that he gave us his long speech rather than his short one because he felt that some hon. Members wished for more clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the properties of Caledonian MacBrayne that are referred to in the order? There are the terminal buildings that the company operates from, and some are owned by the Clyde port authority and some are not. We need to know, particularly in view of what my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East has said, what and where these properties are. My hon. Friend may wish to return to the matter, and I shall leave it to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a few words about Caledonian MacBrayne because we should have some explanation of what is involved. The Minister said that the calculation is based on 9 per cent of income. Presumably that income is a proportion, in Caledonian MacBrayne's case, and applies to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
office and terminal buildings. It cannot be 9 per cent of Caledonian MacBrayne's total income, because presumably it does not cover the income from its ferry operations to Arran.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who has travelled on the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry six times in the past three weeks, I take the opportunity to congratulate what is still, quite rightly, a state-owned concern on its efficiency. Every ferry that I have taken has left on time and has arrived on time. If anything, the ferries have arrived marginally early. Caledonian MacBrayne is to be congratulated, particularly on its service to Arran. The organisation is not always complimented by Members of Parliament, but in this instance it is running an especially good service. I also congratulate Caledonian MacBrayne on the new car park at Ardrossan, which is presumably covered by the order. The car park is better laid out and more secure than before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham), representing the Inverclyde district council, wishes to know what properties in Gourock will be involved. He was delighted to hear that the headquarters are not to be moved from Gourock to the constituency of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie). If the Minister could give us slightly more detail on what the order involves, Opposition Members would be considerably happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on the order because I do not know a great deal about the subject. I can just hear the Minister saying that that has not prevented me from commenting on other orders in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of points for the Minister. First, I do not understand the principle that has been adopted. In the Forth ports authority area lie the Leith docks, which are in the Lothian region. Although district councils are referred to, the assessors are employed not by district councils but by the regional authorities, and it is the regional assessor who assesses the rateable values. There would be three regional assessors. The regional assessor from Fife would assess the rateable values regarding Burntisland, Kirkcaldy and the remaining part of the port authority's facility at Methil. The regional assessor from the Lothian region would assess the land of the Leith docks and the regional assessor from Central region would assess the land, property and valuations at Grangemouth docks. For the life of me, I do not understand why that should not be the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unique to find companies with land and heritable property in different regions. In the whisky industry, Bells is a good example: it has plants throughout Scotland. Instead of the proposal that is before us, it is subjected to the assessment that is levied on it by the regional assessor for the area in which its plant is located. British Petroleum is another good example. It has plants throughout Scotland with different rateable valuation areas, which are subject to the different rateable values that are applied by the different assessors. If there is an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
appeal, a comparison is often made between what one assessor has levied and what another has levied in a different region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that we are about to be enlightened as to which part of the FPA is in the Dunfermline district. If the answer is none, there is no point in my going any further, as I suspect that the Minister will want to withdraw the order. Before I develop my argument to a fine point, is there any possibility of my being told which part of the FPA is in the Dunfermline district?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister's silence mean that we have spent money on a phone call and we still do not know which part of the FPA's area is in Dunfermline district? The Committee is in difficulty. I know the FPA area from A to Z, and I do not know of any part of it that is in the Dunfermline district. If that is right the order is seriously flawed. The Minister should say now that he will withdraw it. It is obvious that he does not know which part of the FPA is in the Dunfermline district. Perhaps the Minister is smiling because Dunfermline district will get £93,000-worth of rateable value—the district is smiling too. When I was in the Post Office, phone calls were answered much more quickly than this. Something should be done about the service that British Telecom offers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary to treat the FPA with one valuation for lands and heritable property located in three different regional valuation areas in Scotland? Why should it be treated differently from the Distillers Company, which is subject to the various regional valuations that are applied by the assessors? Why should the FPA be treated differently from British Telecom or Imperial Chemical Industries, whose plants are situated throughout Scotland? Why should it be treated differently from electronics companies, all of which have their property assessed by the assessor in the region where the plants are located.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with a unique situation. The Scottish Office is placing the same rateable value on lands and property in Grangemouth as in Leith, Burntisland, Methil and Kirkcaldy, when the purpose for which the lands and buildings are used is often completely different. There is no comparison, for example, between the purpose of the lands and building in the port of Grangemouth and that of the land and buildings in the harbour at Burntisland. There is only one use to which the land and buildings at Burntisland are put, and that is the import of alumina for the British Alcan alumina plant at Burntisland. That is all that goes into and comes out of that harbour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The front page of the order that we are debating states that the order was laid before Parliament under section 6 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975. I am relying on the hon. Gentleman's memory because that measure was introduced by a Labour Government of which he was a Minister. Why was it determined in that Act that areas should have different rateable values?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never try to educate the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). Although the Act is described as the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975—it has been somewhat amended since then— it was introduced in part by the Conservative Government in 1974. It is called the 1975 Act—I know that I am straying from the point, Mr. Lofthouse, but the hon. Gentleman is entitled to some education now and again—only because the local authorities in the regions and the islands and the district councils came into being in 1975, although the elections took place in 1974. That year was disastrous because all that happened was the appointment of officials who, in my view, were running riot because no councillors were available to supervise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the question is that the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) and the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Munro) were the two Under-Secretaries who steered the measure through Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving the answer that I expected. Will he tell us why, when he was the Minister responsible in 1974–79, he did not bring in the change? Instead, we have had the opportunity to listen to his views today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We should now return to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the question, Mr. Lofthouse. The Labour Government were too busy building hospitals, houses and roads to be bothered with trivialities.

I shall return to the order. The problem is that the older I become and the longer I am in the House the more simple I become, and I allow hon. Members to lead me astray. I am a simple chap and I am easily led astray. I apologise to you, Mr. Lofthouse, because I should not fall into the trap set for me by vicious, nasty people such as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). It is disgraceful that they should tempt me from the straight and narrow and put me in a bad position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying before I was interrupted, the land and buildings at the FPA Leith docks are used for a different purpose from the land and buildings at the FPA docks at Grangemouth in my constituency. They, in turn, are used for different purposes from the harbour and docks at Burntisland and at Kirkcaldy. The development possibilities of the land available are also different. In my view, there is not the same possibility of development at Leith as there is at Grangemouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Falkirk district council—again, it seems that I am about to be enlightened—has said that it is prepared to operate the accelerated planning procedures to facilitate the development at the harbour at Grangemouth. If I see a note being flashed across to the Minister, I shall give way. I am curious to know what part of that operation is in Dunfermline district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
A flash of enlightenment has come upon me. I assure the hon. Member that the FPA owns part of Braefoot Bay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. I tried to get the Minister off the hook by suggesting Braefoot Bay, but the vast majority of that development is owned by Shell—Exxon—there is no shadow of a doubt about that. That further complicates the issue. If the FPA has a small part of the development—I suspect it will be for dredging the channel up the Forth to allow vessels to berth at Braefoot Bay, so it will be minimal—and in exchange Dunfermline district council receives £93,000-worth of rateable value as opposed to the rateable value allocated to Falkirk district and to Edinburgh city district, that will be a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The implication is that for a mere dredging operation the FPA is receiving about £800,000 a year. The Minister said that the amount was based on 9 per cent of the income of the property. If that is so, the FPA is making a great deal of money out of the operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The FPA makes a great deal of money out of non-port operations. Anyone who studied the balance sheet of the FPA would realise that it would be running at a loss if it were not for the profit from non-port operations—the import and export of cargo. At Grangemouth, the profit results from oil and gas crossing the jetty to BP; it has nothing to do with container traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years the emphasis of the FPA has changed. However, I do not accept—it makes no difference what the previous Labour Government did—that the Scottish Office should decide on a common rateable value across three regional boundaries. I do not accept that principle. Any other industry located in the three regions that has plants in any other parts of the regions is subject to the normal process of rateable value. I do not understand why the FPA should receive such privileged treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to an issue that may be nagging at the mind of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. In the past the difference in steaming distances, such as that between, say, Leith and Grangemouth and Kirkcaldy and Methil, meant a significant difference in fuel costs for the owners of vessels. The shipping agents, who attracted work to the ports, had to be able to offer comparable rates to the shipper—the person who was bringing cargo in or sending it out. If the port of Grangemouth was disadvantaged because of favourable rateable treatment in Fife, its cargo-handling ability was affected. However, that is no longer the position. The only port owned by the FPA on the east coast of Scotland that accepts cargo is Grangemouth. Leith port is used for pipe coating and the import of high-tensile steel pipes for the North sea oil industry. Bulk cargo container traffic is, by and large, located in Grangemouth. No advantage will be gained by the uniform rating system that is introduced by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will comment in greater detail about the position of the FPA. The legislation
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that is passing through the House of Commons will, I suspect, receive Royal Assent before the House rises for the summer recess. The FPA will then become a trust. The Clyde port authority went through a similar process. The present board members of the FPA will become trustees, and the trustees will become the directors of the new Forth ports plc. Does that have anything to do with plans to privatise the ports? If so, I hope—that is as much as I can do—that the port of Grangemouth will not be disadvantaged. I hope that development is attracted into the massive area of spare land that is presently owned by the FPA at Grangemouth docks. Falkirk district council has made it clear that it is prepared to operate the accelerated planning procedure to develop that land. Whether the FPA emerges as a trust port authority or a private organisation, I hope that nothing in the order will be detrimental to the possible industrial development at the port of Grangemouth. I have to add, as a warning to people outside the Committee, that I have read all the scatter-brain ideas about building luxury houses, for example. In my opinion, the land around ports is not appropriate for the building of houses costing £250,000. The sooner developers are told that, the better. They shoud use the land surrounding the ports and the facilities that exist there for their original purposes—for industrial development and the attraction of business to the port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can assure me that the order will help attract business to the ports, I shall resume my place immediately. I suspect, however, that he cannot give me that assurance. Scottish ports, whether they are scheme ports under the now-abolished dock labour scheme or non-scheme ports such as those at Perth or Montrose, all suffer from the same great disadvantage—the so-called grid scheme. Under that scheme, shippers do not bring their vessels to Scottish ports. In the whisky industry, for example, the shippers tell the exporters that they will take what is to be exported by road to Felixtowe at their own expense, as it is cheaper for them to pay the road haulage costs than to take a vessel to Grangemouth or Leith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, goods are taken from Perth and all over Scotland to Felixtowe, from where they are exported. Ten years ago, 75 per cent of the goods made in Scotland for export were exported from Scottish ports. That figure has fallen now to 23 per cent. The Minister should understand that I am not making a party political point and that I do not blame the Government for the decline. However, if the trade keeps falling, Scottish ports will be forced to close down, and the grid scheme with its free road haulage will end as well. That will leave Scottish industry at a disadvantage. The goods will still have to go to Felixtowe by road, but the exporter will have to pay the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take that on board and will ensure that the order will not be detrimental to the future development of the ports authority network in the east of Scotland. Whatever form the FPA takes—and I do not want to get into an argument about privatisation now—the east of Scotland ports face a marvellous opportunity. As the Minister knows, however, decisions have been taken on which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
goods will not be allowed to pass through the channel tunnel. Such goods include bulk liquid petroleum and bulk liquid gas. The bad news for whisky drinkers is that, because of its high volatility, whisky will also be prevented from passing through the tunnel. Most of these goods are produced in Scotland, and it would be tragic if the massive exports of such commodities had to go through ports in England. The Scottish Office must work to co-ordinate a programme to ensure that the commodities are exported through east of Scotland ports. I make no partisan point, but steaming distances and other factors mean that ports in the west of Scotland do not lend themselves to that type of export trade. The industrial ports are in the east of Scotland. Nothing in the order should damage the ability of Grangemouth, Kirkcaldy and Leith to capitalise on the new opportunities that will arise. It is an irony that they will arise because of the opening of the channel tunnel, but the opportunities will be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that has nothing to do with the order, but I think that it has. Even if there is that disagreement between us, I hope that he will closely examine the points that I have made and make sure that the exports go out of Leith, Grangemouth and Kirkaldy and that the east of Scotland ports, under the control of the FPA, benefit from the opening of the channel tunnel in a way that no one thought possible when it was first decided to build it. Those are the assurances that I seek, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give some of them, I am still not happy about the Braefoot Bay point, and he will not blame me or accuse me of not believing him if I tell him that I shall check it myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) has a clear knowledge and understanding of the ports, not least in his capacity as Member of Parliament for the Grangemouth area. I was interested in his comments on the wider issue of the future of the ports. I recognise clearly one aspect of what he was describing, the fact that so much freight from Scotland is not being exported through the ports but is going down by road to the English east-coast docks, in many cases along inadequate roads such as the A 1 which passes through my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that we have been able to identify part of a Forth port in Dunfermline district, although I am now even more intrigued and anxious to discover how the apportionment has been fixed. I am perfectly happy that Falkirk, Dunfermline, Kirkaldy and Edinburgh city districts will get the product of the unified business rate, based on the figures in the schedule to the order. It is fair to probe how the calculation is carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all the costs associated with having a port in the area are borne, or may be borne, by the district council within the boundaries of which the port is located. There may, heaven forbid, be an accident in the Firth of Forth involving a cargo of oil and there may be oil spillage that could cause much pollution on the north and south coasts of the firth. Such
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
spillages are no respectors of district council boundaries. Any of the district councils on the coast of the Firth of Forth in Lothian, Fife, the Borders or even further afield could be faced with the costs of dealing with that problem. Can the Minister explain how that aspect of potential costs is dealt with in the allocation of revenue support grant and so on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of the order deals with the non-domestic water rate and reads:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The non-domestic water rate shall not be leviable in respect of the prescribed class of lands and heritages in respect of the financial year 1991–92."</p></blockquote>
The prescribed lands and heritages are the whole of the docks and ports under the FPA. As I understand it, every other business is liable for the non-domestic water rate. I presume that the Minister will tell us that all the water supplies to the docks are metered and are charged on that basis, but that does not need a special order. It is already covered by local government finance legislation. Where a business derives all its water supply through a metered supply which is charged for directly, there is no need for a special order through a Committee of the House. Why are we being asked to pass paragraph 4, which expressly exempts the docks from the non-domestic water rate? It is a detailed point and there is doubtless a reason for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) on the point about Dunfermline district; it is part of Braefoot Bay. I shall let him have a detailed account of the precise facilities if that will help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) made a general point about the basis of the calculation. I assure them that it is common throughout Scotland, England and Wales. For many years statutory ports have been subject to formula or central valuation, and that has applied on the same basis to Scottish and English ports from 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Lothian virtually answered his own question about water rates. Water consumption is metered uncharged, so applying the non-domestic water rate would mean double rating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both my hon. Friends asked why regional authorities are not included in the sums that are involved. I refer briefly to Caledonian MacBrayne. The regional authority is the transport authority in the area, and the Clyde ferries especially are seen very much as part of the transport authority. It is, however, the road authority. The road that comes from the Claonaig ferry from Arran presents more than one problem. It needs upgrading because it could not take the lorries and transport that could come from it. Its upgrading would be a regional function. Can the Minister explain why regional authorities are not included in the figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that, as it relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East about whether valuation methods are satisfactory. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
assure the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, first, that there is no relationship between the order's provisions and possible privatisation. This is a continuation of the system that has operated for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East made interesting points about the channel tunnel and its effects of trade. I have noted them, and I shall study them carefully, but perhaps they are not directly related to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East rightly made a more general point about whether the method was satisfactory. I assure the hon. Member for Cathcart that the local authority non-domestic rate is the region rate plus the district rate applied: that is the basis of the figures. I remind the hon. Member for Falkirk, East that, in the past, conventional methods of valuation have proved difficult to apply to public utility undertakings, especially those that consist of a network of wires or pipes that crosses several valuation area boundaries. The practice of valuing has therefore been operative for a number of years. I accept the contention that the practice is not entirely satisfactory. We intend, in consultation with all interested parties, to review the scope for conventional valuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, who is being helpful. My understanding is that pipes are not rated. Was not the Minister responsible for a measure that took pipes and pipelines outside rateable values? In my constituency BP is still grateful to the Minister for ensuring that they are not so rated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Broadly speaking, the hon. Gentleman is correct. However, there are problems of definition. I was saying that some areas had difficulty applying the valuation principles to a network that crosses several valuation area boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not feasible to go further now because of the workload on the assessors. The next evaluation is in 1995, which is perhaps the earliest date at which change might be made, given the need for the assessors to collect essential information about each undertaking. I assure the Committee that we understand the point about this method not being entirely satisfactory. The hon. Member for Cathcart made that point well. We shall make the necessary changes and set up a working party that will reflect all the relevant interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant authorities, COSLA and the Scottish Assessors Association are content with the orders
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
and the formulae. On that basis, I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did informally ask the Minister a question. I may be wrong, but I always assumed that the Skye ferry was run by Caledonian MacBraync Ltd. If that is so, there are no moneys in the order for the relevant local authority for slipways or offices on Skye and on the mainland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The coverage of these districts has not changed for several years. I assure the hon. Gentleman that CalMac does not have relevant operational lands and heritages in local authority areas other than those specified in the orders but I shall examine the point and be in touch with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raise the point because there is considerable concern that once the bridge is built, which will be a private enterprise bridge, the ferry may cease to operate. Many people would find it most unsatisfactory if the people of Skye and tourists were not offered a ferry as an alternative to what may be a very high-cost bridge. I wondered whether the order reflected the fact that the bridge was going to be built and that Caledonian MacBrayne was going to cease operations across to Skye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that cannot be the case because the order refers to the current financial year. The facilities at Skye are not covered by the orders and have not been covered by previous orders. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about any point that he wishes to pursue. On that basis, I commend the orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
