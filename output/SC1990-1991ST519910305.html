	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Standard Community Charge (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1991.—[
	<i>Mr. Allan Stewart</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, we shall also consider the Community Charges (Registration) (Scotland) (No. 2) Amendment Regulations 1991</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In so far as the regulations apply a little more sticking plaster to the firmament of poll tax legislation they are welcome, but I hope that the Minister will state the Government's thinking and put the regulations in context. The Committee must be aware of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to read an article in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> by David Hencke, its well-respected local government correspondent, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only the future of the poll tax is causing angst and disarray in the Conservative ranks"—</p></blockquote>
I take issue with the word "only"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"with Michael Heseltine's community charge committee unable to report to Mr. Major with a solution … The situation has now worsened after the Scottish Office election working party declared UDI on the issue."</p></blockquote>
If that is correct, it is highly relevant to the regulations. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang, and Scottish Ministers Michael Forsyth and Allan Stewart are demanding that whatever Mr. Heseltine does in England and Wales 'the community charge remains the fundamental principle of local taxation in Scotland.' This raises the spectre of the United Kingdom having three different sets of local taxation—the community charge in Scotland, unreformed rates in Northern Ireland and Mr. Heseltine's new local taxes in England and Wales."</p></blockquote>
Is that report accurate? Is it conceivable that the Conservative party in Scotland wishes to retain the poll tax in Scotland, while the rest of Britain is allowed to escape from it? If Scottish Tories try to foist the poll tax on Scotland while the rest of Britain escapes from it, the fury of the electorate would not equal anything that we have seen. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government have no such intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are not unwelcome but they are sticking plaster and they confirm that the primary legislation is fundamentally and irredeemably flawed. It is astonishing how regularly the Government introduce regulations that make further exemptions and clarify and rebut their previous statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Standard Community Charge (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1991 make further exemptions for relatively small categories of the standard community charge, for which the multiplier is reduced to a half or zero. How many properties are affected by the changes? I suspect that only a tiny proportion of the properties covered by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
standard community charge will be affected. The Minister indicates agreement, but I should be grateful if he clarified the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations do nothing to relieve the injustice of the standard community charge. The general horrors of the poll tax mask the particular unfairnesses of the standard community charge. At least under the poll tax rebates are possible and wealth and income is taken into account to distinguish between the richest and poorest people. We all know that it is inadequate, but at least it offers a system of rebates. Means are not taken into account under the standard community charge. The Government long ago abandoned any pretence that it is a personal charge. It is the crudest of property taxes—a flat-rate property tax. As a result, people who own substantial second homes made a killing, but the people who own the tiniest of second homes—a tiny flat or property but their only luxury in life—have been hammered by the poll tax and by the standard community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the old system, and old lady in my constituency, who owns a small property on the island of Arran and who is not creating any social dissent about people who own second homes, paid£80 in rates, which was appropriate to the size and amenity of that property, but under the poll tax she must pay more than£800. She has quite substantial means, but even she is faced with the prospect of giving up that property. There cannot be any justice in that, and because of the Government's insistence on a flat-rate charge the local authority cannot make any allowance for such a second property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Strathclyde regional council would be only too willing to apply a lower multiplier to distinguish betweeen such properties and a large property, but it is not allowed to do so because if it uses a multiplier of a half for a small property it must use it for the largest second homes within its area, thereby creating a shortfall that will have to be made good by poll tax payers. The local authority is in an impossible position, because if it seeks to be as fair as it is allowed to be to owners of tiny second homes, of which there are many in my constituency, it will be unfair to its other poll tax payers. It will increase the burden on them by giving an even more enormous tax break to the owners of the largest second properties in that local government area. That is a massive anomaly which the Government, even if they were not thinking of reforming the poll tax structure in general, could have done something about under the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result has been not to free properties into the market but that a huge number of second properties in my constituency and elsewhere are up for sale. Millport is a classic example, because owners of second properties cannot afford to keep them but nobody else can afford to buy them and a collapse in the property market has ensued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemptions to the standard community charge are welcome and long overdue. All the points that are embodied in the explanatory note were made by Opposition Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. BM Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And by Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that. It has taken a long time and much suffering and unhappiness, particularly among elderly people, to reach the stage that we are at today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The Community Charges (Registration) (Scotland) (No. 2) Amendment Regulations are a mixed bag. They provide several exemptions and a power that I do not want to see —the right for a registration officer to sell register entries at the rate of£2 per thousand. To whom will those entries be sold? Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on who the customers at£2 per thousand register entries will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that women's refuges will cease to be liable for the collective community charge—another absurdity that was debated hour after hour before we finally got that tiny concession—and the exemption from the personal poll tax of certain persons aged under 20 who are undertaking certain qualifying courses of education. Surely it is logical to exempt all students from the poll tax and to abandon the ridiculous charade of spending more money on trying to collect the tax from students than is realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us hope that the report in 
	<i>The Guardian</i>that Scottish Tories wish to retain the poll tax and thereby heap insult on the substantial injury that has already been done, is wrong. Given that beleaguered state of the Tory party in Scotland, it is trying to hang on to what little it has. The Minister will experience problems when he tours the leafy suburbs of Eastwood, use the words of President Nixon's former press secretary, Ronald Ziegler—"all previous statements are inoperative" —and tells his constituents that a property tax is a splendid notion. I know that the Minister will have some difficulty explaining that, but he should think of his lesser brethren—Tory candidates in other parts of Scotland who are trying to work their way up the ladder and who are fed up with being ridiculed and reviled about the poll tax. If the Minister's English colleagues are throwing in the towel, let him and the Secretary of State be man enough to admit that the poll tax, one of the few things still to be made in Scotland due to the policies of the Government, was a disaster and has been a nightmare in every aspect of its implementation. Let us get rid of the patient, then we shall not need the sticking plaster that is being applied today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) that the Scottish Office will not indulge in UDI. I refer him to the excellent interview with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in today's 
	<i>The Scotsman.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Prime Minister displayed his deep knowledge of Scottish local government by referring to parish councils and city councils. That is a good start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not relevant to the community charge. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out the position with total clarity in 
	<i>The Scotsman.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are not controversial, and some of their provisions were suggested by Opposition Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker). There is no inconsistency in making these modest and detailed improvements and in subjecting all aspects of the community charge to fundamental review. We have made it clear that any major changes resulting from that review will not be in place for some time—possibly two or three years. The regulations are being introduced in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
light of experience and it is not surprising that, following the introduction of a new and complex tax system, some changes are sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the regulations, local authorities have the option of applying different multipliers. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North asked how many properties would be affected by the changes. I do not have such detailed information, but I assure him that it will be few. The main category will be job-related accommodation, such as second homes owned by ministers of religion or school teachers who are required to live at the school. The standard charge raises only between 1 per cent. and 2 per cent. of local authority revenue, so the consequences for local authority budgets are very small indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North asked who would buy the register entries referred to in the explanatory note. That power was under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989; the regulations simply prescribe a fee. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the information is closely circumscribed so as to allow personal information to be made available. Statistical information will be available, which will probably be purchased by those involved in research projects. There is no possibility of personal details being made available. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was fully consulted on the proposal. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman, and no doubt we shall return to the more general points that he made on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the Minister's protestations, the regulations show the Government's confusion on the poll tax. The fact that they are introducing regulations two years after the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland and almost three years since the primary legislation was enacted shows that the primary legislation was ill thought out and rushed through the House with minimal scrutiny, despite the fact that the majority of Scottish Members voted against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We warned not only of the injustice and the grave hardship that the poll tax would cause many people, particularly those on low incomes and their families, but that it would lead to a bureaucratic monstrosity. We said that poll tax officers and finance officers would have a mammoth task in trying to keep the register up to date and collect payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax is supposed to be under review, yet at this late date the Government have introduced the regulations. I notice that the two regulations cost£1 and £1.45p per copy, so it would cost£25 to provide a copy to each member of the Committee, quite apart from people outside the House who might want to buy them, although I should not imagine that they would go like hot cakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's explanation of the uncontroversial regulations left much to be desired. He is getting his money easily if he thinks that he is fulfilling the office of Minister of the Crown. It should not be left to members of the Committee to nod the regulations through having read the explanatory notes on the back page.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless one is a lawyer, much of the information on pages 2 and 3 of the Community Charges (Registration) (Scotland) (No. 2) Amendment Regulations is a lot of legal gobbledegook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he does not welcome the regulations? If so, will he tell us why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want the poll tax to be abolished completely rather than minor amendments being made to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Standard Community Charge (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1991 provide certain exemptions for people who have second homes. Should not priority be given to people who have no home? The fact that somebody does not have a roof under his or her head does not exempt that person from payment of the poll tax. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) is grinning like a Cheshire cat. A couple of weeks ago, I met a young person from Perthshire at a shelter for homeless people in London, who perhaps is a constituent of the hon. Member for Tayside, North. Many of his friends told me that part of the reason why they had left home was the burden of the poll tax. Young people are being forced out of their homes and are becoming homeless because they cannot afford to pay poll tax. Priority should be given to such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people who own second homes are not rich, such as those who live in tied housing and who are covered by the regulations. The town officer of Falkirk district council lives in a flat on council premises, but when he retires he will have nowhere to go unless he prepares in advance. Many people who are on low or medium incomes live in tied accommodation and must prepare for their retirement. A further obvious example is Church of Scotland ministers, whose salaries are not high. It is most unfair if such people are charged a double personal poll tax. The regulations give local authorities some discretion with the multiplier, but most of them use a multiplier of two for second homes. Local authorities will want to maximise income to continue to provide the services that are so essential to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members and local authorities may have thought that everyone who owns a second home is rich, so a multiplier of two should be applied. I favour a tax system whereby the rich pay more, the poor pay less and the very poor pay nothing. That is a progressive system of taxation, and I should like that principle to be applied to national and local taxation. It is over-simplistic to imagine that every second person who owns a second home is rich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following hon. Members' representations, the Government have at last introduced the regulations, but they took their time. I recall that the Secretary of State for the Environment announced the regulations just before the summer recess and the Scottish Office, as is its wont, followed suit. If the Secretary of State for the Environment jumped in the River Thames, I wonder whether the Secretary of State for Scotland would think that he had to follow suit. The Secretary of State for Scotland is a wise man, so perhaps he would send the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) in his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the people of Scotland have been suffering the poll tax for 12 months more than the people of England and Wales, I should have thought that the Scottish Office could have shown a better example and ensure that the regulations were laid earlier than 16 January. That is not exactly a greased-lightning reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community Charges (Registration) (Scotland) (No. 2) Regulations refer to exemptions for women's refuges and for certain people under the age of 20 who are taking certain qualifying courses of education. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
welcome and I am sure that the people who are most affected will be particularly pleased. However, it is incumbent on the Minister to say how many people are likely to be affected. If he cannot do so this afternoon, perhaps he will write to members of the Committee and give the Government's estimate of the number of people affected and the public expenditure implications. In a Bill, a little paragraph normally outlines its public expenditure implications. The regulations do not mention the public expenditure implications, but if local authorities suffer a loss of income as a result, I hope that the Secretary of State will make good the shortfall by increasing revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the revenue support grant for the financial year 1991–92 take into account the effect of the regulations on local government income? The Government's track record on local government expenditure is disgraceful. Figures provided by CGSLA show that in 1979–80, rate support grant, as it was then called, amounted to 67·8 per cent. of local government income and income from domestic rates was 11 per cent. For the financial year 1990–91, revenue support grant dropped to 55·9 per cent. of local authority income, and income from poll tax was 21 per cent. In other words, when the Government took over from Labour, central Government provided more than two thirds of local government income, whereas it is now only 55·9 per cent., and in 1979–80 the ratepayer provided 1 per cent., which has now risen to 21 per cent. More than one fifth of local government income is derived from the poll tax. That is the surest sign of the serious problems that are faced by every regional, district and islands council throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use Ministers blaming councillors or the people who refuse to pay the poll tax. Even if every person had paid every penny of their poll tax, there would still be a shortfall in local government income because of the massive cut in revenue support grant. The fault lies fairly and squarely with the Government, who have not given local authorities the support that they require to provide essential services such as education, housing and recreational and social work services for elderly, sick and disabled people.

Although the regulations are welcome, they are nothing to shout from the rooftops about. What is required is not ameliorating amendments to the poll tax but its complete abolition. Despite the many warnings that the then Secretary of State and the Minister received when he was a humble Back Bencher and despite the fact that they had no mandate from the Scottish people, they intransigently decided to proceed with the poll tax. They got themselves into this mess and if it had not been for the anti-poll tax campaign the Government, or the Scottish Office, would still be trying to defend it to the hilt. If it had not been for the widespread campaign of resistance, perhaps the previous Prime Minister would still be in No. 10 Downing Street, the present Secretary of State for the Environment would still be languishing on the Back Benches and the poll tax would be under no threat.

The Scottish Office should have taken the initiative for this so-called fundamental review. I hone that the Minister will take this opportunity to go into detail about the Scottish Office's contribution to the fundamental review. The Scottish Office could make a significant contribution by telling the Secretary of State for the Environment to abolish the poll tax and to replace it with a much fairer system of local government revenue raising, based on the

ability to pay and with a generous rebate system of up to 100 per cent. for people most in need. Surely that is not beyond our ken—surely it is not beyond our Allan. I plead with him to make his voice heard on behalf of the people of Scotland and to play his part in abolishing the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman mentioned the timing of the regulations. They are being introduced in perfectly good time for the next financial year. If they had been introduced in July it would not have made any difference as we were already well into this financial year.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned earlier the possibility of the Scotish Office clinging to the poll tax when the other rats, metaphorically speaking, are jumping from the sinking ship. Is the Minister telling me that in no circumstances—there are no members of the press here so we can talk as friends—would the Scottish Office cling to one system while the rest of the country adopted another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, I refer the hon. Gentleman to precisely what the Prime Minister said about the matter in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> I do not recall his exact words, but he made it absolutely clear that fundamentally different systems of local government finance cannot operate in different parts of the country. For the authoritative version, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the interview with the Prime Minister in this morning's 
	<i>The Scotsman.</i>

The hon. Member for Falkirk, West made several points about public expenditure, the RSG and costs. I assure him that the regulations were taken into account in the RSG settlement, but neither the numbers affected nor the costs are significant. They have no significant effect on local authority budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the numbers and costs? If the Minister does not know them, how can he say that they are not significant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that they are extremely small and are not significant. I do not have the detailed information that the hon. Gentleman asks for. He courteously asked whether I would write to members of the Committee with any information that became available, and I shall do that.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister told us the regulations have been introduced in time for the next financial year. In my naivety, I thought that they were being made in time for the next election. I shall take the Minister's word for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised by the panic to amend the poll tax. I was on the hustings recently and realised just how unpopular the tax is. I am sure that the Conservative party is panicking about facing people who are distraught about this unfair and unjust tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the changes made by the regulations but the poll tax is totally unacceptable. It is rather like giving a corpse two aspirins and hoping to revive it. The tax is not revivable; it is fit only for the bin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During any year we can expect an electoral register to be 3 per cent. out of date. When we checked it during the recent by-election in my constituency, we found that it was 15 per cent. out of date. I am sure that that was due in no small part to the poll tax. People were not registering and young people were forced to leave home because their parents simply could not afford to pay the tax for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A gentleman visited my surgery on Saturday who has been on long-term invalidity benefit. He has a 17-year-old who is not working, who is not on a job creation scheme and who therefore is not entitled to benefit. His father is still expected to find 20 per cent. of his poll tax. That young man makes no contribution to the household, and his father, who is on invalidity benefit, cannot make it for him. That shows that the poll tax is not only immoral but uncollectable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest figures from Strathclyde university show that 50 per cent. of people in Strathclyde have not paid the poll tax. On further investigation, it found that 80 per cent. simply could not pay. My constituents have told me that they want to pay their taxes but cannot do so because there is not enough to go round. The Minister must recognise that there is no room for fiddling with the tax. He must admit that it is unworkable and uncollectable. The quicker we get rid of it, the better.

People who owned second homes in the west of Scotland often worked in industrial areas. Those second homes on the Clyde coast in constituences such as Cunninghame, North were tiny abodes. They were the one luxury for which those people had worked all their lives. They had probably given up smoking and going out and their one luxury was their single end at the coast, which they visited once a year for a fortnight and from which their families benefited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That one luxury has been taken away and those small communities will become derelict because the people who came from Glasgow and the surrounding area to visit their second homes at weekends or in the fair holidays were their only source of income. That loss has had a gross effect on small communities on the Clyde coast and on the people who worked all their lives to own a second home but who now cannot realise any benefit by selling it because the price has dropped out of the market as a direct result of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that students and people in women's refuges will welcome the exemptions in the regulations, but it is not enough. We can tinker all we like, we can plaster over the cracks, but it will not help. The poll tax is not fair. We must

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) perfectly described the problem with second homes on the Clyde coast. The Minister did not answer my question. Will he attempt an intellectual justification for charging people who own tiny second homes, perhaps with one room and an outside toilet and no facilities, the same as the owners of the grandest second homes such as castles or mansions? How can it be right to say to a local authority, "Forget the level at which the multiplier is set"? How can it be right to say that one cannot differentiate between two properties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consumption of local authority services is unrelated to the size of property. I reassure the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has had 15 minutes to think about that as the intellectual justification for the standard commuity charge: it takes a bit of beating to say that because of the consumption of services is equal, those in the tiniest property should pay the same as the grandest property on the land.
