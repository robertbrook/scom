	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great honour to speak from the Front Bench of the Conservative Party, but it is an even greater honour to speak on the fishing industry. Other industries are larger—numerically, perhaps, more important. Each one has its men of calibre and each has its particular fascination. But those who work at sea and those who handle their catch—often early in the morning at an hour when this House of Commons has begun to consider that it is time to go to bed—are among the best in Britain, and I am glad to speak on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be because the fishing industry is so much smaller than other industries—particularly agriculture, with which its product is in most direct competition—that it has fewer champions, less concern and less money. There is need to examine and to clarify the position of the industry for that reason alone, apart from the fact that I believe that the fishing industry has men of the quality and the calibre who can demonstrate to the country how years of petty division and mistrust can be answered, and the ensuing accord used as a basis for radical improvement in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental division in the fishing industry is between land and sea. Fishermen spend their lives on the water, and it is true to say that when they get home they have neither the time nor, sometimes, the energy to see properly to their interests. In consequence, it has often been easy in the past for unscrupul-
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
ous elements on the landward side to exploit the fishermen's labour, and make easy money at its expense. In return, it is not unknown for fishermen to fish to a quota to keep prices high, or in any other way open to them to embarrass the home market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this has bred bitterness and misunderstanding which are still there, although, perhaps, not in quite as acute a form as in the past. Nevertheless, it can flare up at any moment in any section, as, for instance, we have recently seen in the berthing dispute in Aberdeen. I believe that the abolition of that feeling is the prime requirement of the industry. It has bedevilled operations for too long, too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn now to questions of policy. The hub of the Scottish fishing industry is in Aberdeen. In 1963, 2,014,677 cwt. of fish, of a value of £6,691,276 were landed there. In 1964, 2,217,487 cwt. were landed. The next heaviest landings at any other port in Scotland were at Fraserburgh in 1963–514,197 cwt.—and in 1964, 431,108 cwt.—in other words about five times less than than Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of Aberdeen to the Scottish fishing industry is therefore unassailable, and its importance to that part of the country is also beyond disputs. Yet I have a letter from the Secretary to the Harbour Board in Aberdeen in which he states that expert advice has been given
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the condition of the wharves is such that they may have to be closed down completely at short notice."</p></blockquote>
If that happens, the fishing industry in Scotland will have to limp along, presumably, in any way it can, but it will have suffered a crippling blow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as though people do not know. There is general agreement about the serious condition of some of the wharves. The argument centres on who is responsible for doing something about them, for finding the money, etcetra. That is plainly the wrong point. I feel responsible, and I think that anyone genuinely concerned with the welfare of Scotland and its fishing industry feels responsible, too. I am sure that the Minister does, and I would urge him to provide help, amend the legislation, instill some urgency—anything to get the job done. I would far prefer to see the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
of State grappling with a repair fund than with a disaster fund. We must prevent Aberdeen fish market disappearing down the Dee. That is one of my suggestions on policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Aberdeen fish market raises a general question affecting not only Aberdeen but many other ports—the question of handling and selling the fish on the quayside. Let us take boxes as an example. In its Report this year the White Fish Authority mentions regulations aimed at stopping the transportation of fish in dirty or unsuitable boxes—regulations which, incidentally, the Government have not been able to confirm. The use of dirty boxes can damage all the other efforts in all the other sections of the industry to present a clean quality article to the housewife. It must end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many aspects of the fishing industry have been greatly modernised—catching methods, packing methods, distributive methods, cold storage. I am impressed, too, with the fact that most fishermen are prepared to concede that the selling and distribution of fish is a highly commercial and competitive process, and that the differential between the firsthand sale price and the retail sale price is usually a fair one. Nevertheless, the high standard of modernisation and advance is not uniform, and far from obvious on every quayside. Conditions in Aberdeen itself are far from good. I cannot commend too highly those who seek to bring them up to date or urge too strongly those who use such conditions as an excuse for slackness or inefficiency to participate more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of fleet, and how large a fleet, can we expect to have in the future? At the moment, a trawler owner can build a new ship if he scraps an old one. He can build a freezer trawler as he scraps two, or possibly three. Inevitably, this means a smaller fleet. But the position is worse than that. In a good year, Aberdeen trawlers can earn enough money to cover the liabilities of the present fleet—just; some 10 of them have had to be sold already. But even the fortunate ones cannot earn enough to cover the provision of a new fleet, and in ten or twelve years' time a new fleet will be urgently needed. At the same time, under present arrangements, the subsidy scheme for new building will
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
have disappeared. What is to happen? I can only tell the Committee what I think should happen. The grant and loan scheme should be reviewed. Trawler owners should be allowed to modernise on a one-for-one basis, and we should aim for expansion in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the inshore fleet? The position here is only slightly better. One or two new boats are being built, but very few. Costs of new building are growing, and it is becoming more difficult for fishermen, and particularly young fishermen, to find the 15 per cent. capital deposit they require. Again, I should like to see the country aim for a larger industry. Research has been put in hand to provide the information needed on which to build a new fleet of the right size, but it needs little research to know that we are already importing a tremendous amount of fish. I would far prefer to have that fish caught by British vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be argued that already there is difficulty in obtaining crews, not only for trawlers but for inshore vessels. The fact is that other countries, whose fishing industries have expanded while ours has remained static, back their efforts with considerable attention to recruitment and training in the fishing schools. We have only just begun to tackle that point. If we accept, as I do, the need for growth in our industry we must accept, too, the need to attract the right young people, and give them the training needed for highly-skilled and difficult work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unhappily, the Government's policy seems to lie in the opposite direction. It was announced last week that they had cut the subsidy scales for herring and white fish by 10 per cent. This confirms the forebodings about their intentions which prompted the associations concerned, as long ago as the beginning of May, to take the unprecedented step of asking for a meeting with the Secretary of State in order to discuss the position before the new regulations were laid before Parliament. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will meet them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, what is the aim of hon. Gentlemen opposite? Do they want a fishing industry, or do they think that it may be cheaper to buy our fish abroad rather than to support the industry at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
home? That is an economic theory which they have already applied, with, if I may say so, impressive innocence, to aircraft. Is the fishing industry to be treated in the same way as the aircraft industry? We are, it seems, to obtain our defence increasingly from America. Where shall we get our fish?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, apart from the 10 per cent. cut in the existing scheme, we have had very little action from the Government. The minimum prices scheme will involve Treasury participation—there has not been a move. As I have already said, the fishing industry is not remarkable for its unity, but it is united about the minimum prices scheme. Indeed, the Scots have been after it for years, and for this reason, that the day must come when men stop breaking their backs to bring in fish which no one wants and see it go to waste. They day must come, too, that when the fish are there, and needed, the fishermen will bring them in at a price which the processors can pay and still be able to compete in a highly-competitive and very tight world market. I therefore urge the Government to get a move on here. It will help to bring more stability and confidence where both are greatly needed—on the fish market as well as on the fishing boat; and, too, I think it will promote some measure of co-operation between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farmer receives a 33⅓ per cent. improvement grant for his farm. The boat is in exactly the same relation to the fisherman as the farm is to the farmer. Is there any reason why it should not be treated in the same way from the point of view of improvement? Have the Government considered having all inshore fishing boats paid either a daily rate of subsidy or a stonage rate of subsidy, at any rate, paid on the same basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I do not think that men who are not full-time professional fishermen should qualify for Government subsidy for any fish they land in their spare time, or in their holidays. Fourthly, why do the Government not assist the fishermen more to meet the cost of safety equipment? This equipment is not like, say, a safety belt in a motor car, because its provision is obligatory, but at the same time it is becoming increasingly
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
complex and therefore leads to a great additional financial burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to refer to conservation of fish stocks and scientific co-operation with the industry. The White Fish Authority is beginning to co-ordinate scientific research, and I welcome this. Not always are the scientists loved or even understood by their fellow men. So it is in fishing. The failures make more impact than the successes, but the greatest, and I believe it to be a needless failure, is failing to win the co-operation of and to enlist the aid of the industry which they are there to serve. I hope that the White Fish Authority and all the scientists concerned will bear that in mind when, for example, the Discovery next goes to the Faroes and that someone will take the trouble to explain to the industry why it is going, and what it is that is being learned. Otherwise there will be misunderstanding and suspicion as to the value of that kind of work, and yet that work can be invaluable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know far more about the sea which covers 70 per cent. of the world's surface. It is an unlimited treasure chest if we learn how to use it aright. At present it supplies only about 1 per cent. of human food and 12 per cent. of the protein component of the world's food, and yet even now it is estimated that it could provide enough protein to meet 10 times the need of the world's present population. Fish farming is an important example of what could be done. 
	<i>Apropos</i> what I have just said, I was glad to see that the White Fish Authority took the trouble to explain to Ardnamurchan what it is trying to do with fish farming in the Highlands and what it sees for the future. I have no doubt about the importance of that work. I think that it will grow greatly and greatly increase the industry's productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservation is more an international question and will take time to solve. This is another example in this world of where common sense is so obvious and so necessary and yet so much neglected. I believe it to be an important part of good husbandry, and I suggest that this country applies it as far as we can, that is, in our territorial waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is sometimes heard the idea of banning netting for fish within our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
territorial waters up to a certain limit, say, six miles, so that anyone who wants to fish in those waters would have to use lines and rely on the quality premium which such fish would fetch in the market. Anybody else would have to go outside the limit to use nets. That is the kind of idea which it is much easier to discuss than to put into practice. It would mean great difficulties for certain sections of the fleet and for a few years it might upset the balance of supply badly. Certainly it could not be introduced without great care and without enlisting the co-operation of the industry and others concerned, but it is a suggestion which ought seriously to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport is an issue which has rightly caused much publicity in the Press over the last weeks. I take the opportunity again to urge on the Government the absolute necessity of a good transport service for the small ports and the small consignments, often of highly valuable fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to conclude with what I want to see from the fishing industry and an indication of how we can achieve it. I want to see the industry at peace, united within itself, efficient, prosperous and growing at small cost to the nation, but giving an infinite return. So far as we in Parliament are concerned, this can be achieved through the industry's administration. I spoke about the division and suspicion and distrust which are never far beneath the surface in the industry, not only between the various sections, but often internally in the same sections. The only people far enough removed from the centres of the storms to deal effectively with this are the administrators, in this instance the Scottish Office, the Herring Industry Board and the Scottish Committee of the White Fish Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, they have not done so and they have failed for the same reason that those more intimately concerned with the industry, on whichever side, have failed—because they have hopelessly underestimated the lengths to which they have to go in order to win the confidence and the co-operation of those on either side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the winter of 1963, thanks to a fair amount of hard work and great Ministerial efficiency on the part of my
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
right hon. and hon. Friends, it was discovered that for some three months the Herring Industry Board had been making a mistake about its funds for fishmeal and oil in Shetland. The herring fleet had to lie up for weeks in consequence and it is typical of the Board's attitude that this event, which caused great hardship to the herring fishermen who were unable to work and not able to obtain unemployment benefit, was described as an unfortunately mistaken interpretation of the scheme. There was no admission of regret, or even apology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not now the point, although some such admission would have done the Board credit and gained it much support. The point now is the situation which I disclosed in the House on 22nd July last year, in which, while in 1946 there were 622 Scottish boats mainly concerned with herring fishing and in 1963 there were 189, in 1946 the Herring Industry Board employed 34 non-industrial staff and, in 1963, 68 non-industrial staff and about 114 industrial staff. Even excepting the industrial staff, this represents a rise of double the number of staff to deal with 433 fewer boats. I asked the Scottish office what the reason for that was, and the reply I had was that an inquiry was being made and its result would probably be made public in the Report of the Herring Industry Board. There is no such publication that I have been able to discover in the Board's Report or anywhere else. It is this kind of practice in administration which makes it so difficult to encourage efficiency, enthusiasm or even honesty in any industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1946 there were 622 Scottish boats and in 1963 there were 189, which is 433 fewer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More information about markets, frank dealing over costs and careful explanation of the differing problems in the different sides of the industry could all do much to clear the air and establish the partnership in enterprise which the industry needs. However, the administration must first establish a position of trust where mutual co-operation is possible. If it does, there is no limit to what the industry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
can achieve. We cannot ask for finer men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. George Willis)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) on his maiden appearance on the Front Bench and also on his speech which, while I disagreed with parts of it, I thought to be a good speech and well delivered. I could not help thinking, however, that the last five minutes were directed at his right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and his hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) because the events about which he waxed so furious occurred under the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, fisheries play a more important part than they do in England and Wales, and this is particularly true of the north-east and of the Highlands. In 1964 the value of our landings of sea fish was £17·3 million, amounting to nearly one-half of the total value in England and Wales, or about one-third of the Great Britain total. Our commercial salmon fisheries are, of course, a good deal more important than those in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, the fishing industry is now enjoying a very welcome measure of prosperity. In 1964 landings of white fish reached an all-time high—4,208,000 cwt.—and the value of the catch, taking white fish, herring and shell fish together, reached the record total of £17·3 million. Indeed, ever since 1961 there has been a steady increase in both the total weight and value of landings of sea fish in Scotland and so far this year landings are showing an upward trend compared with the same period in 1964.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for those interesting figures, but could my hon. Friend break down the £17·3 million into average earnings per boat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can try to get the figure later on, but I could not give it off the cuff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These results are being achieved in spite of a rundown in the manpower employed of 1½ per cent. per annum. This reflects the increased efficiency of industry attributable to modernisation of the fleet and improved techniques for fish and fish finding. To look at this over a longer period, the weight of the catch in 1964
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
was 20 per cent. greater than in 1938 with only 55 per cent. of the 1938 labour force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But many problems are facing the industry. Over-fishing, marketing and transport are but a few. They affect the industry and different sections of the industry in different ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East has often spoken about the herring fleets—and he returned to the subject this morning—and the great diminution in the number of boats employed. It is true that the number of boats principally engaged in herring fishing has fallen considerably in recent years. However, this is mainly the result of the fall in export markets for cured herring which used to absorb about two-thirds of output. The Herring Industry Board is always on the look out for opportunities for export and we still have a sizeable export of about 25 per cent. of our landings, spread over most forms of herring produce—kippers, frozen, canned and so on. We must face the fact that the home market for herring and herring products is likely in future to be the main outlet for our catch, and it is satisfactory to note that this has been remarkably steady for the last few years and is showing, indeed, a very slight upward tendency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fall in herring exports is, as I have said, the main feature but, of course, there are other factors, and one of the most important is that most modern boats—and I think that the hon. Gentleman tends to ignore this—used for herring fishing are dual or multi-purpose boats which can be used for other types of fishing. This enables the fishermen themselves to select the kind of fishing which suits them best and has in fact made the inshore section of the industry much more flexible. The switch from herring to white fish catching has been a most marked change in the industry and has contributed to the record white fish catch and to the fact that the Scottish inshore fleet brings in well over half the Scottish white fish catch. There are other factors, too, such as the exceptionally good reproduction of haddock in 1962 which made this species very prolific in most Scottish waters last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have also been other changes. There has been a steady trend among
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
the smaller white fish boats to change over to shell fish catching, particularly for nephrops or Dublin Bay prawns, better known in their processed form as scampi. There has been a spectacular increase from virtually nothing a few years ago to a catch last year worth nearly £750,000. This development has benefited all classes of fishermen, whether white fish, herring or the small-boat lobster men, many of whom have been able to indulge in it during slack periods in their more usual activities. It is this development which is mainly responsible for bringing the total value of the Scottish shell fish catch to over £1½ million, more than half the U.K. total. Better facilities for marketing, including storage and processing facilities at the ports, have helped fishermen to take advantage of the improved demand for most kinds of shell fish. There is quite a significant export trade in lobsters—much of it through English ports, but some direct by air—and also in scampi.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the background against which we recently had to consider the white fish and herring subsidies for the coming year. The conclusions we came to are embodied in the Orders recently presented to the House. Whilst I do not want to anticipate the debate in the House, there are one or two things I might say about the Orders and the subsidies generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework of the present subsidies we inherited from the last Government. Much of the hon. Gentleman's indictment of that policy was, if justified, an indictment of the previous Administration. In the case of the trawling industry—or, more precisely, of white fish boats over 80 ft.—the policy is enshrined in the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1962, which requires an annual reduction in the basic subsidies by between 7½ and 2½ per cent., with their elimination by 1972. That is the 10-year period. For the inshore section—that is, white fish boats of 80 ft. and less—and for herring vessels, viability is also the aim though it was recognised that it might take longer to achieve. Subsidies for this section are not automatically reduced each year but are fixed annually in the light of the conditions obtaining and the operating results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Opposition we gave our general support to this policy. Certainly, in 1961
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
and 1962 the difficulties encountered by the near and middle-water trawlers made it look as though the prospect of viability by 1972 was very poor, but the better results of 1963 and 1964 have been encouraging, and for the time being we are continuing the policy we inherited. We shall, of course, watch developments very closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the inshore and herring sections, the improvements which set in in 1963 were carried further in 1964, and so far this year total proceeds are 20 per cent. higher than for the same period last year, although there were some variations among the different size groups of boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The improvements were pretty general and, after careful examination, we came to the conclusion that the rates of subsidy should be reduced for the coming year. Our proposals involve a reduction broadly of the order of 10 per cent. I myself had an opportunity to discuss the proposals with representatives of the Scottish inshore and herring fishermen a fortnight ago, and am therefore fully aware of their feelings on this question and of the reason for which they think the current levels of subsidies should be continued—the long hours of work in arduous conditions, the relative attractiveness of shore employment and the upward trend of operating expenses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman talks about a cut broadly of the order of 10 per cent. is he not talking very broadly indeed, in that there is a 10 per cent. cut for the inshore vessels in white fish but a 12 per cent. cut for the near, middle and distant water vessels and a 17 per cent. cut for herring boats under 40 ft.? He has given a very broad description indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman takes an overall view of this—and I have been through these figures in great detail—he will find that roughly the figure is 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

has said. It is 10 per cent. on the 1962 figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can argue this further on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we accept that assistance has to continue but we shall never get any nearer to the objective of ultimate viability unless after one or two years, of relatively good times we make cuts. If cuts should not be made now at the end of two years of relative prosperity, the question arises as to when they should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to some details of the subsidy arrangements and in particular to the division between those on daily rates and those on stonage rates. I discussed this with the inshore fishermen a fortnight ago, and while we appreciate that they would like to see this difference withdrawn, we feel that, for the larger inshore and herring boats, the daily basis is the right one. But there are practical difficulties in administering this if it is extended to smaller classes. We will, of course, keep the point under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of certain people who were not fishermen obtaining subsidies. I understand that the amount involved is exceedingly small. We do not consider that it would justify the cost of investigating applications for subsidy from part-time fishermen who go into this with a view to trying to stop it, even if it were legally permissible to deny subsidy to people who have gone to sea, caught fish and sold them. There is some dubiety about that position. Even if it were possible, however, the administration involved would be far too expensive to justify any savings which would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operational subsidies are only one form of financial assistance given to catchers. Grants and loans have also been available for the building of new boats of all sizes from the largest trawlers to the smallest boats used not only for white fish and herring catching but also for shell fish. For the last three years grants for white fish boats have been available from the White Fish Authority on certain conditions designed to ensure that the catching capacity of the fleet is not increased. We have been reviewing
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
these arrangements in the light of the views of the Authority and of all sections of the catchers and hope to announce the conclusions of the review very shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently—in fact, in July last year—a vessel improvement scheme was introduced under which grants are available from the Authority for the improvement of existing vessels under certain broad headings which represent accepted ways of improving the economic operation of the vessels. In administering this scheme the Authority will judge applications for grants by reference to the criterion of whether the economic operation of the vessel in question or its efficiency will be increased by the improvement proposed. This has now been agreed and is in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Herring Industry Board has now proposed a similar scheme for herring boats, principally to enable suitable boats to be adapted to methods of fishing such as trawling which have not been normal in this country though effectively used by foreign fishermen. These proposals are also under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of safety gear and the cost of putting into effect new safety regulations. I know that there is some concern about this and there have been suggestions that a special grant should be made, but there is no power, I understand, to give a special grant for this purpose; but no doubt, as vessels are brought up to the new standards the costs of this will be included in the profit and loss returns and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, these are taken into account when the subsidy needs of the inshore and herring vessels are being assessed. That is the present position. We think that it will be accounted for to some extent and met in that way, but there is no power to give a special grant for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I would like to say something about the White Fish Authority and the Herring Industry Board. The hon. Gentleman attacked the Board but, as I have pointed out, that is an affair of the last Government and not this one. I understand that the Board has carried out a reorganisation of its structure. It has had an organisation and maintenance team in and has made certain changes within the working of the body itself. I want to pay tribute to both the Authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
and the Board. They are both constantly pressing for improvements in the techniques of catching and handling fish. They have both carried out investigations to this end of very great value to the industry, and the Authority, with its greater resources through its Industrial Development Unit, has added a great deal to our knowledge of the basic techniques of fishing operations and the handling of fish. I am sure that every one in this Committee would wish to express appreciation of the work done by both these bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following consultations with the industry, the Authority submitted at the turn of the year proposals for a statutory minimum prices scheme to replace the voluntary scheme in force at the main trawler ports and to extend its coverage to the principal inshore ports. At the same time it asked for Exchequer financial support for a system of guaranteed or fallback prices for fish which did not fetch the statutory minimum. I assure the Committee that this matter has been and is being pursued and I hope that it will be possible soon to announce a decision on the result of the consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the Chairman of the Authority laid special stress on the conservation of the living resources of the sea, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. This is a question of fundamental importance, not only to our fishing fleets but to those of other countries as well. Most of the fishing ground's in the north-east Atlantic are over fished. This problem can only be solved by international regulation, and the U.K. has always been in the forefront in tackling it, through the international organisations set up for this purpose. A great deal of the expenditure incurred by the Fisheries Departments on research, which totals over £1 million per annum, is devoted directly or indirectly to making our contribution to the international accumulations of scientific knowledge of the state of the fish stocks and of the effect of fishing on them on which international regulations must be based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far the regulations in force prescribe the minimum meshes for trawls and seine nets, and the minimum sizes of the prin-
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
cipal species of white fish which may be caught and landed. At its meeting in May the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission recommended increases in the minimum meshes in certain areas, but this alone may not be enough, and the Commission may have to turn its attention to other measures such as the limitation of catch or fishing effort. These are difficult questions, as I am sure everyone appreciates, and it is not easy to secure international agreement. It would therefore be rather unrealistic to expect very rapid progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally important as the regulatory measures themselves is the question of enforcement. I believe that in this respect the United Kingdom has a high standard, but practice varies. It is therefore gratifying to inform the Committee that the North-East Atlantic Commission has made some progress towards the introduction of an international or joint inspection system under which inspectors of any member country would be empowered to inspect vessels of other countries at sea. If agreement on such a scheme can be reached at the Commission's meeting next year in Edinburgh, I am sure that everybody will be very happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would take a long time to deal with all the other aspects of the Department's fisheries research, but I should like to say a few words about fish farming, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. This is an idea which has caught the imagination of a great many people. Fish cultivation has long been practised in certain countries. There are well-established trout farms, in the United Kingdom mainly for stocking, and, of course, oysters and other sendentary species are cultivated where sea conditions are favourable, but for most of the sea fish which we eat we are still at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaice have been successfully reared to the thumbnail size by scientists of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the White Fish Authority is developing this work in two ways. First, by the experimental rearing of plaice to marketable size in tanks, the point of interest here being to find out the best conditions for doing this, and whether it can be done on an economic basis. Secondly, the Authority is exploring the possibility of rearing in semi-natural conditions in enclosed waters, and is making a start at Ardtoe in Ardnamurchan. The physical problems of enclosure are being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
studied by the University of Strathclyde, and the environmental conditions required are being investigated by scientists in the Scottish Fisheries Department. This is all necessary background work, and will probably take some time. I think that this ought to be said, because many people are expecting immediate results. It is a mistake to expect quick results, because it will probably take much longer than a year or two for this work to reach fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far I have been dealing with the production side of the industry, but distribution and marketing are equally important. The hon. Gentleman was concerned about transport, but, as he knows, we have had meetings in connection with this, with the result that at the moment there is a moratorium, during which period—three months—it is hoped that it will be possible for the interests concerned to make satisfactory alternative arrangements. All that I wish to say about that is that the Department's local fisheries officers—and this came up in the House yesterday—will assist in exploring possibilities wherever they can. I made that promise to hon. Gentlemen when they came to see me, and that is still the position. We shall be only too pleased to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of marketing in general, the hon. Gentleman referred to Aberdeen, and had a great deal to say about the conditions there. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of Aberdeen. I, too, have been informed about the inquiries which are going forward, and also about some of the problems in the harbour. Following the recommendations of the Fleck Committee that there should be a port-by-port investigation of the structure, equipment and practices of the dockside at the major fishing ports, a working party was set up to do this work and the position is that the draft of the Working Party's report has been prepared and is now being considered by the members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite common knowledge that parts of the fish wharves are in a bad state of repair, but this is not a matter for the Working Party to deal with. Aberdeen is a commercial harbour owned and managed by the Aberdeen Harbour Board, and it is for the Board, in conjunction with the Town Council, which owns the fish market buildings, to con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
sider a scheme of repair and, if necessary, to seek financial assistance for the work. That is the position with regard to Aberdeen, and I do not think the hon. Gentleman would suggest that Aberdeen needs spoon-feeding in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I entirely agree that the position in Aberdeen is exactly as stated by the hon. Gentleman—I think I used almost the same phrases on many occasions last year in answer to questions by his hon. and learned Friend and others—this has been going on for some time. I know that the Department was doing its best to get both sides in Aberdeen to put their heads together and get something done. Is the Minister saying that in spite of the best efforts of the Department no movement is being made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, progress is not as rapid as we would like, and it is true that the Department is seriously concerned about the situation in Aberdeen, being fully conscious, as it is, of the importance of Aberdeen to the industry in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I ought to say more at this point. I think that I have answered most of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, but if I have not I shall read what he said and write to him about them after this meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might conclude by saying that I should like to associate myself and my hon. Friends with the tribute paid by the hon. Gentleman to the fishermen themselves. Strangely enough, I have a few fishermen in my constituency, and I know what kind of men they are. I have a great admiration for them. I think that most of us have a great admiration for the way in which they do their work. We are anxious to see that they get a fair and proper reward for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned with the future of this industry. Its future was considered by the Fleck Committee, and during the debates on the Floor of the House on the Fleck Committee Report I said that I did not know what result the Report would have on the Scottish fishing industry. We are certainly concerned with the future of the industry and we shall do our best to see that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
remains healthy, that it maintains its strength, and, if possible, is developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) on his splendid speech this morning, not only because of its content, but because of the method of delivery and the obvious knowledge which my hon. Friend has of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to associate myself with the tribute which has been paid from both sides of the Committee to the industry and to those who man it. These men constantly risk their lives for us and for our food supplies. It is fair to say that we often forget their wives, who, during bad weather, sit back at home—or attempt to sit back—waiting for their husbands, their sons and other relatives, who are at sea. It is perhaps fitting to remember that about a year ago there was the tragic disaster of the sinking in the North Sea of the Sirius from Buckie. I should like to pay my personal tribute to the skipper of that vessel. Needless to say, he received a great mental shock, apart from the physical damage which he suffered as a result of having his ship sunk under him. He saw his father drown, and as a result he suffered a great deal of nervous shock, but I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that that man, Skipper Smith, is going back to sea, and he has been provided with a grant and loan to get a new boat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Skipper Smith is a good skipper, but he is also an officer in the Naval Reserve. His is a typical example of the sheer guts and determination displayed by the men in this industry. He is the best possible type of man, but he is not alone in this industry, and they all deserve our full support and help, and we as a nation, and we in this Committee and in the House, should give them all the support we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East referred to subsidies. I am particularly sorry that at this juncture there is to be a reduction in subsidies. I agree that the Fleck Report said that it wanted to see a viable self-supporting industry within 10 years, that is by 1972, but I detected a possible threat in the Minister's remarks. Is there
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
to be a continual and continuing decrease in these subsidies from year to year? Are the Government not going to take notice of the various points which the Minister of State himself mentioned, the increase in costs, and so on? The hon. Gentleman went further. He made out a case for buying the safety equipment which is now compulsory in fishing vessels, but in the same breath he tried to justify the decrease in the subsidy. To my mind that is not logical thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must address himself to the problem here. The policy adopted by his Government in 1961—I agree that we supported it at the time with certain reservations—was that the industry, in so far as it concerns boats 80 ft. long, should become viable within ten years, and that the remainder should become viable as rapidly as possible, but it was realised that it would take longer. If steps are not taken when the industry is relatively prosperous, when are they to be taken? That is the question which has to be answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to rising costs. It is my contention that this is not the moment at which to decrease subsidies. There have been all round increases in costs, and I should like to give the Committee a few examples of what I mean. In my constituency there is one-fifth of the east coast fleet of Scottish fishing vessels, a total of 277 out of 1,496. That was the position at 31st December last. It is therefore true to say that the reduction of the subsidy will be felt as hardly in Banffshire as anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here are some examples of increases in costs over the past 10 to 20 years. In 1938, a 2⅜ in. manilla rope coil cost £1 12s. Today it costs £19, and five years ago it cost £12. This increase in costs is going on continually. Similarly, a full rig seine net cost £11 in 1938. In 1964 it cost £150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the stonage rate of subsidy the drop will be equally great. It is fair to say that, with the drop in the subsidy now proposed, the drop for a vessel under 80 ft. will be as much as £210 a year. This must be seen in relation to the overheads of the vessels which tie up in the north-east ports. They have to meet a levy of 1d. per stone to the White Fish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
Authority. Landing dues, which vary, can be as much as 7d. in the £. Over and above that, they have to meet commission on the sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the original intention of the introduction of these subsidies was to help to maintain and replace the gear of fishing vessels. How can the Government help to get overheads down? There are various methods. I want to make one suggestion. A grant could be made to local harbour boards or local councils for the provision in the smaller ports of bulk fuel installations. There is a difference of 3d. a gallon in the price of diesel fuel between the port of Macduff and Peterhead. The agricultural industry receives grants towards the housing of group machinery and for silages. Is it not possible for the Government to act under the Section of the Fisheries Act, 1955, dealing with improvements? Is it possible for the Government to assist in the erection of these bulk storage tanks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The white fish subsidy for Scotland in 1963–64 amounted to £1,650,000; £1,050,000 of that went to inshore vessels under 80 ft. That, taken with the figures I have mentioned previously, is a measure of the effect the reduction in subsidy will have 
	<i>vis-à-vis</i> the north-east, particularly my own constituency. I hope that the Minister of State will think again about this matter, because the position is getting desperate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to grants and loans. There has of late been some slight easing in the giving of grants and loans for new vessels. Up to now, over a period, only replacements have been allowed. The Minister of State referred to a 1½ per cent. decrease in the manning of fishing vessels over the past few years. We need to provide better inducements to get the younger men at sea. For instance, I was surprised to learn that there are no minimum standards of seaworthiness for fishing boats. I suggest that such standards be laid down and adhered to. I suggest that a compulsory certificate of seaworthiness should have to be secured every four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the difficulty of getting young men into the industry, may I refer to a scheme which is being worked out in certain north-east ports for apprenticeships? Under this scheme, which is run in conjunction with the youth employ-
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
ment officer, a boy going to sea receives a guaranteed wage of £5 per week. Schemes such as these need a great deal of encouragement and full Government backing and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Fleck Report thought that the fleet was at a satisfactory level. The Minister of State said that he thought that it would be a good thing if that state of affairs could be maintained and that the catching capacity should be maintained as it is at present. The Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts a worldwide protein deficiency. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East said, fish is one of the best sources of protein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned conservation. I suggest that there is room for an increase in the catch if we can get international agreement on various aspects of conservation. Fish, if I may mix my metaphors somewhat, are birds of passage. Recently we have seen a glut of haddock. No one knows or can predict the pattern of a glut or a scarcity of any one species over a number of years. We know that a great deal of tagging of fish is going on. We need much more research. We need much more international co-operation and, not least, cash to carry out these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Policy and policing must be international. There are possible answers. Is it possible by international agreement to have a close season during the spawning period? One obvious difficulty is the difference in temperature in various parts of the world. Again, would it be possible to agree internationally to have a form of rotational fishing—that is, by international agreement one area would be left alone for a specific period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fish farming has been mentioned. I understand that one of the great difficulties about this is the temperature of the water. If fish farming can be carried out in areas where heated water is being let loose into the ocean—for instance, by small sea locks—I suggest that this is a method whereby the necessary heating of the water to get proper fertilisation and early growth can be brought about. With our present knowledge, we cannot expect to get tremendous results very quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to the White Fish Authority's Industrial Development Unit. It, through its researches, has produced a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
comprehensive picture of the type of winches needed and the modifications required—for instance, the fixing of special brakes on to winches—to help the fishing industry in its methods of fishing. It has produced prototype warp meters, which have been installed on two vessels. I gather that the private skippers in whose vessels these have been installed are most enthusiastic about the results. These meters give the tension of the warps and as a result—this is a very important point—a great deal of time is saved. Fuel costs go down. It prevents a certain degree of wear and tear on the gear. The industry needs to give more facilities to the Industrial Development Unit in the equipping of vessels with their small gadgets and by allowing more officers of the Unit to go to sea in the vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, I suggest that more types of vessels need to be investigated, such as seine netters, for the introduction of some of the meters and experimental machinery which I have already mentioned. There is also room for a great deal of improvement in the sonar equipment at present available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of limits. I refer especially to the three-mile limit in the Moray Firth. I realise full well that this is a contentious subject. It was originally enforced—I emphasise the word "enforced"—to protect the line fishermen along the north-east coast and in the Moray Firth. The answer usually given is that, if the three-mile limit were abolished in these areas, damage would be done to the plaice spawned in these waters. I am advised that recently a good deal of work has been done on this and, contrary to the usual belief, plaice do not spawn on sandy bottoms. Rather do they spawn over rocky areas. Seine netters, by the nature of their work, cannot drag over rocky bottoms. If they do so, they are self-destructive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are various anomalies as a result of the retention of this three-mile limit. The classic example occurred in Randwick Bay last year. One vessel illegally fishing within the three-mile limit caught a good haul of really prime condition haddock. A boat fishing legitimately outside the three-mile limit and very close at hand brought on board 10 tons of haddock, only 2½ tons of which were suitable for landing. In other words, 7½
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
tons were not of a size which could be landed. This is an absolutely classic example. We do not know the migratory habits of fish. Till we know much more about them, I do not think we can say that the retention of the three-mile limit will help to secure the conservation of stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vessels under 80 ft., particularly the smaller ones in this category, are often prevented from going to sea by extremely bad weather. It is often impossible for these small boats to fish outside the three-mile limit in very bad weather. On the other hand, it would be possible not only for them to remain at sea, but to do a good deal of catching, if it were legitimate for them to keep within the three-mile limit. Perhaps we have not yet got enough data to come to a firm decision on this point. I ask the Government to keep it constantly under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another possible answer is to retain the three-mile limit for specific periods—for instance, during the spawning period. We know that there are migrations of young stock immediately after the spawning period. This again must be connected with international co-operation. We must try to get more information from abroad and, as the Minister mentioned, we need closer mesh sizes and heavier penalities for those infringing the law by taking aboard, and possibly having to dump, the smaller sizes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry is an essential part of our economy. It needs our sympathetic support, and that of all Departments of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Foreign affairs, Commonwealth affairs, Colonial affairs, all have their places in our political consideration, but this debate on fishing is very important for a variety of reasons, as I shall mention. That does not mean that I shall make a long speech; I shall not do so, because I know that many other hon. Members want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is important because it affects Britain's and Scotland's health and wealth. The vitamin content of fish has helped to make the British nation what it is. It affects the Scottish fishing industry's reputation, which is world wide: everyone knows the value of Aberdeen kippers. It is important because? the gallant and indefatigable fishermen who

bring this valuable commodity to our shores help to build up the prestige of the nation. It is directly and indirectly important to the economics of Britain in general, and of Scotland in particular, because of the wealth it produces. It is very important to the shipbuilding industry, because without ships we could not catch our fish. It affects our national employment problems and, in particular, the employment and unemployment problems of Aberdeen. In general, it affects our national prestige.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) on the way in which he castigated his own Government for their failure during thirteen years to attend to the needs of the fishing industry. As I listened to the hon. Gentleman I thought that the time might come during the next twenty years of Labour Government for him to cross the Floor and join us in our endeavours to help the industry. I hope he will; he would be an asset to our party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a clever speech, and showed courage in his criticism of the agricultural industry—he has many agricultural constituents—but, with respect, he missed several points. That is excusable, because the fishing industry is so vast and so varied that he could not be expected to cover every point. During the last thirteen years the Government failed to deal with many aspects of this industry as they should have done. The Minister of State has touched on that. Notwithstanding the exhaustive character of my hon. Friend's speech he, too, missed one or two points. When I congratulate the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East on his criticism of the invidious way in which the Government looked after the agricultural industry in contrast to their treatment of the fishing industry, I do not seek to attack agriculture. I realise that Aberdeen Angus beef also contributes to the success of this nation—perhaps not to the same extent as does the vitamin content of our fish, which is so valuable, but it certainly contributes something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the Government have not given adequate attention to the poaching by foreign Governments and foreign fishing fleets upon our fishing grounds. It is true that the present Government have done something by way of
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
legislation, but they have not gone far enough. Another matter that should be dealt with is the maintenance of the fishermen's international rights. There are conflicts between Scottish fishing rights and those of the Danish, Icelandic and Scandinavian fishermen, and they should be adequately considered. I have long favoured an international conference. I know that a recent conference was rather a failure, but I am still in favour of a further, more representative and more authoritative international conference on fishing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite may regard the fishing industry as a laughing matter, but I do not. I am trying to emphasise some of the things which should and must be done, and which will be attended to in order to improve our fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter is the scientific building of fishing boats. It is only during the last few years that stern fishing has been adopted. That, in itself, is a criticism of the inadequate way in which the need to build boats for the express purpose of fishing has been tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the protection of our fish markets. Even now those markets are not sufficiently protected, and I commend the Minister to give consideration to that aspect of the industry before long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Methods of diminishing the waste of young fish have been dealt with, but not adequately. Further work is required. We must also study the economics of the industry. It is only lately that the White Fish Authority has set up a fishery economic research unit to undertake research into the economics of the industry. This
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
work is being supplemented by university departments of economics, but it is very late in the day; it should have been done years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important aspect is the conservation of our diminishing fish resources in the North Sea, the North Atlantic and our traditional fishing grounds. Another is breeding of fish in inland lochs. Only yesterday I asked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland whether he was aware
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the developments and improvements in fish farming undertaken by the White Fish Authority in co-operation with the University of Strathclyde directed towards raising the temperature in the chosen experimental Scottish lochs and towards feeding the embryo fish in order to increase their size and vitamin content; and what assistance the Government is giving to these improvements and developments."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th July, 1965; Vol. 716, c. 470.]</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend told me in reply that some assistance is being given, and today the Minister of State said that this is only a beginning. It is a beginning which is too little and too late. My hon. Friend has said that it is a background. We want to bring the background into the foreground, and see that the matter is adequately attended to. Further, we want to bring it not only to the foreground but to the stomachs of the British people and into the pockets of the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport has been referred to by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East and my hon. Friend but, again, it is very late in the day. It is only very recently that the idea of co-ordinating road, rail and sea transport has been adumbrated in this connection, and even now it is only in its infancy. The Beeching controversy still drags on, and the problem of the co-ordination of the three forms of transport has not been completely solved. I recommend .the Minister to take some further steps in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are an island nation surrounded by seas of valuable fish—fish so valuable that we export it to Australia, to the Antipodes. Why is that? It is because the quality, the taste and the succulence of the fish derived from the North Sea are much superior to those of the fish caught in any other seas. That is why the Australians, the South Africans, the Indians and the South Americans buy
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
Aberdeen fish. It is superior to any other fish in the world. That fact has to be brought home to the people of the world. Indeed, it is brought home to the people of the world, and to their stomachs—much to their benefit. It is doing them a great deal of good. But even now the Scottish industry and the Scottish Office—leaving aside the shortcomings of the previous Administration—are not doing enough to publicise the importance of Scottish fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this opportunity to take part in the debate. I wish to refer particularly to fishing in the Highlands and Islands. We often find people referring to agriculture, forestry and fishing as the main traditional industries of the area, but, so far as I can trace, the only traditional industries of any size are agriculture and fishing. Forestry as we know it today is of comparatively recent origin. I can well remember the time when we had no Forestry Commission operating in the north of Scotland. Today, happily, it is making a very valuable contribution to the economy of certain parts of the Highlands and this contribution will increase in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, fishing was the main source of livelihood over a very large area of the Highlands and Islands. It is because fishing has gone down that a large part of the Highlands is now depopulated. I have been told by crofter fishermen that many years ago an acre of the sea was more valuable than an acre of land along the western seaboard and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was shocked to read in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 3rd July:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Firm line on Highlands. New board told to write off non-viable croft areas. The Highland Development Board, when it gets under way later this year, will be advised to face the facts and write off certain areas in the crofting counties that have no chance of being viable. Investment should be concentrated only on those districts which have some potential for growth. This was the feeling of the Government advisers when they discussed a draft of the Highland Survey at a meeting in Edinburgh on Thursday. I understand that, though the Report makes no specific recommendation, it suggests that the answer to the Highlands' problems lies in the further development of forestry and tourism."</p></blockquote>
I refuse to accept that view. If this is to be Government policy, it is most disappointing. To suggest that certain areas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
should be written off before the new Board is even set up, is surely quite contrary to the spirit of the Bill which we recently passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody is more ready than I am to admit the difficulties which will confront the Board when it is set up, but there will be many opportunities if the Board will only grasp them. One of these opportunities will be to revive the once flourishing fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, we welcome the recent extension of the fishing limits to 12 miles. This should prove to be a great benefit in future. With this increased extension of the fishing grounds, there should be an extension of the scheme for training crews, on the lines of the scheme operating successfully in the Western Isles. To this must be allied a scheme to provide grants to help the purchase of new boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the west and north-west coast, which the Minister knows well, we have good fishing ports such as Stornoway, Kyle, Gairloch, Ullapool, Lochinver and Kinlochbervie. But what do we find? Very few local fishermen. Some of these ports have as many as 30 boats or more fishing from them, but the crews go home by bus or private car at the weekend, some of them travelling for distances of 150 miles or more each way, which says a great deal for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a social problem of considerable importance. The new Highlands Board should arrange to build houses to attract some of these men to live nearer their work, bringing their families with them. If it did this, it would help to increase the number of children in the district and this increase in turn would help to solve the long-standing problem of justifying the provision of educational facilities up to school-leaving age, and this is even more important now that we are soon to increase the school-leaving age by a year. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, in reply to a Question in the House yesterday, his right hon. Friend referred to the difficulties facing local authorities and the Scottish Education Department in providing those facilities which are so essential. Here is a very good opportunity, because the only way in which to justify the provision of these additional facilities is to increase the number of pupils for whom education has to be provided.
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
The present setup whereby children in the sparsely populated districts in the north-west Highlands have to leave home at the age of 12 in order to be educated in the more densely populated districts on the east coast is a very serious problem for these communities. It has a discouraging and a depressing effect on both parents and pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More processing facilities ought to be provided at the main ports. This would help to give a more uniform price throughout and it would provide additional employment. It should also reduce transport charges, and this reduction, as we all realise, is vital to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, there have always been too much of the element of gambling in the fishing industry on the west coast. We must get rid of this if we are to attract the right types back. If there were a surplus of fish in the British Isles, one would hesitate to recommend further development, but statistics show that Britain's catch goes down annually and that we now stand twelfth among the fishing countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet we are importing salmon to the value of £30 million a year, so there can be no doubt about the market potential. Salmon fishing stations provide much needed employment in certain areas and could be greatly increased by better management, especially, for instance, in protection from grey seals which do a great deal of damage to salmon fisheries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the publicity given to the White Fish Authority and the Herring Industry Board, one tends to forget the importance of salmon fishing as an industry itself, because it is very specialised. The main thing is to produce a high quality product and to present it in a way which will appeal to the public. This is as true of our fish products as it is of our agricultural products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have referred to and have paid tribute to fishermen as a class, and I associate myself with those views. While I am essentially a man of the land, I have always had the very highest admiration for these brave, God-fearing men of the sea who earn their living in such hazardous conditions, and I am glad that conditions are now being made easier and safer for them. We are happy to say that we still have many of these fishermen left in our main
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
ports. We should stress that the contribution which they have made to the nation, especially during times of war and emergency, is out of all proportion to their numbers. This is one reason why, irrespective of politics, we should all see that something is done to maintain this noble race. It is not too late to ensure that it is done, provided that as a nation we have the will to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering future prospects, it is fair to make comparisons with other countries. Norway is a country smaller than ours in size and population and yet we have a good deal in common. In 1964, Norway exported fish and fish products to the value of £52 million. This is an object lesson to us and I hope that we shall take it. As has been shown by the figures which have been quoted, the number of fishing boats has declined rapidly over the past few years and time is running short. Now is the time to take bold and imaginative action to put this great industry on a sound footing and I hope that the Government will do everything to see that that is done. My party will certainly lend the Government all our support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) on his speech. The sincerity with which he always speaks is impressive, especially when allied with the good sense which he expressed today. My constituency shares many of the problems of Ross and Cromarty and Inverness-shire and the hon. Member and I therefore have many things which bring us together, sometimes across party frontiers. Admittedly, at other times we find ourselves in sharp conflict, not least when the Liberal Party takes part with the Tories in trying to destroy the very Labour Government at the very time when it is extremely important that the Labour Government's help is being demanded for the Highlands and Islands through the Highlands and Islands Development Board and otherwise. However, on this occasion I can agree with the hon. Gentleman and endorse much of what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address myself rather more narrowly to some of the problems of the Western Isles and I hope that the Minister will be able to give one or two replies
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
to some of the questions which have been awaiting answer for a long time. I do not, therefore, want to discuss fish farming on this occasion, but, to refresh the memory of the few remaining older Members, perhaps, I should mention that we in the Scottish Committees were discussing fish farming as far back as 1943, in the days of Tom Johnston. There was even a piece of Parliamentary doggerel, a couplet, which ran:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Fish large as whales by I.C.I, are caught In far Loch Sween for Scotland's Greatest Scot".</p></blockquote>
This was a reference to Tom Johnston's part in the promotion of schemes based on the activities of I.C.I, at Loch Sween.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what has happened to them, but at that time everybody thought that I.C.I, in the then very near future would have fish maturing to full size in a few months instead of a few years. This morning's references strike a note in the memory of many years ago—of 1942 or 1943. Yet now hon. Members are talking as though the present project was a new pioneering starting point. For all the work of I.C.I, and Government and others in research, little of practical note seems to have been achieved and in 1965 we seem to be starting almost from scratch again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

To come back to the Western Isles can the Minister now tell us what is happening about the final formalities about the pier at Loch Boisdane? This is a practical question not only for the island fishermen, but for the whole community of South Uist. A request for a statement by the Minister is not an unreasonable one, because this matter had been held up, awaiting decision month after month during the last years of the previous Government and during the last few months of the present Government. We have had to wait a very long time for a final Treasury clearance for a major extension and reconstruction and modernisation job on this pier, which is absolutely essential for all purposes connected with transport and communications and fisheries in the Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
I am particularly glad once again to commend the local district council, which is the proprietor of the pier and which has undertaken the considerable responsibility for the job. We know that this issue is now beyond the point of favourable decision at last; but cannot the decision now be made public? We are desperately anxious for this scheme to go ahead and get this pier under construction. I have written to my right hon. Friend again in the last day or two saying that it should not be necessary to have these very long waiting periods in such cases or have to ask this type of question being asked of him again after today. I hope that we shall have the final confirming statement today so that the local people and authority can be relieved of their remaining anxiety that any more unexpected snags can possibly arise. The Council knows, but not the rest of the local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is such a thing as economy by delay and the Treasury is extremely good at that sort of thing. The idea is that if something is put off for a few weeks, another whole year is gained without the expenditure and this is regarded as an economy. But it is not, for with increasing costs all the time, any economies which might be made are wiped out as we go along. It is time to realise that economy by delay does not pay. I hope that the council in South Uist has been finally told that the pier is to be given the go ahead beyond any possible last minute snags. They and I have been extremely forbearing and patient about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromerty mentioned the problem of transport and also of travel and housing facing fishermen in some areas. I myself am in great difficulty here. The Outer Islands Fishery Training Scheme is a credit to everyone concerned. It is a credit to the Department and to the co-operation and diligence it has shown in helping to make a success of the scheme. It is a credit to the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) for helping to make a reality of it and I pay my tribute to him. It is a great credit to the fishermen concerned in the Western Isles, and to the East coast crews who, in the best possible spirit of co-operation, helped train the crews. The scheme is an excellent example of how
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
one can make a success out of a co-operative effort of this kind, calling upon the skill and the willingness and enterprise of local people, with assistance from the right Departmental and other official quarters and the provision of the capital necessary from elsewhere because of the lack of local capital, thus enabling the local people to take on their part of the burden of purchasing the new vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the power of the Minister of State is limited in this regard but I hope that he will look at the question of the rates of interest being charged in the case of men taking on the heavy loan burden on new boats. It is asking a bit too much that they should have to bear almost from the outset the full burden of very high rates of interest at a time when more prosperous and powerful industries and others interests of all kinds are receiving immense subsidies and subventions from the public purse. I cannot see why we are not able to give, at least, concessionary rates of repayment and interest to men who are anxious to assist in every way to make a success of this fine experiment. I should, indeed, not use the word "experiment" because the scheme has been in many ways a general success. Although there are spots in it which have created difficulties, and still do, nevertheless it has been such a success that there are men now waiting in the Islands to form crews and to extend the new fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the time is now overdue for substantially extending the fleet and for training crews and generally increasing the activities of the fishing industry in the Islands. This is the time for it. The spirit is there and there is the feeling and taste of success. The boats in general have been doing well. Those men who have come in are anxious to stay and new crews are waiting. This is the time to encourage them. Let us not go on talking of consolidating the experiment and observing it. Let us extend the new fleet now because the men are ready and willing and so far the scheme has been successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of outstanding problems in the industry along the northwest coast and in the Islands. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty touched on one which concerned the men in the Outer Islands Fishery Training Scheme as well as their families. I have had correspondence from men working in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
scheme who want to get away from their villages to the nearest town, to Stomoway, to live, bringing their children to the central school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find my loyalties divided on this. I may be right or wrong but I do not like to see over-centralisation or any further contribution to depopulating our villages if we can avoid it by assisting them by public or other means to stay in their present communities. At the same time, it is natural that the men whom we ask to take up dual purpose fishing and to fish all the year round should want to live in well equipped ports and be more in touch with their families in a larger community, when running these larger new vessels. It is natural that they should want to go to Stornoway, where their vessels are based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the question of housing. My hon. Friend should consider this point. It is largely a local authority matter but it would be worth while for him to try to assess the strength of demand for fishermen's houses in Stornoway from among the members of the crews of the new vessels in the Outer Islands Training Scheme. As I say, I am divided in my view. Of course they should be given the right to live where they want to—for instance, near a harbour where their vessels have to be based and to be serviced—but one does not want to see our villages depopulated. We are caught between two problems; but the men have a right to a choice and housing is vital in this choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps my hon. Friend will be able to tell me what is happening on the island of Eriskay regarding its jetty and completion of that road. Certainly, little appears to be happening at the moment so perhaps we might be able to stir it up a little. Perhaps my hon. Friend will ask Lord Hughes to say something about it by letter, even this afternoon. I do not expect an answer now. I have waited many years and my expectations shrink of early replies and immediate action. But I do not know how many years of argument there have been about the proposal for a jetty at Eriskay and about the completion of the Eriskay road. It is high time we had the final answer. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) when in office did his best for
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
the Eonigarry jetty in Barra. But it is still only being considered. Has any final decision been taken yet on the jetty, so essential to fishing and communications and transport, on that island. Perhaps Lord Hughes will give the answer today or very soon?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened to the proposal for a vehicle ferry between the island of Berneray and North Uist—a project which is of the greatest importance to local people? They have abandoned the idea of a bridge or causeway to North Uist; but a vehicular ferry service is wholly practicable and feasible and equally essential. There is the vehicle ferry at Scalpay, in Harris, which can provide what is, in effect, a bridge three or four times or oftener a day. That is all they are seeking for Berneray to North Uist. They do not ask for special treatment or public doles. They merely want some help in modernising local transport arrangements. I hope that my hon. Friend will have an answer about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Government are faced with quite a number of such proposals in the Hebridean Islands. There have been requests from the fishermen in the island of Bernera, Lewis—at Croir. What are the possibilities of the provision of an adequate fishing and transport jetty there, where it is essential?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from deploring these requests as placing new burdens on the Exchequer we—especially those hon. Members from the Islands and Highlands—should welcome every sign of interest in new jetties, new roads, new boats. These are signs of life, of progress. But the local people get so fed up with waiting for years for decisions at even the smallest level—often waiting for,years for a decision, for example, on such a little matter as the Eriskay jetty. That is something that has been before the Government and the Treasury for twenty years or so. It is absurd to take such a long time for decisions and action on such minor, essential schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An hon. Member talked of the only modified success of the new fishery limit. I very much welcomed the action taken in connection with the limit in the last Parliament. It was overdue. Now we are at the stage when not only must our national fishery interests be served and fish stocks conserved, but when we must also consider the possibility of conserving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
and developing stocks on a local or regional area basis as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worth while, as I suggested at the time of the Neven-Spence Committee in 1945, reserving certain areas for the use of the local fishing communities while building up and modernising the local fishing fleets and bringing in new boats and blood locally into the industry. At the same time I recognise that there would have to be some limitation in the area on a regional basis in relation to the catch and overall landings in the ports of the area concerned. This is something that we shall have to consider as an addition to national fishery conservation and to the more real international conservation which must come. We shall have to consider local conservation and reservation of fishing rights with a view to the extension of the fishing industries within their own localities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I only wish the Scottish and British public in general were as interested in the industry and its welfare as hon. Members representing fishing areas. We feel strongly about the problem because we live with it and are identified with the people who man the boats and are allied to the industry. The trouble is that so many people who are so patriotic about Scotland in general and so anxious to put it on the map are not prepared to put it on the map in terms of eating a herring or a good haddock once a week or day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It used to be said that if the million or so persons who signed the Scottish Covenant some years ago had pledged themselves to eat a herring once a week throughout the season the industry would have flourished. It would have been practical patriotism. Meantime, the Government could do something by considering enforcement of the clear labelling of fish in shops, so that housewives would know what they were buying. I am sure that some younger housewives do not know a ling from a lobster or a sardine from a shark fillet. They see all sorts of fish on the slab without identification and it is time that the Government got down to the enforcement of the compulsory labelling of fish by shopkeepers—as well as prices. I hope that more will be done to teach housewives, and, in particular, English housewives—for they form the bigger market—how to select and cook fish. It is also import-

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a very interesting suggestion, that certain local waters should be reserved. In other words, he was referring to the fishing limit. I hope that the hon. Member the Minister of State will give us the Government's considered view. I do not know to what extent the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) is in the confidence of the Government, but he made a major statement of policy when he said that the Government were doing a great deal about considering a further expansion of fishing limits. As this is of major concern to the Scottish fishing industry, I hope that the Minister of State will tell us whether this is so, and how many miles they expect to extend the limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I should like to join those who have congratulated my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) on the ability and energy with which he opened the debate. He covered many subjects which are of concern to us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not think that the Minister of State really replied to my hon. Friend on a local matter concerning my constituency, and in the few minutes during which he will reply, I should like him to give us a progress report on what is happening between his Department, the Town Council, and the Harbour Board

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like the Minister of State to explain a figure which I think is of considerable interest. Appendix II on page 21 of the White Fish Authority's Report contains some interesting figures about the catches of the inner and middle waters. They are of particular concern to Aberdeen. The figures are related to the English figures. In 1964, the total catch for the inner and middle waters of England and Wales was 113,982 tons. The Scottish catch was almost the same, namely, 112,442 tons, but the value of the English catch was £11½ million, in round figures, while that of the Scottish catch was only £7½ million. Very high quality fish are caught in the inner and middle waters of Scotland. These obtain high prices, and I think that this great discrepancy between £7½ million and £11½ million deserves an explanation, when the weight of the catch is almost the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short time available to me I shall not venture into the controversy over the cut in the subsidies because we shall have another opportunity to discuss this on the Floor of the House, but I think that in this debate it is worth while drawing attention to paragraph 13 of the Authority's Report in which it points out that in considering this question of finance one should not pay too much attention to the peaks and the troughs of financial returns according to the catches in each year otherwise it will never be possible, with a general level of subsidy, to get down to a rational reorganisation which in some ports is still necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke of certain divisions within the fishing industry, and, of course, he is right. There are divisions between certain sections and, alas, between both the English and Scottish sections of the fishing industry. I thought that the Authority's Report put it all rather tactfully when, talking about the difficulty of getting agreement, it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The industry's traditional self-reliance operates even more vigorously when times improve and the basic need for action is often
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
obscured by financial returns which are better, albeit temporarily."</p></blockquote>
Although, as the Minister of State said, this has been a prosperous year, and certainly much better than it was thought it would be following the extension of the Faroe limits, I think that we have a right to a more considered statement from the Minister as to whether the Government really think that the subsidies should taper off completely in 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, can the Minister give us a more definite progress report about the minimum prices scheme? After all, discussions started in July, 1964. I noticed that the Minister did not actually use the words "the matter is still under review". He used a phrase peculiar to himself, namely, "that the matter is being pursued". Whether it is being pursued, or is under review, I think that in a debate on fishing we are entitled to a more detailed description from the Minister of what the difficulties are, and when he expects to report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I must now sit down to give way to those who are to speak from the Front Benches I conclude by saying that I hope the Minister will return to his freer form of action and speech, because I think that we get more information that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is so often the case in this Committee we have had an interesting and broadly informed debate. I should like, as other hon. Members on both sides have done, to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) on his very good speech, a very clear and sincere speech. It was also a pleasure to the Committee to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) keeping up the traditions of his predecessor and talking with skill and knowledge about the problems of fishing in his area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also heard a speech by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie). I agreed broadly with a great deal of what he said. I would merely like to say to him that, with regard to the figure which he quoted for exports of fish from Norway, which he seemed to be holding up as a very good example for Scotland as a small country, that I rather suspect that if we took the value of the fish we send across the Border to England we should find
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
that we were doing about as well as Norway appears to be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very grateful to the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) for having said some kind words about the scheme which I helped to start for training crews, and also for some kind words about the fishery limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem which faces Scotland, and, to a great extent, Britain as a whole, in thinking about the future of the fishing industry, is its cyclical nature and the ability it has often completely to throw into confusion those prophets who make the most careful analysis of the future. It is only necessary for somebody from St. Andrew's House, or Tory research, or the Front Bench, to state firmly that certain things will happen in the fishing industry in the next year or two for exactly the opposite to happen. It is, therefore, a difficult problem, and when the Minister, talking about the problem of conservation, said that it was unrealistic to expect rapid progress, I fully appreciated what he meant—and, of course, we do not expect very rapid progress in many fields from the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a genuine problem on the question of viability. I think we all accept that the Fleck Report, which was based on the best information which was then available, and which, as the hon. Gentleman said, both sides of the House broadly accepted, may need looking at again in the light of conditions which have changed considerably, in some ways for the better, in some ways not, since that Report was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in the last year or two our Scottish returns have been helped almost equally by two things. One was the extra haddock broods which—in this case—were forecast with great accuracy by the Scottish Department. The second one, I think almost equally important, has been the shortage of meat available from abroad, the rising price of meat has led fish as as whole to rise in price, and has brought better returns to the fishermen, even though they were not, in all cases, catching more fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position which I should like to take on the question of these cuts to which the Minister and other hon. Members referred is simply this, that we can debate in United Kingdom terms and in Scottish terms the Tightness or wrong-
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
ness of making these cuts. Personally, I think that in Scotland, where the great bulk of the inshore fishing is done, and where its importance is often in small individual cases—we do not have great ports like Aberdeen and Fraserburgh in the west; we have many small ones—it would be a pity if the Government felt that they had to cut the subsidies to these people, in this year in particular. But if they did so feel, if they think that they have to take the money out because the fishing industry has done better this year, then I think they should be prepared to come to the House or this Committee and say, "The money which we are saving we are putting back into the industry"—in some shape or form; because to my mind the future possibility of success for the industry, whether the inshore, or whether the near and middle distance fleets which operate from Aberdeen, or the distant water trawlers, lies very largely in two or three special directions, all of which need some attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these has been mentioned today, the wharves and the piers. It may well be that we do not need a greater number of boats catching, but if their catch is to be landed efficiently, handled efficiently, and got to market efficiently, then where there are problems of wharves and piers certainly there is room for extra money to be spent. My hon. Friends from Aberdeen have talked about the state of the wharves there. I am sure each one of us knows of particular cases in his constituency. I have a small flourishing fishing industry at Carradale which has been helped by the Government in the past. I know that it is in the queue and that by its efforts it has done a lot to deserve help. There is a possible way of spending money for the long-term good of the industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable opportunities for spending money on marketing and research. I think that the White Fish Authority itself has pointed out in reports, and in discussions which we have had with it, that one of the main difficulties is getting the quality fish which is caught into the market and into the household in good order. This is not in any way helped by the extremely antiquated conditions of a good many of the markets, or by some of the rather antiquated ideas of some of the people who handle and process the fish. I believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
this is a way in which the problem raised by my noble Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir), about the return for the fish caught, could be tackled. I know that there are specific problems there. The quality is very good, but the fish are rather small, and it has been my experience, from looking at reports, that fish prices in Aberdeen have been lower than those who admire Aberdeen, even if we do not come from it, would like them to be. I believe that it is possible to improve the position by introducing modern techniques for handling and processing the fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the research side there is certainly a great deal to be done and I suspect that there always will be. As soon as one problem is solved, one has to deal with the next. I think that it was the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) who talked about stern trawling. It is surprising in a way how little real research is done in this country into the shape and nature of trawls themselves. I am told that a certain amount of work is being done on this subject in Japan, and I shall, if I can, find out what information they are producing, because the whole problem of catching fish can depend very considerably on the shape and size of the trawl.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have not thought of ways and means to spend the extra money which they are getting back from the fishing industry—if I can put it that way—by these subsidy cuts which they are proposing, then if they will find some ways in these two or three directions, of putting the money back into the industry the House will be pleased, because one of the things which has struck all of us in the last eight months has been the very steady increase in costs which have come largely, if not entirely, direct through the action of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had complaints, on transport costs and the enormous rises which have been demanded by British Railways, from some of our coastal areas. These, I hope, have been fully taken into consideration by the Minister in trying to assess the profitability of the industry next year. Of course, a great many of those areas where fish is caught have no rail at all, and there journeys have to be long and
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
by lorry, along sometimes rather narrow roads. Here, this cost has been greatly increased by the extra tax on petrol. So that the Government, as well as cutting the subsidies, have directly added very considerable extra costs for these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have spoken of the success of the shell fish industry and the increased amounts of money which have come into the inshore fishing fleets through scampi, lobsters, crabs, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman talked about the great increase in the cost of transport. Can he tell us just exactly how much the increase in the petrol tax means per lb. on a five-ton load of fish? I think he must be exaggerating when he says there are very big increases in costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot, I am afraid, off the cuff. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman has knowledge of these things. Everybody who works and lives in the Highlands, with those very long distances, realises what a great extra cost this petrol tax has caused to these people. Sixpence extra on the gallon is about 12½ per cent. Many gallons of petrol and diesel oil are used by the fishing industry, and of course everything the fishermen needs—ropes, nets and so on—must be delivered to them by lorry if there is no railhead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give way, but I have promised the Minister to sit down in half a minute. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, and I will just finish what I wanted to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister of State, as nearly always happens in these debates, is left with many questions to answer but with very little time. I hope that, if he cannot answer all the questions, he will at least try to confirm the hope which the whole Committee has, that the Government are not merely saving money on the fishing industry but that they have constructive plans for spending more money where it is necessary to make the industry viable in the long-term and to improve marketing, handling and research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman says, I have many questions to answer in a short time. I will first answer a ques-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>315</span>
tion asked by the noble Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) about Aberdeen harbour, but I am afraid that the answer will not be much different from the previous one. As I tried to make clear earlier, this is essentially a matter for the Aberdeen Harbour Board and the town council. I said that previously. The Harbour Board was told some time ago that, if it wished to seek Exchequer assistance, it would have to present a full case. I understand that the Board has been discussing with the town council the question of taking over the fish market from the council but that these negotiations have not been successfully concluded. We are keeping in touch with the situation to see what can be done to speed it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lady also asked about the difference in prices and quoted figures. I am informed that the reason for it is that in England near water catch consists largely of fiat fish which are more valuable per cwt. than the round fish—cod, haddock, etc.—which make up the bulk of the Scottish catch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lady wanted another statement about a minimum price scheme. I have nothing to add to what I said in the first place. The matter is being pursued and as soon as it is possible to make a statement the Government will make that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) raised questions, many of which were rather fringe questions in relation of fishing. Perhaps I can give him one or two answers, if not all. In relation to Lochboisdale, I take it that my hon. Friend was referring to the transport pier there. I understand that the extension to the existing pier has been approved and an offer of grant and loan assistance has been accepted by the district council. The work is expected to start within the next month or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also spoke about the training scheme in the Outer Hebrides and remarked upon what a success this has been, which is very true. He asked whether it could be extended. This was a point which was made to me very forcibly when I was in the area recently. The White Fish Authority has agreed to consider applications for assistance for purchasing boats from suitable applicants in the Islands, while the Highland Fund
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
has also agreed to try to help with the provision of deposits on more boats. In effect, these arrangements mean that assistance will still be available to men in the Islands for boats and gear on the same terms as they were available under the earlier arrangements. That is the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was raised whether this particular scheme should be adopted elsewhere. I think that the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) suggested this. We have not yet been convinced that it would be successful to start this scheme elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is successful in the Western Islands. Does not my hon. Friend feel that under the same auspices, with the same people behind it and co-operating, this is the right basis on which to extend it? Is there any reason why we should not have a commitment that there should be an extension on exactly the same basis as the basis of the previous success? We are anxious that the Department should be fully in this from beginning to end; this is the local feeling. The auspices were excellent before. It is rather a pity that we should go over to any sort of patchwork arrangement for a future extension, if any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In practice, if there is the the demand for the boats and the possibility that the fleet can be built up, it can be done in the way I have suggested that it should be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State mentioned the Highland Fund helping. If the Fund advances some of the deposit, does this make any difference to the White Fish Authority's guaranteeing things?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I understand not. It is really additional help to the men in the Western Isles if they wish to build up on what has already been done there and what has already proved to be very successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised a number of other points. I think that most of them were rather fringe points. A number of them are at present before my noble Friend who is in charge of the department concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->

raised by his hon. Friend, he will recall that his hon. Friend asked whether the Government would agree to reserving certain areas. The hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) said that the Government were considering extending the fishing limits. I wonder whether the Minister of State can answer that, because it is a question of fundamental importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I know, the Government do not intend to make any change. Changes have been made and they have been announced. That is the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Baker) raised a number of points and made a number of interesting suggestions in what was a very interesting speech. We will look into the various suggestions that he has made. One of them concerned subsidies. He suggested that subsidies should not have been reduced, in view of the increased costs. He asked us to bear in mind the question of increased costs. The increased costs are shown in the returns upon which the examination of the industry is based. This is how it operates. Therefore account is taken of increased costs. It is upon the returns which are gathered from this that the final assessment as to the extent of the subsidies is made.

The business of the limit and the Moray Firth is always under consideration, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Most of the points which he raised in connection with it are always being considered. The prohibition of seine netting—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The noble Lady and hon. Gentlemen should grow up. They are behaving like a bunch of children.
