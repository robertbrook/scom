	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what was said last Thursday, it would be useful if the Minister could now make a statement of staffing matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), who raised several issues concerning the staffing and resources of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. His worry stemmed from a letter from the secretary of the Nature Conservancy Council's trade union side to the Minister for the Environment and Countryside in the Department of the Environment. The hon. Gentleman read out several extracts from that letter. With your agreement, Mr. Martin, I should like to respond to the hon. Gentleman on those points that are relevant to our consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's worries relate to three main factors. The first is the level of staffing and funding for the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland, as a predecessor of Scottish Natural Heritage. The second factor is the number of extra scientists and the extra benefits in scientific terms that will accrue. The third concerns a number of issues about setting budgets for the new conservation agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to your views, Mr. Martin, I suggest that the third matter is not of direct relevance to the schedule. However, I accept that the establishment of the staffing levels for the NCC is of some relevance to SNH, and in giving background on that, I hope that I may allay some of the hon. Gentleman's anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All attempts, whether by the Scottish Office or the NCC, to calculate a reasonable basis for the staffing and funding levels of the three new bodies were hindered by the simple fact that the NCC accounting system cannot attribute indirect spending, such as on central services such as scientists, to different regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may recall that the letter quoted by the hon. Member for Linlithgow referred to a consultancy by PE Inbucon. That consultancy was carried out for and on behalf of the NCC to estimate
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
the level of funding necessary for the three new bodies. As noted in the letter and confirmed by the hon. Gentleman on 21 February,
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a difference of opinion about the matter."—
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 21 February 1991, c.72.]</p></blockquote>
The scope for interpretation of the analysis is considerable given that the NCC could not attribute costs directly and has several elements of expenditure that can vary considerably from year to year and from area to area—examples include casual and temporary staff, and management agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Scotland, we can be a little more definite. The best estimate for the final year of the NCC operation is that £7.4 million will be spent directly and that between £2 million and £3 million could be attributed to Scotland. Those rough estimates give a total spend of about £10 million for 1990–91. The number of the NCC staff based in Scotland is about 245. For 1991–92 the NCC will have a budget of nearly £19 million and a staff complement of 385. The NCC expects to have 70 per cent of its staff in post by 1 April and to have reached 90 per cent by June. By any standards, that represents a significant increase in both resources and staffing in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The analysis to assess the required level of staffing and resources in Scotland was carried out jointly by officials of the Scottish Office Environmental Department and the Nature Conservancy Council Scottish directorate. Both the complement and the budget have been accepted by Mr. Magnusson and his board as sufficient for the tasks they face in the NCC's proposed one year of operation. I emphasise that our aim has always been that the NCCS should do more than the present NCC in Scotland, especially in relation to improving understanding of and changing attitudes about nature conservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we may be absolutely clear, will the Minister confirm whether Mr. Magnusson has agreed to the budget for doing what he considers should be done about conservation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, Mr. Magnusson has no doubts whatever that he has been given sufficient funds not only to carry out improvements but to maintain present services. Does the hon. Gentleman assent to that proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am glad to confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the hon. Gentleman's second point about the number of scientists in the NCCS I first remind him that the NCC has, and NCCS will have, a significant number of scientifically qualified staff. The figure of 30 that I gave the hon. Gentleman in the previous sitting refers only to those scientists engaged directly in research activities. They are those most closely related to the former chief scientist directorate in Peterborough to which he referred. I confirm that there will be 30 specialist scientists available to carry out, commission and supervise research. Those posts are new to Scotland. More
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
important, they will ensure that the benefits of the research are readily available to the regional and local officers who will deal directly with the public, landowners and occupiers. They will have quicker and more direct access to research than was possible under the previous arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman specifically asked about extra benefits in scientific terms. I am sure that he will appreciate that those are not quantifiable, but I hope that my explanation gives him some assurance on that matter. I can also assure him that the new arrangements will not result in the triplication of services in each country. The specialisms in the NCCS will be those most relevant to nature conservation in Scotland. The mix of specialisms in the English and Welsh bodies will similarly reflect their needs. There may be some overlaps, for example in upland ecology, but these reflect common interests and concerns. The liaison arrangements will ensure that each body has access to all relevant skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have helped to clarify the position on the staffing and funding levels for the NCCS and, more important, the way in which those important factors were determined. I have not gone into detail on the calculations of resources for the other conservation bodies as that is not appropriate to the consideration of schedule 1. Moreover, it would involve us in arguments about the interpretation of matters of fine detail that are now a matter of record. The hon. Member for Linlithgow rightly noted the difference of interpretation and presumably has the other letters exchanged between the NCCS trade union side and Ministers in the Department of the Environment. If he has remaining doubts or concerns, he should take the matter up with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Committee that we made a careful assessment of the increased resources necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of service in Scotland for nature conservation and that we have provided the necessary staffing and resources to the NCCS to put that into effect. SNH will inherit both those resources and those of the Countryside Commission for Scotland. We shall also consider in the next public expenditure round whether any additional resources should be allocated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has given a serious and courteous reply, over which he and his advisers have taken some trouble. I do not want to prolong the debate by nit-picking, as the Committee wants to proceed. As the Minister referred to the former chief scientist in Peterborough, I shall give him—as soon as I can make the copying machine outside work—a four-page typescript letter of 18 February from Dr. Derek Ratcliffe which outlines some of his anxieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>GENERAL FUNCTIONS OF SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 5, after "Scotland", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"including sites to be designated as National Parks.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would invest SNH with the power to bring forward areas for designation as national parks. When the Bill was first mooted in the heady days of the late 1980s, it was considered that it might include the necessary provisions to introduce some form of management for Scottish upland areas. The Opposition and many other people are disappointed that the Bill does not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A generous interpretation is that the matter is still out for consultation and that the final policy has not yet been formulated. As the Countryside Commission did not report until September 1990, the Minister may have received only recently the result of its consultations, which are still being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The less generous interpretation is that there is a lack of political will to get the Bill onto the statute book. It is a controversial issue and it will require some bold political decisions. Given the current state of the Tory party in Scotland and the effects of previous Scottish legislation, the Government are not prepared to create controversy by making those difficult decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition accept in principle, but with some reservations, the need for some arrangement to manage upland areas, including national parks. We give that our qualified support. The Countryside Commission report deals not only with national parks, but with the management of all upland areas and it considers indicative strategies as methods of management. It also deals with land management forums for the various land management areas. It selects four areas, which we shall consider when appropriate, for designation as national parks that will require special attention and special management arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The name "national park" is not the most appropriate. Unfortunately, it is good shorthand. Everyone talks about national parks, but the vibes are wrong. What is in a name? It seems that everything is wrong in this case. In many people's minds the name is a token of bureaucracy—turnstiles, gates, impaired access, swings, roundabouts, picnic places, ma, pa and the wains. Everyone and everything is wrong with it. We should seriously consider changing the name. The only good thing I have to say about the proposed natural heritage areas is that they have a better name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no blanket solution for national parks. What is needed for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs is obviously not appropriate for Wester Ross, the Fannichs and the surrounding areas. The number of people, their forms of recreation, the form of the land and its fauna are different. The whole culture is different. To impose a blanket solution
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
would be improper. Indeed, the Countryside Commission makes separate arrangements for Wester Ross. I do not want to comment unnecessarily on the rights and wrongs of such arrangements at this stage, but we should not permit a blanket solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the method of management, it must involve the local people and their elected representatives. Not under any circumstances should one take an area away from its local community and try to impose management from outside. Unless the local people living in local housing, the shopkeepers, the landowners, the fish-farmers and whoever else are intimately involved with a powerful voice—not a perfunctory talking-shop voice, but a real voice— such arrangements will never work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those areas must also be adequately funded. That is a problem with the natural heritage areas that the Minister intends to introduce in a later amendment. It is a pity that we cannot discuss it now. For example, the Peak district receives £2.4 million in Government grants and the Lake district receives £1.7 million. Unless we are prepared to invest money, natural heritage areas will not work. For example, including Loch Lomond and the Trossachs in the regional parks system has been a good effort, but it has fallen down because of inadequate funding to protect and control the various areas within it. Finally, as well as ensuring the conservation of an area and its natural heritage, the national parks must ensure access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the concept of national parks for many of the reasons outlined in the Countryside Commission report. I do not want to go into all of them, but they relate to mountain areas with tremendous scenery, great recreational opportunities, natural history and cultural history. Those areas are worth preserving, but we have failed to protect them. The planning to deal with changes resulting from forestry and fish-farming has been poor. When one listens to complaints about those areas, forestry is mentioned constantly. I am aware of the new indicative strategies that have been formed, but they remain a bone of contention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is poor development in some areas and the Countryside Commission provides us with a classic example of one which is not within a national park, but in the uplands. Anyone who passes through Tyndrum and sees the Little Chef just before the Oban turn-off—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 
	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State has perked up. I believe that Tyndrum is in his constituency. That development is most inappropriate, as I am sure that he will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are areas where developments must be carried out sensitively, but that has not always been the case. The wild, remote land is under threat and tracks are bulldozed through it with little attention to its overall nature and cultural future. The Countryside Commission was correct to identify certain areas and it may be worth discussing briefly
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
each of the four places which it has mentioned to determine whether they should be included and whether others should be added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that all hon. Members agree that it is essential that Loch Lomond should be included as a national park. It is probably under the heaviest pressure from visitors, which will greatly increase when the A74 finally becomes the M74. The loch, the surrounding countryside and the Lomond mountains are already under threat. Although the regional park authorities have tried their best, they have failed to solve all of the problems, so that area must be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cairngorms is an area of arctic tundra, permafrost, and great natural history and beauty. Because it is easy to gain access to it through the ski road and so on, it, too, is under great pressure. The Cairngorms region is of world importance and it certainly must be preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ben Nevis and Glencoe are two important areas. Glencoe may be subjected to less pressure because it is run by the National Trust under Percy Una's rules and is protected to a certain extent. However, it has not solved all of that area's problems, which shows that national bodies cannot always protect such places. Anyone who sees the National Trust car park there knows what an eyesore it is and those who view the areas from high up in the mountains realise that other arrangements are required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area at Clachaig is under great threat from insensitive development within it. Although Glencoe is fairly well protected and has been well looked after by the National Trust, we cannot neglect it. The area up the glen in the Ben Nevis range is threatened by the pressure of visitors and insensitive development all the way up to the youth hostel and beyond. There are now restrictions on wild camping in the glen, but something needs to be done about the path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am less committed to the concept of a national park for Wester Ross and I note that it probably encounters the greatest local opposition. The area already has a nature conservancy council and sites of special scientific interest around the Beinn Eighe nature reserve, but it is under less pressure from visitors. I know that we must anticipate that visitors may impose greater pressure in future, but that place is remote and only a few sites aroung Tyndrum are affected. Some of the developments, such as that at Beinn Damh, are like Byers road on a Friday night and most inappropriate in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that one area is missing—the Cullins and large parts of Skye. I do not suggest that that should be a national park, but the area might have been given more consideration. I am glad that Knoydart has not been included. It is a great wilderness and is well protected. No one goes there and it does not require special arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An argument against national parks is that such matters should be left to the locals, who know best. However, some areas are of such national importance and of such benefit to the whole nation that the nation must take over part of their management. The locals should not be excluded, because without their involvement and influence over matters, failure will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
ensue. Nothing should be imposed from outside, but the nation has a duty to protect certain areas for the benefit of everyone. The claim that the locals know best is discredited by areas such as Aviemore, where the strip development along the Aviemore peak leaves much to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the local oppositon is contained in the response of the Countryside Commission. The CCS would probably agree that the initial opposition was due to bad public relations and poor presentation on its part. It did not explain what was involved and the benefits that would follow. The CCS did not make it clear that for the locals the situation would not change and that it was trying to establish those areas for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further opposition came from the sterilisers, as I call them. That is highlighted by an article in 
	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> on Monday of last week, which argued that we had failed Loch Lomondside and that the solution was virtually to ban people from the area by closing the road at Balmaha. Anyone who advocates that solution should not be taken seriously. It would restrict access to Ben Lomond, which is an area of great benefit to all people in the central belt. It is a mountain that can easily be climbed of an evening from the central belt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>[Interruption]</i></p>

	<p>The Minister doubts that. Not only can one climb the mountain, but one can get back down in time for a glass of orange juice and lemonade at one of the local hostelries.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly fitter than I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I am fitter than he is. At one time I was, but not any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local people are justifiably worried that they will lose authority—for example, planning authority in villages such as Braemar and Aviemore. That is a genuine complaint and should be dealt with. In the areas to be designated national parks—a term I dislike, but which I use as shorthand—the authority for planning in villages should be returned to the local authority under guidelines laid down for the national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another objection is based on the honeypot effect. As soon as an area is designated a special area, large numbers of people congregate there. That aspect is over-stressed. The increase in numbers visiting the Lake district national park, for example, has been because roads have recently opened to allow access from the motorways. If we developed the A9, more people would go to the Cairngorms and the pass. That, rather than mere designation, determines access to an area. Although that objection is arguable, it is less valid than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition give qualified support to the concept of national parks. We are disappointed that the Minister has not introduced legislation on national parks in the Bill. We look to him for a commitment to the concept of national parks, beyond
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
his concept of natural heritage areas. He will say that natural heritage areas are not supposed to supercede national parks, but I have read his consultation document on natural heritage areas and they really do supercede national parks. He is proposing national parks without funding. The Government are trying to introduce national parks without providing money for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation documents for natural heritage areas propose land management forums on a grand scale. The Minister contends that they will exist in addition to national parks. That is ridiculous. The Cairngorms will be a national park with another land management forum operating within it. That will be a great bureaucratic catastrophe. Furthermore, this will be handed down from the top. I have stressed that solutions for these areas should not be handed down from the top to the locals, yet that is what will happen with natural heritage areas. There will be talking shops within land management forums, and the heritage areas will have a secretariat and be run from SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to think again about natural heritage areas. We cannot have land management forums within national parks, especially if money is handed out. Large sums are involved for national parks, which are extensive areas. The Cairngorms will stretch from Braemar to Aviemore and down to Dalwhinnie. That is a huge area. We are not discussing land management grants of a few thousand pounds for small sites of scientific interest. We are not even discussing giving Lord Thurso £400,000 not to plant trees in areas where he never intended to plant them. We are discussing vast areas from the Aonachs and Glen Nevis, to Glencoe, the Black Mount, and over to Rannoch. Vast sums are involved and democratic accountability is needed. A natural heritage area, which is merely a land management forum within a national park, will be undemocratic and a bureaucratic disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter. It would be best if he did not table his amendment, but left the whole issue of national parks to be discussed further. I hope that he will give a commitment about the high mountain areas, along the lines of designating national parks, as proposed by the CCS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made a constructive and thoughtful speech. He made his judgment and decided to give national parks a cautious welcome. It will not surprise him to hear that I have come down on the other side of the fence, though not through hostility. I, too, have a great love of Scotland's mountain countryside areas. We are fortunate to have thousands of square miles of what can best be described as wilderness. Those of us who enjoy walking and indulging in other pursuits in the countryside know how fortunate we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the A9 and access to these areas. I must declare an interest, because the proposals impinge substantially on my constituency. Areas such as Rannoch, Drumochter, Glen Prosen,

	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
Glen Lyon and Glen Shee are beautiful. I could make a long list of the many beautiful glens in my constituency. It is interesting that the lines drawn on the map are like those drawn long ago, when the highlands and islands were said to be somewhere north of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried because some large areas will be designated, but similar areas will be omitted. It is assumed that by designating an areas as a national park, a solution will be found, as if by magic, and problems that exist in specific areas will be resolved. I do not believe that that is the right way to approach the matter. I am convinced by the people who live and work in, and who love the countryside. I accept that there are some who do not take care of the things that they have, but that is true in every walk of life—not just in matters of the countryside. The vast majority care deeply about the areas in which they work and live.

It is wrong to try to find such solutions for Scotland. The Border area and the highlands are the great heritage that we are fortunate enough to have. I see Scotland as a hugh natural area of recreation and leisure. Areas in the central belt that were devastated and scarred by the industrial revolution are now being developed for leisure and recreation and people are encouraged to make use of the available facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come down on the other side of the argument. I believe that the farmers, landowners and those who run the recreational facilities in the huge wilderness areas of Scotland are the people who should put right problems if they arise. I accept the point about car parks, but such decisions are made by elected local officials—those who run the councils. If we are saying that we need something over and above to second guess those who have been elected to take those decisions, we shall reach a point when the only reasonable body to second guess will be Parliament, which will have to take all the decisions. Parliament properly delegates and designates responsibility to others and allows them to get on with it. We do not expect people not to make mistakes. However, when councils have made mistakes, we expect them not to repeat them. If they do, and they continue to be elected, we can only assume that those who depend on the area for their well being support their local councils.

I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will realise that CCS has only just produced its conclusions on the matter, and we have all had the opportunity to study them. I hope that the Government will not make a precipitous judgment on something that arrived only a few hours ago, and that my hon. Friend will listen carefully to the views of those who live and work in those areas.

The CCS is based in my constituency and I know the chairman and its members well. However, I am on the other side of the fence. I believe, in common with the hon.

Gentleman has come down on one side and has given the proposal a cautious welcome, but I take the opposite view as I do not

If national parks are to be introduced, I would support the amendment, but, like the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), although I care deeply about our natural heritage and mountain areas, I, too, am against the idea of national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine the history of national parks. I believe that William Wordsworth introduced the notion of national parks with the Lake district in mind, but he was elitist, as he wanted it for "persons of pure taste" and feared
	<br><blockquote><p>"the destructive influence of artisans, labourers and the humbler class of shopkeepers whose common minds preclude pleasure from the sight of natural beauty."</p></blockquote>
He obviously reckoned that common people could not appreciate natural beauty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The world's first national park at Yellowstone, California, which was established in 1872, was an areas that was virtually untouched by man. I understand that international recognition of the term "national park" is what makes them important. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which lays down guidelines for national parks, suggests that areas can be designated as such parks first, if they are wilderness areas—extensive national landscapes of great beauty or sites of scientific interest, which have not been materially altered by human exploitation or occupation—and, secondly, if they are owned, or at least managed by the Government of the country, primarily for the purposes of conservation, but also for public enjoyment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem about ownership of land in Scotland. Large tracts of land are often sold to unknown purchasers or shadowy, anonymous companies that are based in Liechtenstein, Switzerland, the Caribbean and so on. I could never dispute the beauty of the areas involved, nor the desire to protect and conserve them, but to call any part of Scotland a "park" is ridiculous. I have a copy of a letter from the director general of the Countryside Commission for England to the director of the Countryside Commission for Scotland who says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is anomalous that there should be national parks in England and Wales but not in Scotland, even though that country has superior scenic and wildlife resources to that south of the border."</p></blockquote>
That is a non-argument.

I understand that the national parks of Dartmoor and the Lake district have not been a great success. They are classic examples of the honeypot effect, referred to by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). Tourists flock to the areas in droves, with the resultant spoliation. Loch Lomond was discussed briefly. Perhaps it is a special case as it covers a large area, taking in my constituency, but I hope that we shall have a chance to discuss it in more detail later. There is no doubt that Ben Lomond is becoming an absolute mess,

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly, what we do is a matter for lengthy debate and consideration. What about the 350,000 people who live in the highlands? A recent article in 
	<i>The Independent</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most tourists equate national parks with national playing fields. If they see a green spot on a map, they head straight for it, and assume that they will find all kinds of recreational activities laid on."</p></blockquote>
As many members of the Committee will know, the debate goes back for generations. Sir Robert Cowan recently drew the matter to our attention when he quoted an extract from the west highland survey produced by Frank Fraser Darling in the late 1940s. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Never more than now, we need vision in the countryside, but it must be a broad vision that can see our land from many points of view."</p></blockquote>
That is significant because, as the hon. Member for Tayside North, said, the issue involves planning activities and will affect especially those people who live and work in the countryside.

Among those objecting to the latest proposals on national parks is the Scottish Crofters Union which, while agreeing that culture, landscape and ecology are worthy of conservation, believes that national park designation is an entirely inappropriate means of achieving that. The Scottish Crofters Union agrees with many of the points made in the document "The Mountain Areas of Scotland" about agriculture, forestry and tourism, but it has grave reservations about the document's conclusions. It considers that the assumption that the only reason why those mountain areas have survived is that land users have not found a way of making more commercial use of them is not true. Furthermore, it says that the suggestion that crofters are not capable of managing the land responsibly, and that such a responsibility must be assumed by a public agency, is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One needs only to look at the Lake district to understand my objection to national parks. Nature is a living thing and sometimes it is abused, as occurs in parts of industrial Scotland. Sometimes it is adorned, as in parts of Fife or Perthshire, by the activities of man. A national park is an attempt to sterilise nature and the activities of those who live in the park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One place that I never wish to revisit is the English Lake district where everything has been twee-ified rather like Assisi compared with San Gimignano in Italy. San Gimignano is natural while Assisi is a national monument where every stone is in the right place, every dustbin is of the right shape, every toffee paper is removed and every house is painted indentically. The place has been sterilised and the prospect of a superenogative planning authority which imposes a tyranical orthodoxy on an area of the countryside, is one I greatly fear. I fear it because I have not been impressed by the taste of local authority planning committees or even of their officials.

I could show hon. Members around Perthshire and demonstrate that these bodies and officials have permitted abhorrent things. Such officials would be in charge of the great organisation that is proposed and I do not believe that that is the best way in which to manage the countryside.

What strikes those who go to the Lake district is how well the area is conserved and preserved, considering the numbers who visit it. It provides a classic example why such special arrangements are needed to protect areas such as the path up Ben Nevis. There is degradation of all of our mountain areas and the hon. and learned Gentleman's assessment of the Lake district is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my view and the Arizona and Yellowstone national parks are exactly the same. Such areas are in the hands not of those who live in them, but of organisations, such as the National Trust and others. The hands of mortification and institutionalisation are put on them. The great wonder of our countryside is that it is natural and belongs to those who live there and have feelings for and understanding of it. Such people as the farmers of Scotland have looked after it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State wants additional planning control to correct the difficulties that arise. Ben Nevis is a good place to consider because Fort William is the result of a planning authority and a more hideous place could not be conceived of as an environmental dwelling area, although it is in a beautiful site. I do not trust a quango to run the countryside of Scotland. Scotland is one great national park and if the Secretary of State requires additional powers to correct difficulties on Loch Lomondside he should bear that in mind.

I remember when the first plans were produced. Strathclyde regional council proposed three plans for Loch Lomond and all of them were absolutely appalling with their provision for signs showing where to picnic, where to park and where park patrol officers and Range Rover parking places could be found.

Several hon. Members have rightly said that there is a need for greater integration of the management regimes over the many sensitive areas of the highlands and islands. I am sceptical whether the national parks route is the right one. A case has been made for a national park-like regime in an area such as the Lomonds, but I am doubtful whether that is the best route for other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an instinctive reaction in favour of the name "natural heritage areas", as opposed to "national parks". Names are important. One of the arguments for using the designation "national parks" is that it is recognised by conservationists internationally. Therefore, the use of that designation to manage Scottish sensitive areas would put us at the front of the queue for international attention and, possibly, even for the allocation of international resources. The name is important for those who favour national parks, but it is also important for those who have reservations, such as the Scottish Crofters Union. The concept of living in a park, as opposed to living in a real community, would not commend itself to many people in the highlands and islands, because "park" has connotations of a leisure and recreational area. It may be a misnomer, given the concept of "national park", but the name "park" is redolent of that. We must be sensitive to that. We have seen the difficulties and the initial hostility that can be generated by using the wrong name in the saga of the sites of special scientific interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be cautious in our approach to the concept of national parks. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) commented appropriately that the situation is not comparable to that of the American national parks because there a genuine wilderness existed and the parks were there before the communities were established. Likewise, there is no straightforward comparison with English national parks, because the history of land ownership and land use in Scotland, particularly in the highlands, is utterly different from that in England. That creates sentiments and reactions to proposals for land management and land use which are entirely different in the highlands from reactions in a place such as the Lake district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
Certainly local communities in the Lake district were worried at the time that the bodies that were to be set up would not reflect their interest and involvement in the area. Before the English national parks were established, similar apprehension was felt by the local communities. However, that apprehension is nothing compared with the centuries of suspicion that would have to be overcome in the highlands about any move to reduce the democratic involvement of local communities in managing their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are tentative about the matter. We must consider what the Government envisage happening in their natural heritage area scheme. I am referring more to the highlands and islands communities and the Wester Ross and Lochaber designations than to the Lomond designation. We must ensure that there is proper integrated management of such highly sensitive areas. At the same time, we must ensure that the system of management is not foisted on local communities, but fits in with the nature of their areas. The local authorities must have primacy in the designated areas. Ratepayers—as they will be known in the future—must be able to approach a councillor to contribute directly to the decision-making process for their areas. They should not have a councillor who will then be represented on some grand board, which local people will consider a body one removed from them. There must be a local link.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I believe, however, that Frank Bracewell, the planning officer for central region, and several other people are right to be serious about the Lomond national park. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) agrees. I wish to ask two pertinent questions that the Committee might find interesting. I refer first to land management orders. They are crucial to a proper scheme for the development of such areas. The document, "The Mountain Areas of Scotland", a report on public consultation sent to us by the Countryside Commission, states on page 9, under the heading of "Land Management Orders":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Several respondents commented in relation to paras 5.11 and 5.12 of the Mountain Areas report that 'poor stewardship' must be more closely defined. Gordon District Council feared that land management orders will not be enforceable. The SLF'—</p></blockquote>
the Scottish Landowners Federation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"considered that landowners must have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State over land management orders and that landowners must be motivated by incentive rather than compulsion."</p></blockquote>
After some discussion, the CC responded as follows:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission should not seek to define closely 'poor stewardship' as this could constrain the circumstances in which it could be deemed to have occurred. Land management orders or some equivalent sanction should remain as part of the range of measures recommended to secure good management of mountain areas."</p></blockquote>
The Minister will have that document, which is the report published by the Countryside Commission. One of its recommendations is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"grants should encourage quality of management and development and achieve public benefits beyond the prime purpose of each grant, such as support to remote rural economies, and also promote sustainable use".</p></blockquote>
It states, too, that there should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"co-operation between government agencies over the integration of land management grants".</p></blockquote>
It is pertinent for the Committee to know the Government's attitude towards land management grants. I again refer to the Countryside Commission and what was sent to it by Martin Holdgate, who is now based in Europe. At the launch of Dr. John Rodwell's book, "Crown Communities of Britain", I had the opportunity to talk to Martin Holdgate, whom I have known for many years. He expressed concern about how the bill deals with zonation. Page 2 of the document, headed "Boundaries and Zonation" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst the boundaries suggested for the national parks in the report are purely indicative—and provide a basis for further discussion and consultation—we were particulary interested to note the application of the zonation concept and the proposed inclusion of community zones. This approach accords generally with the IUCN's recognition of the great importance"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are discussing the amendment referring to national parks. Does that report refer to national parks, or is it more general?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a historical perspective on the debate about national parks in Scotland, and we should understand where the arguments against such parks have come from traditionally. The case for national parks, notably in Scotland but everywhere else, has been in favour of widening access and allowing more people into the countryside. Resistance has come from those with the greatest vested interest in keeping people out of the countryside. That is the historical truth, which I shall trace briefly in the Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opposition to such a proposal will always use other devices. Preposterously, local democracy will be used as an argument to oppose the creation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
national parks or similar schemes. The idea that perfect democracy operates in rural Scotland is nonsense. I regret when bodies, such as the Scottish Crofters Union, allow themselves to come in behind this sort of argument. Wester Ross is the only area that is relevant to the SCU's objections. That area consists of tiny huddles of population along the shoreline, and there are vast acreages behind them over which they have no control or influence. Yet they give thanks for the great democratic protection that they believe they have and think that they somehow control events in Wester Ross. It is not true. The people who control access and development in Wester Ross, as elsewhere are those who own the land. It is as simple as that. "The Mountain Areas of Scotland" is an excellent document, but there could be far greater democratic participation in the future of those areas.

The idea that the designation of national parks is an alien imposition on Scotland is another argument that I find offensive. I know that some Conservative Members would resist such a proposal in other contexts. When something is suggested for Scotland which already exists in England, it is always argued that it is being imposed in Scotland because of its existance in England. That is nonsense. The history of the national parks debate in Scotland long predates anything that has happened in England. The man who is revered in north America, Although like so many prophets, not in his own land, as the instigator of the national parks concept is John Muir, a Scots who was born in 1838. He introduced national parks to north America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Gentleman draws attention to the position in the United States of America. As someone who has camped and caravanned extensively in almost every national park in the United States—[
	<i>Interruption</i>] Yes, I have spent many years camping and caravanning abroad because there is much to learn from other countries. The hon. Gentleman must realise that people did not live in Yosemite or any other parts of north America when the national park system began. No one worked the land and the circumstances that prevailed there are not comparable with those in the highlands of Scotland today. We are not comparing like with like, which should be borne in mind when referring to North America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is finding difference where there is none. Of course people live in those areas, but the vast majority of the territory is uninhabited. There is no contradiction between those two statements. The difference between what happened in north America, New Zealand and other parts of the world where national parks exist and flourish is not the one that the hon. Member for Tayside, North defined, but one of having access to the land. In those places, land could be taken over to create national parks. Historically, that is from where resistance has come in Scotland. The people who own the land see their rights being impinged upon by the creation of national parks, which lead to greater access to the land. That is the historical truth of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

John Muir, a Scot, is the father of national parks world wide. In 1884, James Bryce, who was then the Member of Parliament for Aberdeen, introduced an Access to Mountains (Scotland) Bill, which did not pass first base. Since then there has been a steady procession of attempts to introduce the concept of national parks into Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1929, Ramsay MacDonald set up a committee to examine the case for national parks in Britain. It was in favour of them, especially in the Cairngorms. The committee's recommendations were greeted with hostility by the landowning lobby which was represented by the Association of County Councils in Scotland, so nothing happened. In both Scotland and England momentum was gathering at that time. The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland—it has nothing to do with England— instigated a Scottish Standing Committee on national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the second world war the time was ripe for legislation and, indeed, it was introduced for national parks in England and Wales and the Nature Conservancy Council was created. Although the committee on national parks in Scotland recommended the establishment of five national parks, fierce resistance from the landowning lobby prevented their establishment and by the mid-1950s the issue had gone away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was irritated to hear the name of Frank Fraser Darling prayed in aid of the case against national parks. He was the greatest Scottish authority and visionary on land use. He wrote of the
	<br><blockquote><p>"shortsightedness and wrongheadedness of that decision"</p></blockquote>
not to establish national parks, which
	<br><blockquote><p>"becomes the more apparent as the recreational function of wild lands is realised as an urgent and proper form of land use."</p></blockquote>
So, whoever else is prayed in aid of the populist cause by those who say that there is something wrong, wicked or exclusive about national parks, it cannot be Frank Fraser Darling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am in favour of local democracy. It is odd to hear Conservative Members calling local democracy sacred, as if they were in favour of giving more powers to local authorities.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is not being fair. I said that the planning authorities were appalling and that Aviemore was a quintessential example of that.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The direct answer to that is Sir Hugh Fraser and the good Mr. Pottinger, but we shall not go down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may remember that a road was made from Loch Lomond through Glen Fruin to the Clyde submarine base at Faslande. Local democracy did not count there. The Ministry of Defence paid between £8 million and £10 million for that road, which is for its use only. As the Member for that area I used that road. A senior official, who is not there now and can no longer be charged, told me not to tell anyone that I was on the road. He had an agreement with the landowner.

We talk about local democracy, but there is a long way to go. The public should have access to national parks. Access should not be held by a minority, to the exclusion of everyone else, even Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Many of the communities in greatest proximity to national park areas are not magnificent advertisements for local democracy. Yesterday I passed through Tyndrum, which is properly mentioned at regular intervals during our debate. If we went out of our way to create a rural shanty town, we would have a hard job producing anything worse than Tyndrum. Fort William—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. and learned Gentleman has strong feelings about Fort William and I understand why. Tartan trinket villages exist in parts of rural Scotland, having been created by commercial forces. It is not an argument for the supremacy of local democracy to claim that it and market forces have done such a magnificent job on many small and naturally attractive places in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not market forces that create such places, but planning authorities which, scandalously, permit them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is splitting hairs. The two go hand in hand. He seeks to maintain the system. He criticised the planning authorities, but by setting his face against another regime he supports the system that produced them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want not to reduce democratic involvement, but to change its nature. I believe in local democracy, but recognise that there is a wider national interest in large parts of Scotland. Someone should not be able to assert the supreme local right to decide what will or will not happen because, by force of history or circumstance, he is living in a particular place at a particular time. The principle of national interest is widely accepted in other areas. Why should it not be accepted in the environment. Many areas of Scotland are important, not just to local communities but to the wider national community. Local democratic supremacy is a highly selective argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking as though everything was ideal and sturdy local democracy was working well. The honeypot effect will not be imposed through the creation of national parks, but can already be seen in action in places to which we referred earlier. There are dreadful examples of the honeypot effect, which are becoming worse with every passing year. The issue has become the whipping boy of the debate—I am not referring to the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross. I have been passing through Tyndrum for years, usually as fast as my vehicle will carry me. Five or six years ago it was an attractive place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) said that

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to flatter the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I was reading his autobiography recently and I was most interested to learn that the hon. and learned Gentleman almost became the Tory candidate for Bute and north Ayrshire, only thereafter moving on to Tyndrum, which was second choice to Millport. That is another story, however, and who knows what would have happened if he had become the candidate for Bute and north Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone accepts that commercial pressures have increased rapidly in the past few years, leading to linear development and tawdry commercial developments. That is the honeypot effect in action— we do not have to wait for the establishment of national parks to see that happen. My argument is that if the availability of access is dispersed, the pressure on tourist centres will be reduced. The local democratic argument does not work well on either count. The national interest must be set alongside local interests. The honey-pot effect needs to be defeated urgently because it already exists. It will not be threatened by the creation of national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we left with? I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). In his splendid and balanced speech, he said that we are sympathetic to the concept of national parks. We also understand, however, that the concept is bedevilled by terminology; the name "national park" sometimes produces a rational reaction, but more often a knee-jerk one. There is a need for a management scheme and a sympathetic and individualistic approach to each of those areas, they are under intense pressure from those who visit for recreational or simple tourist purposes. In that spirit we look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and in that light we shall judge the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has been particularly interesting is that the debate on this issue has reflected Scottish opinion, which is split down the middle.

We heard three speeches against from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn), my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and from the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie), who was strongly against. Two other speeches—one was an intervention by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh)—were not only sceptical, but unconvinced, but they, too, were possibly against. If I understood the gist of his speech, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) may be in favour, but not for his own area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not extraordinary that we shall not hear an exposition of the views of the Scottish National party on such a major issue? Is that it? Have we heard it all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall hear more before the debate is concluded. I was responsible for starting that debate when I asked the CCS to explore the arguments for and against national parks and to make a thorough study. I put on record my thanks to the CCS for the thorough way in which that was done. I stress that it was not quite as simple as some might have thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked the CCS to report on September 1989, but the report was not produced until September 1990—one year later. That report was followed by further consultation and the final report was published only yesterday. I saw an advance copy on Friday. I must make it clear that it is usual and customary to consider final reports with great care. We have no desire to break with that custom by giving a final response this morning. It would be not only inappropriate but discourteous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to appreciate not only that we want to take account of the views expressed this morning, but that we want to find the best way forward, which will involve careful consideration of that 50-page document in the next few days. I noticed that copies were not availabe, so we spent time this morning making photocopies, which are available to those members of the Committee who do not have a copy. We want to study the report with great care before making a final reply on the major issue of upland management in Scotland. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North that we should not rush into a precipitate conclusion. I am glad that the hon. Member for Dumbarton has tabled a new clause, which means that we shall return to the issue before long. An amendment on natural heritage areas will also be tabled. We intend to publish a statement on the report shortly. The issue will be reconsidered at the end of part I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about the principle of zonation. After studying our draft
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
consultation paper on natural heritage areas, he will know that we support that principle. The hon. Gentleman also asked about land management grants; I understand that we are to debate that under amendment No. 15 to clause 5, so we shall come to that soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's proper reluctance to comment on the report, but what is the time-scale for a considered response from the Scottish Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need two days. We shall work at it as hard as we can. We shall return to the issue on new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Dumbarton, and the Government will also table an amendment on natural heritage areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our belief that natural heritage areas can coexist with national parks, but the CCS takes a different view. We want to consider that point with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I shall try to put the matter into context. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross referred to Scotland as one great national park. There is no doubt that the whole of the uplands, north and south of the central belt, can be regarded as areas of the highest natural environmental quality, for which Scotland is rightly famous throughout the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated the question of access thoroughly. It can be dealt with by SNH access agreements, which come under clause 12 and schedule 3. As the Committee will recall from Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Government had made no final decision on the CCS's proposals to establish four national parks. He warmly welcomed the mountain areas report published last September. We accept its basic aims of conserving and enhancing the qualities of Scotland's mountain environment while ensuring that local communities can benefit from the development of natural resources in a sustainable manner. Responsiveness to local communities was referred to by the hon. Members for Argyll and Bute and for Western Isles and, obviously, we regard that as important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the CCS that mountain areas need integrated management. We have responded to its call for interim measures for the Cairngorms by announcing the creation of a working party under the chairmanship of Magnus Magnusson to recommend an integrated management strategy for the area in the light of the Government's decision to propose the area for world-heritage status. Our aim is to find a management structure that will suit the special circumstances of the area. We will look in the first instance to SNH to take the lead in implementing our discussions resulting from the working party's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday, we received the CCS's analysis of the responses to its consultation exercise. We have reached no firm conclusions on the matter, but there is a lack of consensus on national parks in three areas, one of which is Wester Ross. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden referred to Beinn
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
Eighe, which is a remarkable area. It is a site of special scientific interest and I was there for the opening of a study centre, which has been of great use to specialists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opinion is divided on the Cairngorms, and objections have been expressed about Ben Nevis and Glencoe. We shall carefully consider the responses and the CCS analysis before announcing our conclusions. We look forward to debating the new clause of the hon. Member for Dumbarton, by which time we will have reached a final decision. Therefore, I hope that Opposition Members will not consider it necessary to press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary as the natural heritage of Scotland would, by definition, include any area given special status by a new designation. As the use of the word "including" in the amendment makes clear, SNH's general advisory function, as set out in clause 2(1)(a), would already enable it to advise on matters such as the designation of sites as national parks. I have nothing to add at this stage to what I have said already. Once the Government have had the chance to study all the responses, we shall reach a decision on the CCS proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Views expressed by writers of recent newspaper articles claiming that the Scottish Office is against national parks are speculation. I understand that there has been considerable debate among members of the CCS and that there is, by no means, unanimity on the means of dealing with the management of mountain areas. We have not had the opportunity to come to a final view. The CCS has submitted its analysis and conclusions following the consultation exercise. We hope to reach a conclusion shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before reaching that conclusion, will the Minister say whether he considers that there is a difference between Loch Lomond, on the one hand, and any national park in the highlands and islands, on the other? Does the Scottish Office regard them as different kettles of fish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The responses were different. More people supported the case for a national park for Loch Lomond than they did for the other areas to which I have referred. We are considering carefully what would be the best way forward. We are aware of the special pressures that exist in the Loch Lomond area arising from its attractiveness and its close proximity to centres of population. In reaching our decision, we will give full consideration to the views of people in that area and examine carefully the responses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked for the report from the CCS my primary concern was to achieve the best possible arrangements for the mountain areas for Scotland. We want to ensure that proper mechanisms are established that will meet the problems of those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden asked about the Cairngorms. We have submitted our case for a tentative listing of it as a world-heritage site, and we await the outcome of UNESCO's deliberations. The working party will soon begin its task and we expect it to take into account the CCS report and the responses to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about resources. It is premature to take decisions on the resource requirements of a proposal that has just been submitted in final form. Government agencies already provide substantial support in connection with the conservation and enjoyment of our natural heritage in the special areas, so we shall look in the first instance to SNH to develop its programmes in areas that are under pressure and those that are of national importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that it is the considered view of central region, as put forward by the planning officer, that—I quote from the document sent by Frank Bracewell to the Scottish Landowners Federation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Greater financial assistance is required to enable Land Managers to maintain and enhance the landscape features such as open moorland, native woodlands, traditional buildings and field boundaries. Without additional resources, the landscape deterioration will continue"?</p></blockquote>
That is part of the reason that that authority is so desperate about Lomond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we shall have to consider the matter of resources on a continuing basis. As I said during the debate on the schedule, we shall examine carefully the need for further resources in the next public expenditure survey round and will bear in mind the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute asked about the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. We are aware of the views of the IUCN, but I note that its main concern is an integrated conservation policy that reflects the special needs of Scotland. The Government are determined to achieve such a policy and that will be a major priority for SNH. The structure of any new management regime must accurately reflect local conditions, and I am sure that the IUCN will recognise that. I agree strongly with what the hon. Lady said about responsiveness to those who live in the local areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sums up the essence of the debate. It has been a marker for the more substantial debate that will take place in a few days, and it is useful to have heard the opinions of hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. We were keen to initiate the debate today and, as the Minister said, we shall return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons that we wanted to start the debate today was to try to influence the Minister's thoughts on the natural heritage areas. He has not dealt extensively with the matter which, he tells us, he is still considering. He spoke about the CCS and said that he wanted the best way forward. He said he wanted to study the proposals of the CCS with great care and to avoid precipitate decisions, yet that is what he has taken on his natural heritage areas. The CCS report on how to manage the upland areas and selected mountain areas has been available for a number of years for study and consultation, whereas natural heritage areas have been the subject of secret consultation for a few months only and have not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
been subjected to wide public consultation, yet the Minister is proposing to introduce such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that natural heritage areas will co-exist with national parks, but that is not true. The Minister's document, which contains responses to the CCS report up to 12 February, proposes a land management forum. I know that Magnus Magnusson suggests that that might apply only to the mountain zones in the national parks, but there is no way that one body could run a national park, a natural heritage area within it, and a land management forum within that. The two cannot possibly co-exist. The Minister is pre-empting the debate on the national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem is that natural heritage areas represent a top-down solution. Both sides have made great play of involving the local community, and I agree that without local involvement such projects will not work, however, the proposal for natural heritage areas is a top-down solution from the SNH. Its secretariat will propose the plans, set up the management committees and run those areas. National parks, by contrast, are a democratic local solution and will not be run by SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain unhappy with what I have heard about the natural heritage areas. The Minister has not assuaged my anxieties. I hope that he will seriously consider my argument before he tables his amendment on the natural heritage areas. Perhaps it would be better if he delayed introducing such a proposal until he can make a definite suggestion on the introduction of national parks. However, I am pleased with the debate that we have had this morning, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 2, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(bb) the provision of advice to the Secretary of State on the establishment and conduct of a special committee to guide the proper integration of development and conservation policies throughout the rural economy with the principles of sustainable resource use.".</p></blockquote>
We have just concluded an important debate, which, as the Minister said, is a marker for the more substantive debate that we shall have later. Amendment No. 54 raises an important issue, too. Our previous debate concerned how to combine the pressure for development with the desire for conservation and management of some four environmentally sensitive areas. The amendment is also about how to combine the pressure for development with the desire for conservation, not just in isolated sensitive areas but throughout the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment, SNH would, as one of its tasks, establish a special committee to consider how to apply the sustainable development philosophy throughout the rural economy. Although the committee would be led and resourced by SNH, it would try to involve in its work other agencies, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
have important developing influences on the rural economy. Such agencies would primarily be local authorities, but they would include those that dealt with forestry, tourism, and fish-farming, such as the Crown Estate Commissioners and the Highlands and Islands development board. The various agencies whose work impinges on the development side of the rural economy should be given access to, and represented on, a special committee that would be set up by SNH to try to integrate its works and goals with the work and goals of the other agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key word in the amendment is "integration". The failure to integrate development and conservation policies has led to resource use conflicts that have bedevilled the work of voluntary environmental organisations and the NCC over the past decade. There have been conflicts over Islay about which the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) has tabled a new clause, about Craig Meagaidh, and the flow country. Such controversies led, in part, to the introduction of the Bill. They put pressure on the decentralisation of the work of the NCC, which the Government took further and used as a pretext for breaking up the NCC. Therefore, the reason for such conflicts is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee that would be set up under the amendment should try to work with the other bodies that have played a role in earlier conflicts to resolve other conflicts before they got out of hand. Ultimately, intractable conflicts would require political decisions and the intervention of the Secretary of State to resolve them, but a great number of their causes could be avoided if the agencies worked together much earlier in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such integration is at the core of the amendment, but the phrase "throughout the rural economy" is of equal importance. The new body should not focus on looking after the interests of the national scenic areas, nature reserves and SSSIs for which it will have responsibility. Each of those sites is important and there are a great number of them, so the agency could easily become bogged down in trying to manage and look after the interests of individual sites. That would be a great mistake and it would represent a missed opportunity. I hope that the agency will regard its remit as the application of the sustainable development philosophy throughout the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A special committee of the sort that I suggest, which was led, staffed and resourced by SNH, but which involved various development bodies such as the HIDB, the tourist bodies and so on, would provide an ideal forum to develop a sustainable development philosophy that was applicable throughout the Scottish rural economy. I had a conversation with Dr. John Francis, the director in Edinburgh of the NCC for Scotland, when he visited the House last week to talk to hon. Members about the Bill. He wanted to ensure that the new agency would work closely, and perhaps even have joint working committees, with various local authorities to try to resolve conflicts of the type that have arisen in the past before they became politically sensitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholly agree that that should be a purpose of SNH. However, rather than seeking to work with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
several different local authorities through working committees, each in isolation, it would be better if a special committee of SNH could be designated for that purpose. One of the great problems of conservation in the recent past has been that it has been shut off in a sort of ghetto in which the prime focus has been on the word "conservation". There has also been a ghetto in the geographical area in which a conservation philosophy is applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be healthy for the future work of SNH if it could get out of the sectoral trap in which it has been placed and work closely with other bodies that have tremendous influence on the rural economy. Together, they could try to develop a sustainable development philosophy that could be applied throughout the rural economy. Obviously, that would require a large amount of resources if pilot projects were to be undertaken properly. There would be a need for research and access would have to be ensured to the various public agencies and, ultimately, the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the good intentions of the Minister and those who will take over the new agency, I fear that, unless they are told at this early stage that that will be one of their main responsibilities, they will be buried by the simple day-to-day task of managing and running the various sites. They will never be able to develop the sustainable development philosophy necessary for the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot countenance or specify the setting up of a special committee for that purpose, I hope that he will at least make it clear that he understands that one of SNH's major tasks will be to work with public agencies. That philosophy should be developed not only for the various areas of special importance, but for the whole of the rural economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland is an ideal administrative unit in which to integrate policies of sustainable development. Scotland presents a challenge that deserves special scrutiny at this early and critical stage of policy development. The less populated parts of Scotland represent 30 per cent. of the land area of Great Britain, but support only 2 per cent. of the population. It has long been acknowledged that rural development relies largely on the use of natural resources—water, soils and landscapes—whose historical mismanagement is a crippling handicap to the present-day rural economy. Their conservation and enhancement, as a basis for rational use, is therefore crucial. The amendment turns the attention of members of the Committee to those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship between development and conservation is closer here than in almost all of Europe. The troubles of the fishing industry, the declining productivity of hill land and the risks involved in marine fish-farming all demonstrate that fact. Sustainable development—sustainable use of resources—is, therefore, an immediately applicable concept. It would involve the management of living resources to yield the optimum sustainable benefits for local people. There is an obvious need for that, yet no structure has been created for rural development policy to be established or implemented on such
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
integrated lines, despite the unparalleled opportunities offered within the Scottish Office. Given the relatively small administrative area of Scotland, the Scottish Office structure could allow a multi-sectorial approach. To my knowledge, that has not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most serious shortcomings is that conservation and development policies are still institutionally separate. That is immediately damaging to nature conservation and rural development prospects in areas where the relationship between those elements is closest. In Scotland, those problems should be tackled first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implementation of sustainable development represents nothing more than the integration of nature conservation into resource use policy, binding development and conservation together for the long-term benefit of local economies. There is, therefore, a need to organise policy integration by creating a suitable organisation. Nature conservation is not simply the defence of specialist interests by means of protective designations. Its purpose should be to ensure the sound use and management of natural resources everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, in 1988 the Brundtland report stressed the need for new institutional structures for integrated resource management. The Government are committed to sustainable development, as the Bill shows, yet they have not proposed institutional structures to carry through their declared policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide one option. It is not the only one. Even the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) might acknowledge its defects. However, at least it focuses the Committee's attention on the problem, and asks the Government what they are doing to create the organisation that would enable them to carry out their policy of sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sustainable development—development with conservation for the long-term benefit of local economies—is best tackled where those factors are most closely related, such as in Scotland. Scotland is organisationally ideal to allow that, but I have still not heard the Government say what they intend to do to create such integration, which their policy demands. A body that would ensure positive, sustainable development is possible and would be relatively easy to organise in Scotland. The Government must seriously address the need for positive organisation for sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is inadequate, but it serves a useful purpose in that it highlights that important issue and enables us to question the Minister on how he intends to deliver the policy under the Bill of sustainable resource development. I hope that the Minister will tell us about that before the debate ends. The hon. Member for Western Isles has done a service to the Committee in raising that topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is technically correct or flawed in the view of parliamentary draftsmen but it is an important and substantial amendment, which deserves to be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all received a letter on sustainability that was written on 8 February by Simon Pepper of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The concept of sustainable use of resources was first promoted in the 'World Conservation Strategy' (1980). Since then it has been gaining ground, with the United Kingdom government's endorsement in 1985 and the report of the Brundtland committee, 'Our Common Future', in 1987.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The concept establishes a broader base for conservation effort, beyond the narrow protection of specialist interests and aesthetic values, to cover resource issues generally. The intention is to 'meet the needs of the present, without jeopardising the interests of future generations', or to enable people to 'satisfy their needs and improve their lives without lessening the earth's capacity to support them and their descendants'. The concept emphasises the role of conservation as the basis of sound development, and the need to maintain the earth's stock of natural capital, living only on the income.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sustainability or 'sustainable development' has been vigorously promoted by the government in broad terms (eg 'Sustaining Our Common Future', DoE, 1989; 'Scotland's Natural Heritage, The Way Ahead', SDD, 1990; and 'This Common Inheritance', DoE, 1990). It is also a linchpin of this Bill. Lord Strathclyde, introducing the Bill in the House of Lords (19 November 1990), said:

	<div class='ul'>
	<li>'The Bill has one overriding purpose, and that is to ensure that our natural environment in Scotland, and in particular the resources of land and water, are managed in a sustainable way to secure the inheritance of succeeding generations'.</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Debates in the House of Lords have revealed repeatedly that the concept is still far from achieving universal currency. Few, if any, understood the concept and definitions were repeatedly requested.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Bearing in mind the global importance of the concept, its central position in the government's approach to this Bill, and the immense value of legislation in raising awareness and changing attitudes, WWF strongly advocates the inclusion of a definition in the text of the Bill. We believe this definition should reflect the practical implications of sustainability, as spelt out in 'Scotland's Natural Heritage—The Way Ahead' namely: the preservation of biological diversity, the protection of natural ecosystems and the sustainable use of resources."</p></blockquote>
Many of us have been increasingly influenced by—though do not completely agree with—ideas put forward by the Gaia Foundation, James Lovelock and Ed Posey. Whatever our personal views might be—I have reservations—many people think that we should take seriously the protection, in a sustainable way, of mother earth—I put it in the rather attractive language that they use. I hope that my hon. Friend's amendment and the spirit of it will be incorporated in the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has slipped out of the Room for a moment. I shall begin with the remarks of the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell). He spoke about sustainability as the intention to meet the interests of present generations without jeopardising the interests of future generations. That is a sentiment with which we are in total agreement and to which we give active support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to note that the hon. Member for Western Isles has returned. I agree with him that it will be a major task of SNH to develop integrated policies and to work in partnership with other relevant interests.
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
He is also right that that was one of the main reasons for the establishment of SNH. As the hon. Gentleman knows, SNH has four regional boards—north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east, and one scientific research and development board. There is nothing in the Bill to stop SNH setting up a committee along the lines that the hon. Gentleman proposed. For that reason, the amendment is unnecessary. It will be for SNH to take the proposed course, if it considers that necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously SNH has that option. My concern was that unless there was a clear statement from the Minister, SNH would have so many other responsibilities, that that vital area, which has been absent from previous conservation agency work, would end up being neglected. It would be helpful if the Minister set out his views on the need for such an approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That leads on to the question asked by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) about what the Scottish Office has been doing. We were conscious of the need to ensure the best co-ordination of policies within the principles of sustainable development. We believe that the interests of rural communities require an approach based on partnership between all those who live in such areas, and the authorities and agencies whose task it is to deliver services there. I referred to the matter recently when I replied to an Adjournment debate initiated by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given practical effect to the need for the co-ordination of Government policies as they affect rural communities. The Secretary of State asked me to maintain a watching brief over the policies pursued by the Scottish Office, and I should like to read out the formal aim laid down for me. It is
	<br><blockquote><p>"To establish a coherent and integrated policy framework within which those who live in rural areas can derive improving standards and quality of living by using the local resource base in a sustainable way while maintaining the environment."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly in line with the thinking of the hon. Member for Angus, East and bears a remarkable similarity to the amendment. I draw attention to the reference to sustainable development and the integration of policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuing that aim I am supported by an interdepartmental group chaired by an under-secretary in the Scottish Office Environment Deparment. The group is made up of representatives from the main departments with rural interests and it can draw on the wide resources of the Scottish Office and the bodies that we sponsor. The group works mainly by the exchange of ideas and information so that policy development remains the responsibility of the appropriate department, but there is opportunity to make certain that the goals of sustainable development and prosperity in rural communities will be kept in view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements that I described encompass a far broader range of issues than those for which SNH will have responsibility. The hon. Member for Western Isles will recognise that it is for SNH to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
pursue the matter, if and when it so wishes. His amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt the Minister's good faith and sincerity, but where in the Bill is sustainability mentioned? It is not good enough simply to say that the amendment is not necessary. The Government often say that about amendments but, sometimes, it is necessary that certain measures are written into legislation. I shall withdraw that remark if the Minister can show me in the Bill where the word "sustainable" is used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1(1) makes it clear that its purpose is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"secure the conservation and enhancement of; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) to foster understanding and facilitate the enjoyment of, the natural heritage…in a manner which is sustainable."</p></blockquote>
We had a substantial debate on sustainability and the Committee agrees unanimously with that principle. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman supports—as we all do—the eight principles of the World Conservation strategy—"Caring for the World—A Strategy for Sustainability" to which I referred in a previous sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles especially wanted Scottish Natural Heritage to take seriously the sustainability duty. We have made clear our commitment to that in the consultation paper, "Scotland's Natural Heritage", and in the Bill. That point will be taken fully into account in the statement of strategy that we are preparing for SNH.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essence of the Minister's argument seems to be that the structure that I am suggesting is unnecessary because the bodies can have an input into Scottish Office considerations. At that level, there would be discussion, resolution and some sort of amalgamation, if appropriate, of the various approaches. However, would it not assist the work of the Scottish Office if the various bodies could use SNH, or a special sub-committee of SNH, as a forum for developing ideas in advance of and parallel with its input into the Scottish Office? Surely, that would relieve some of the burden on the Scottish Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that there are already four regional committees and a scientific committee. We do not consider that the amendment is necessary at this stage. However, if SNH wishes to establish such a committee, it will be free to do so. The hon. Gentleman floated a useful proposition, but a proliferation of committees should not be written into the statute, unless it is strictly necessary. I am content to leave such a matter to the judgment of SNH.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the briefing from Mr. Simon Pepper, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Debates in the House of Lords have revealed repeatedly that the concept is still far from achieving universal currency. Few, if any, understood the concept and definitions were repeatedly requested."</p></blockquote>
I understand that clause 1 contains a blanket commitment, but does the Minister have any
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
comments to make about the anxieties of the World Wide Fund for Nature? Are they entirely misplaced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a substantial debate on sustainability and the eight principles that I outlined during that debate all recommended themselves to the Committee. Some 20 definitions of the word "sustainability" have been made. It is generally accepted that the precise form of sustainability may change from decade to decade. We consider it undesirable to write into the Bill a precise definition that may change from year to year. Therefore, it is best to state the principle in strong terms, but not to be tied down to details that may change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden made a good attempt with his amendment, but I pointed out its inadequacies. The definition mentioned by the hon. Member for Linlithgow is perfectly adequate—the intention being to meet the interests of the present without jeopardising future generations. It is not necessary to write a precise definition into the Bill. The principle itself is well-established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One last intervention and I shall then be quiet on the subject. There is trouble with that argument. The hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) blurted out the word "nonsense" and the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) agrees with him. It is easy to pay lip service to the concept of sustainability, but rightly or wrongly many people do not believe in it. That is why some of us go on nagging at every possible opportunity to get those things written in. There is an abyss of difference in opinions on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The truth will out. We invent words which can be applied in different ways to wholly different things. If one talks of a crop of weeds, a beech wood or a mushroom, one is talking of three separate things. Sustainability is one of those new goop words that means nothing or anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get into a debate on the definition of sustainability, despite the temptation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). I hope that the sensible case that he made will be considered outside the House as well as within it. The creation of the new agency seems to be about heading off the sort of problems that have arisen in the past. Many of those problems were due to a lack of communication, misunderstandings and preconceived attitudes that become polarised. It makes emminent sense to have a committee working on pre-empting those disputes,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
so that we are spared the unsavoury sight of words such as populist. So often, those who revel in those arguments are populist by nature. We should be spared those confrontations. They need never arise because the two sides are not far apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could have gone further than accepting the spirit of the amendment. I hope that Scottish Natural Heritage itself will go further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. As my hon. Friend said, those conflicts are partly the reason for setting up the new agency. The resolution of those conflicts will not come about through having a new name for the NCCS or having the NCC established in Scotland. It will come about only if the various bodies embroiled in conflict in the past can reconcile some of the approaches. That does not require any esoteric concept or a sophisticated definition of sustainability. If people sit down together and talk about those things, some of the problems could be pre-empted, but once those problems reach the Scottish Office, the disputes will have become too entrenched to be amenable to peaceful solutions. Such a committee should be engaged on that task beforehand. I hope that SNH will take the idea forward. I am afraid that the Minister's response leaves me with no option but to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(h)the promotion of environmental education in cooperation with local authorities.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is as relevant in Springburn and Saltcoats as it is on Speyside and Skye. It goes to the root of the matters that we shall debate throughout the passage of the Bill. It is about creating in children from the youngest age an awareness of the environmental conditions in our country and the world. It is about giving status and presence within the educational system to environmental concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the first to acknowledge the praise the fact that in many, and probably most, schools environmental education exists and is promoted. Teachers, on their own initiative and within the curriculum, do a great deal of excellent work trying to enhance awareness, yet none of us can resist the conclusion that there is an awfully long way to go. Especially among children who grow up in urban or
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
semi-urban environments, there is often little awareness of environmental issues and matters of concern to rural areas. They identify such matters with a different world, a different culture and a different way of life. I have never tried to discover it for myself, but I am sure that it is sometimes difficult for teachers to inculcate in children an interest in and an awareness of matters that are of concern to a society with which they have little contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be overstated how important it is to give children from every background access to the countryside and first-hand experience of the wide and wonderful world that exists outside their normal living environment. I pay unstinting tribute to people within the education system, to community groups and to those who by voluntary efforts make sure that children can have that experience. Many of those people worry that the constraints on funds makes it increasingly difficult to organise such excursions and provide that wide education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's proposal is modest. It is not a criticism of what takes place within the education system or of the Bill. It does not propose to introduce a provision that does not already exist into the Bill. I fully acknowledge that Scottish Natural Heritage and its predecessor bodies already do much good work within the education system. I am aware of superb projects with which they have been involved in conjunction with schools. That is all taken as read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's argument that it is perhaps anomalous to include in the Bill specific duties in relation to specific environmental concerns, while omitting others. The Minister said that when we discussed the marine environment and it is a logical argument which I now acknowledge, even if I did not do so then. We are discussing a wider concept in this instance. The duty would cover a range of environmental concerns. We would give status to one of the assumed roles of SNH. We suggest that the new body would have a duty, not a right, to work with local authorities and schools to promote through the education system an awareness of and interest in environmental issues in children from an early age. It is an unexceptionable amendment that would be appreciated by SNH and would be widely welcomed by the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If from the earliest age people do not understand that there are many precious things in the world which may not have a direct relationship to them, there is less chance of their discovering that preciousness as the years go on. Some will and some will not, but they should be given that awareness. A conscious effort must be made to promote that awareness. I criticise no one, but it is distressing to see the lack of environmental awareness that exists in many parts of the community. It ranges from the way in which people dispose of litter, on the petty level, to a general disregard for beauty and nature, on the higher level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us put education and awareness up front and write it into the Bill. It is not enough to say that the right to promote awareness through the education system exists. We should impose a duty on SNH which will give it a better chance of being successful in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every sympathy with what the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) said. Whether the amendment should be included in the Bill is a matter for my hon. Friend the Minister, but it is essential for all children to understand the sensitivity, the excellence and natural grace of the countryside, because it is from that that all human worth and building is reflected. Anything that can be done to give children a comprehension of the countryside and the flora and fauna that inhabits it is central to civilisation. I support the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether I can finish the debate this morning, as I want to reply fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Dunnachie (Glasgow, Pollock)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just agree and then we can finish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I agree with the spirit of the amendment. We have set up an environmental education working group to review the existing provision for environmental education generally in Scotland, which will make
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
recommendations. The amendment would remove the necessary flexibility of SNH and would place too great an emphasis on that activity when it should choose its own priorities. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a Division. I can give more detailed reasons if he so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that response and will press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
