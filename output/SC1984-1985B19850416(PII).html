</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have reached the first of the clauses relating to the enforcement powers of Customs and Excise, the contents of which arise from the recommendations of the Keith committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury notes on clauses explain that the object of clause 11 is to amend the VAT law on criminal offences and penalties, and to provide that criminal penalties for VAT fraud are increased and that the power of arrest without warrant is conferred. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 were suggested to us by the Law Society and I believe that every member of the Committee has a copy of its memorandum. It states that we should be talking about fraudulent evasion, and the object of amendment No. 22 is to insert the word "fraudulent" in front of the word "evasion". That arises directly from paragraph 18.4.23 of the Keith committee report which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that this can best be achieved by extending the definition of fraudulent evasion".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is clear what is referred to and the simple objective of the amendment is to put that beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 deals with the part of the clause that creates a new power of interest. This, too, was a recommendation of the Keith committee in volume 1, paragraph 9.8.8. It recommended the creation of a power of arrest, but said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a power should be directed at the really serious cases … we prefer as a general rule that safeguards on which the taxpayer is entitled to rely should be set out in legislation.".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that it is clear that "really serious" offences are envisaged by the power of arrest. Obviously, this is a major change and the aim of amendment No. 23 is to make the matter clear beyond doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) on having tabled the amendments and on being, I believe, the first English Conservative Member to speak in the Committee. Obviously, he deserves our fulsome praise and tribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to a serious matter because the Keith committee said specifically that, in relation to evasion, it should be made clear that we are dealing with fraudulent evasion. I believe that it is accepted that accountants, taxation specialists and so on have a concept that distinguishes between avoidance and evasion, but, as far as I am aware, that concept is not recognised in law. Therefore, it is necessary to define evasion in the Bill so that it is objectively clear that it refers to fraud, which is why the introduction of the word "fraudulent" is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the same principle already exists in the main Act, which in section 1 mentions fraudulent evasion; the proposed new subsection (1A) mentions only "evasion". What we suggest is not redundant or designed to sabotage the legislation, nor is it a new idea. Perhaps the Minister will explain why clause 11(3) does not use the word "fraudulent"; it would be a logical tidying-up to accept our proposal and would give rise to a degree of symmetry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 31 addresses itself to a similar matter. Its aim is to introduce the concept of a "serious" offence into the Bill. After all, we are discussing the power of arrest without warrant, and who might exercise it and under what circumstances. As the Keith report recommends, such a power should be less than arbitrary and not used in trivial circumstances. The Law Society has pointed out that under the present wording of the clause someone issuing an inaccurate tax invoice could be arrested, which would be unnecessary for such a relatively minor offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should make certain that there would be an arrest only if there had been a fraud of some gravity. Perhaps the wording of amendment No. 23 in the name of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and myself is rather cumbersome. However, there may be some advantage in specifying that an arrest should take place only if it
	<br><blockquote><p>"is reasonably believed to be necessary for the protection of the Revenue or to ensure the administration of justice".</p></blockquote>
This is an important matter, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 22; it is a sensible amendment. I wish to draw the Committee's attention to my amendment No. 105, which is broadly in alignment with what was said by the hon. Members for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and for Beaconsfield. (Mr. Smith). It is important to recognise the necessity of detecting deliberate and organised fraud of a serious nature. That is right and proper, and the amendments help to do that in the context of striking a balance and making a distinction between serious indictable offences by inserting the word "fraudulent".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interesting distinction between the operation of the enforcement powers that the Customs and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
Excise assumes in clause 11 and the rather lackadaisical powers that it sometimes uses to enforce income tax provisions, chasing up income tax defaulters, avoiders and evaders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the clause goes too far. I accept that there was consultation. The Government produced draft clauses which interested parties were able to study. I welcome that. I recognise, too, that the Government conceded some points. However, the recommendations of the Keith report would have been better contained in one piece of legislation, rather than being tacked on to Finance Bills—as the VAT provisions of the Keith report are tacked on to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to compare clause 11, which gives VAT Customs and Excise inspectors the power to arrest, with section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an arrestable offence has been committed, he may arrest without a warrant anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of the offence".</p></blockquote>
In our debates on that section there was a degree of worry—to put it no higher—that it was too sweeping a power to give to a police constable. Yet clause 11 in this Bill gives that power to VAT inspectors. It is a power that we should give only after considerable thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us his interpretation of "an authorised person". We need to have a definition, and it should be made public. The circumstances in which the commissioner would empower an authorised person need to be made known, because people should be able to think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, if the power were abused, the provision would catch relatively trivial offences. Customs and Excise officers could arrest people who did not deserve that treatment—for offences such as inaccurate returns, and aiding and abetting the so-called black economy involving transactions of as little as £20, if the business was VAT-registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to have a case-by-case analysis in terms of the "authorised person" in clause 11, so that the person who is given the power to arrest can be ascertained in the context of a definite case—the power given by a commissioner for a definite purpose to an individual to execute that power only in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I put a genuine question to the Minister, because I feel that I may have missed something?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 11 (1) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 39 of the principal Act".</p></blockquote>
While Part II of the Bill contains references to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 and the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 nowhere is the Value Added Tax Act 1983 referred to. For my peace of mind, could the Minister explain that omission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>8.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Rees)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of important points have been made on this group of amendments. I recognise the importance of any measures dealing with criminalisation or decriminalisation. Powers of arrest in this area must be dealt with seriously, as they have been in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Smith) is supported by
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd). I think that it is in order for me to congratulate the hon. Member for Stretford, as this is the first occasion on which he has spoken from the Opposition Front Bench. I welcome him to the debate in that capacity, and we look forward to hearing his contributions on other equally important subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23, so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, seeks to establish beyond doubt the range of offences for which penalties are being stiffened. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that the clause goes too far for his liking. He will appreciate, on reflection, that half of the clauses in fact eases the taxpayer's position, because the latter half of the clause deals with matters of a technical nature that are being decriminalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of the clause deals with fraud proper and is in repsonse to the recommendations of the Keith committee. This is the first occasion—other than the Second Reading debate—on which I have had occasion to refer to the Keith committee, and I should like to congratulate the committee on having done a long and thorough job in this important field of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After we have examined this complex of provisions, I hope that the Committee will feel that the Keith committee struck a fair balance, doing a sensitive and conscientious job. We have taken the matter further, publishing a consultative document and then some draft clauses. Where we have diverged from the recommendations of the Keith committee we have done so to be a little more sensitive to the interests of taxpayers. That is a matter for debate. Where we are dealing with the liberty of the subject, with stiff penalties and with offences that we feel should retain criminal character, we have proposed the stiffening of penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be confident that ample justice has been done to the taxpayer's case, that he should be able to clear his name if needs be, and that he should not be exposed to undue harassment by the forces of the Executive. I am not suggesting for a moment that the Customs and Excise, and our other great department, the Inland Revenue, ever harass taxpayers. Nevertheless it is our duty as legislators to ensure that the possibility is removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield also tabled amendment No. 22. I understood from his powerful contribution that he is determined to ensure that only for offences that clearly involve fraud should the penalty be stifened and that, by extension, should the right of arrest that is to be found in subsection (6) be exercised. All the amendments in the group have that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's amendment refers to clause 11(3) and is designed to amend section 39 of the principal Act—the Value Added Tax Act 1983. Section 39(1) refers only to cases of "fraudulent" evasion. That phrase colours clause 11(3) and the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision covers cases of fraudulent claims for income tax and such matters. They would constitute "fraudulent" evasion which could give rise to this stiffer penalty of the power of arrest. If the word "fraudulent" were written into subsection (3), it could slightly broaden the scope beyond that which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield intends. This is a technical matter. Subsection (3) sets out three categories of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
actions by a taxpayer—repayments of VAT input tax claims or fraudulent claims in respect of bad debts—which would be subject to stiff penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "fraudulent" came before the word "evasion", the three claims would, without establishment of motive, have to be regarded as fraudulent actions. Customs and Excise would not be obliged to establish in any of the three actions in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>) or (
	<i>c</i>) that the taxpayer had a fraudulent intent when making a claim for a payment, refund or repayment. It would work against the taxpayer and not for him, which I am sure is not what my hon. Friend intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend meant that only fraudulent cases would be caught, a proviso which is established by section 39(1) of the principal Act. I hope that, on reflection, my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the hon. Member for Stretford will be prepared not to press the amendment, as it would work against the taxpayer's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 seeks to ensure that only serious offences involving fraud can give rise to the power of arrest. Clause 11, read with section 39, provides that acts by a taxpayer related to VAT that could involve fraudulent evasion and which have a fraudulent intent could give rise to this power of arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course not only trivial offences are involved. The hon. Member for Stretford pointed out that the maximum penalty for such offences is seven years imprisonment. I assure the Committee that the power of arrest would not be invoked for technical matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that there should be serious penalties for cases of very serious fraud. However, at the other end of the scale we may be bringing in much more trivial matters which would not warrant a penalty of seven years' imprisonment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. Neither as a matter of law nor of practice would Customs and Excise want to invoke the power of arrest, which as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire correctly and perceptively pointed out, is partly modelled on the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. There, the power is to be exercised by a constable. Here, it is to be exercised by "an authorised person". The hon. Gentleman asked what kind of person would be authorised. A specialist investigator from Customs and Excise would be authorised by that service to carry out the power of arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that we do not want to arm the Customs and Excise with sweeping powers of arrest for technical, trivial offences, nor does it want them. It has enough duties without that. Regrettably, since the first complex of powers was introduced in the Finance Act 1972, which was brought up to date and consolidated in the Value Added Tax Act 1983, the scale of offences has increased enormously. There have been recorded cases, especially with gold but also with carpets and other goods, where the sums involved exceeded £1 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A slight figure!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to remind us of the previous debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases that may involve a breach of fiscal criminal laws must be taken seriously and customs officers must be properly equipped. However, I assure the Committee that the power of arrest will be exercised only in a combination of circumstances where there is likely to
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
be fraudulent evasion which may incur a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment. The power will be introduced for only serious offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explanation meets the points raised by the hon. Gentlemen who contributed to this important debate. I return to the fact that only specialist investigating officers would be authorised by the Customs and Excise with the power of arrest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to establish whether there will be a body of people within the Customs and Excise with the authority to carry out the power of arrest. Will that power be available to them in their inside pockets as they go about their day-to-day duties or will it be tied to specific cases in specific circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A person would not be appointed senior principal or higher executive officer in that division and receive power automatically. It would be for only one case or for a complex of cases. I cannot confirm that the power would be authorised for just on a particular case. Often in this type of work the person identified as a culprit may be involved in several cases so an authorisation may cover more than one case, but it will not be obtained automatically on being accredited to a particular office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that after this important debate the Committee will feel that a fair balance has been struck between the legitimate needs of the Customs and Excise and the liberty of the subject and of the taxpayer. I hope that hon. Members will not press their amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable and learned Friend congratulated the Keith committee on its work and I associate myself with his praise. He then referred to the long consultative process after the report, on which I commend the Government. It was enormously valuable. It had two stages—a consultative document and draft clauses—and all interested parties could comment. That is the way that such complex, technical legislation should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the general balance about right. However, having said that, it is important to consider such matters. I followed my right honourable and learned Friend's argument about the word "fraudulent," and I am aware that in the principal Act the word "fraudulent" appears at the top but not subsequently. I felt that it was right to raise the matter as the Law Society had shed some doubt on it but I am reassured by what my right honourable and learned Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly less reassured on amendment No. 23. I understand that the power of arrest will arise only in relation to fraud. But there can be minor fraud. As the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) said, a VAT invoice for £20 could be raised fraudulently—although I do not know why anyone would want to do that. If I intended to commit fraud I should go for more than £20. Perhaps £1 million would be a more sensible figure. But a reference to fraud does not necessarily mean that a substantial amount is involved, so I am not entirely happy on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Law Society's original interpretation supplemented by the advice of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
Queen's Counsel in the shape of the Chief Secretary, we have to be impressed by the somewhat strange argument that by adding the word "fraudulent" we should be enhancing rather than delimiting the evasion. But I shall accept the Chief Secretary's words for the moment, and study them carefully with a view to returning to the subject if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary rightly paid tribute to the Keith Committee for its work, and said that it had struck a fair balance. He said that where the Government had deviated from that fair balance—deviation from the fair balance may be the right way of putting it—they had done so in favour of the taxpayer. Unfortunately that is not altogether our view of the matter. Keith was specific in the use of the word "serious" to describe an offence. That was hammered home in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary was quite right to say that we are all concerned about the gravity of arrestable offences because it is a matter of massive import to those involved. We all take seriously the need to protect the innocent and to ensure that we do not over-react even with the guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A difficulty still arises from the fact that the concept of seriousness is not involved with these offences. We freely concede that there are offences that no one would wish to argue were anything other than serious—for example, those involving £1 million, although I cannot remember how £1 million is defined by Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it depends on the clause. Most Opposition Members would regard offences involving £1 million—whether under this clause or previous clauses—as something more than a bagatelle. We concede that some offences are, by definition, serious and that there is no need to use the term. However, it is a matter for concern that a group of individuals will have, if not a general power of arrest, a power that is not well-defined in terms of specific cases and that that can be operated even when there may be considerable concern about whether the offence is serious and warrants its use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we accept that there is little point in pursuing the matter on amendment No. 22, we shall not press it to a vote. However, we wish the Chief Secretary to recognise that we are still uneasy about the precise balance that is struck on this important matter in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As we see in clause 11(4), the courts have no discretion in regard to the application of any particular penalty. Under clause 23, the commissioners
	<br><blockquote><p>"may, as they see fit, mitigate or remit any penalty, interest or surcharge for which a person is liable under sections 12 to 18 above."</p></blockquote>
It would be up to them to decide to take action under clause 11 as well. However, that discretion would not be extended to the courts, which could lead to an odd situation. Not only would the commissioners have more powers than the courts, which is arguably unsatisfactory in itself, but the commissioners might even be able
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
to operate a system of plea bargaining. With the courts unable to exercise any discretion, an individual appearing before them would be faced with the prospect of either a total win or a total defeat. But if he were prepared to negotiate with the commissioners, a compromise might be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would put the individual in an invidious position, one that is well defined in the "mathematics of gain" theory by a simple series of decision rules called "the prisoner's dilemma". In any event, most of us feel on principle that the courts ought to have discretion in the fixing of penalties so that they can take the circumstances into account, whether or not they relate to "serious" or "fraudulent" offences. We should also bear in mind that, in an earlier debate, the Minister of State pointed out that when Customs and Excise is being dealt with the practice has always been to go for permissive rather than mandatory legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Sixth schedule to the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I detain the Committee briefly on a not unimportant part of the schedule?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members who have spent too many years in the nightclubs and fleshpots of this great city are evidently having difficulty in hearing what Opposition Members say, so I shall try to speak a little louder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule seeks to re-enact section 39 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983. Subsection (3) on page 108 says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person's conduct during any specified period must have involved the commission by him of one or more offences under the preceding provisions of this section, then, whether or not the particulars of that offence or those offences are known, he shall, by virtue of this subsection, be guilty of an offence".</p></blockquote>
That is a strange beast. We have no evidence of a tangible or objective crime but only a surmise based on the fact that the person's conduct
	<br><blockquote><p>"must have involved the commission by him of one or more offences".</p></blockquote>
That is a draconian power. I am told that there is no parallel for that section in the Inland Revenue's current powers. Will the powers given to Customs and Excise by this year's Finance Bill be extended to the Inland Revenue when it is brought into next year's Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Chief Secretary say whether section 39 of the 1983 Act has ever been used since it came into force in 1983, or earlier, if it existed in any form before that date? If it has, under which circumstances was a power of surmise brought into operation and how does the Chief Secretary envisage it being brought to bear against individuals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to draw attention to the matter. He is also right to draw attention to the fact that all that schedule 6 attempts to do is to reproduce section 39 of the principal Act for the benefit of those who have the misfortune to have to study our fiscal legislation, which is unbearably long and complex. They can refer to schedule 6 instead of having to refer to the principal Act. In fact, the principal Act, the Value Added Tax Act 1983, reproduces a provision first enacted in 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to bore the Committee with personal reminiscences, but I remember the introduction of that legislation. The provision which we are discussing is not something new. It has been with us ever since the introduction of a VAT code. The thinking behind it was that when the conduct of a registered trader raised a strong presumption of fraud, Customs and Excise could not always pinpoint the precise moment when the trader had fraudulently not failed to fulfil his obligations of the VAT code. The court should be empowered, on proper evidence, which could be challenged by the trader, to infer fraudulent evasion in such cases. Otherwise, a keen-eyed lawyer might argue that because the precise moment when fraudulent evasion had occurred could not be established, even though the whole course of conduct, such as payments into a trader's bank account, for example, over a period of time, might point to that, it might cause any fair-minded court to presume that that trader had been guilty of not accounting for VAT. In that case, the court should be entitled to infer a breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was keenly debated in 1972 and the Committee on that occasion was satisfied with the provision. It has been in operation since the introduction of VAT. It has not been invoked on many occasions. In 1972, the then Financial Secretary, my right honourable Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), gave an undertaking that the provision would be applied only to cases of some substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts, the taxpayer and the House of Commons have lived with that provision for some years and have not found that it has put the taxpayer into unwarranted difficulties. I reassure the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) and the Committee that we shall make
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
further provisions. I cannot anticipate what sort of Keith provisions on income tax that we might introduce next year. We have clearly indicated that we would wish to present the next instalment of the Keith provisions to the House for its consideration next year. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is no comparable provision in the income tax code and we shall expect and encourage a full debate on such provisions. After all, the circumstances of VAT are not necessarily the same as those for income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>TAX EVASION: CONDUCT INVOLVING DISHONESTY</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 7, line 33, after "conduct", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in so acting or omitting to act".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 24, in 12, page 7, line 33, leave out "involves an element of dishonesty" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"is dishonest".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 33, in page 7, line 33, leave out "involves an element of dishonesty" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"is dishonest to a material degree".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 33 seeks to tidy up the clause and to make clear that the conduct referred to in subsection 1(
	<i>b</i>) arises out of the purpose of evading tax, which is referred to in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>). The clause is important because it creates a new series of possible offences of tax evasion by the use of the world "dishonesty", which is new in such legislation. That is why we and many other organisations, such as the Law Society, believe that the wording is unsatisfactory. The clause specifically refers to "conduct" which involves "an element of dishonesty". It is the idea that there should be an element of dishonesty which leaves many of us baffled. In a casual way most of us would understand that there are circumstances where "an element of dishonesty" can be anything from outright lying from beginning to end to the most casual dishonesty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to illustrate in a practical sense. The clause, by definition, talks about someone who has been dishonest and attempted to evade the payment of taxes. Clearly, that runs from one end, where there has been massive dishonesty is part of the process of a major tax evasion, as opposed to the non-payment of tax—tax avoidance—which may operate at the level of misunderstanding, simple stupidity and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When an individual is approached by the Customs and Excise and told that he has avoided payment of tax, he will probably panic, and make trivially stupid remarks that can be construed as lies. Within the meaning of the clause, that would involve him in "an element of dishonesty". I am sure that it is not the Minister of State's intention, or that of the draftsman, to draw into the clause the type of dishonesty that I have described. Nevertheless, that is precisely where we end up. For that reason, it is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12(1)(
	<i>b</i>) states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"his conduct involves an element of dishonesty (whether or not it is such as to give rise to criminal liability)",</p></blockquote>
and that brings in a wider definition of a criminal offence than now exists. The definition is wider than that recommended in the Keith report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 24 and 33 seek to include words which will rest happier. They remove the idea of "an element of dishonesty" and amendment No. 33 replaces those words with
	<br><blockquote><p>"is dishonest to a material degree."</p></blockquote>
Although my name has been given to amendment No. 24, I prefer the addition of the words "to a material degree" in amendment No. 33 because it seeks to convey that such dishonesty is not the trivial dishonesty I have already discussed. It is dishonesty material to the offence committed. Nevertheless, in both cases it gives a more satisfactory framework than the loose idea of "an element of dishonesty", which nobody seems able to define.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments to find out whether he can reassure us about the meaning of the clause, or that in that phrasing there is an intentional widening of the degree of criminality beyond what is recommended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On amendment No. 24, I entirely accept the need for a civil penalty for any evasion of VAT which involves "an element of dishonesty". That is the point of concern. All the people who gave evidence to the Keith committee said that it would be a good thing, and that there would be a lower burden of proof and so on. The only problem is what is meant by "an element of dishonesty". Would not "is dishonest" be simpler? The Law Society says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We can find no previous statutory use of the phrase 'element of dishonesty' in any comparable provision and we think its interpretation will give rise to much uncertainty".</p></blockquote>
Could the wording not be more straightforward?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has said. Phrases such as "element of dishonesty" will lead to all sorts of difficulties. I understand that these matters will have to be judged by VAT tribunals. I should like the Minister to give us some idea of what sort of offence he means. I have no conception of what sort of conduct would involve "an element of dishonesty" that would trigger off the provisions of clause 12. The wording is very bad, but there must be some reason for it. When read in context with the bracketed phrase which follows it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(whether or not it is such as to give rise to criminal liability)"</p></blockquote>
it is a fairly mind-blowing concept, certainly to someone who has had some experience in a criminal court. VAT tribunals may operate in an entirely different fashion from the criminal courts and may be able to make sense of it, but I certainly cannot, and I do not think that some other Committee members can either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the previous amendments, these amendments are very important. I am not a lawyer and do not have the legal expertise and experience of my right honourable and learned Friend, but there is no question of widening criminality in the clause, which the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) asked about. We have now moved away from the criminal part of VAT offences, which came in the earlier clauses, to decriminalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, all the evidence given to the Keith committee was in favour of decriminalising as many VAT offences as possible. The arguments were that, before this legislation, the only sanctions for VAT fraud offences were those provided by the criminal law, under which fraud had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. I understand that that is the test when the criminal law is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there was a power to compound criminal proceedings for offences under existing VAT law, that could only be used when there was evidence which satisfied the criminal court. Consequently, VAT fraud offences had to be investigated to a criminal standard, which requires much greater attention to detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Keith committee discovered that the vast majority of offences investigated in that way were then compounded and settled by agreement, the whole of that exercise seemed not to be all that sensible. Therefore, it was proposed that such offences should be decriminalised and that the level of proof would be at the balance of probabilities level, which I understand is normally appropriate to civil proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear difference between dishonest actions, as suggested by amendment No. 24, and using the phrase "an element of dishonesty". The second term requires proof of "an element of dishonesty" for part of the fraud only, whereas the suggestion in the amendment is more difficult to prove and therefore needs proof of dishonesty for the whole of the conduct. For example, a dishonest act involving a £1,000 evasion might be part of a £5,000 fraud for which the whole fraud of £5,000 was supported by documentary evidence or a general admission. In those circumstances, it would be reasonable on the civil standard of probability to accept that the offence was the evasion of £5,000, even though the precise evidence attached the dishonesty only to one part of that amount. Those involved might have left the country, and it might be impossible to gain the evidence from elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for using the phrase "an element of dishonesty" is to associate the penalty with the whole of the fraud on the balance and test of probabilities. Clearly, if the restriction suggested in amendment No. 24 were used, the area in which the penalties could apply would be narrowed. Moreover, that might encourage more attempts to swindle and evade tax, which the clause is designed to discourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the debate and being aware of the representations that are being made, I realise that the concept is difficult. Should the conduct
	<br><blockquote><p>"involve an element of dishonesty",</p></blockquote>
be completely dishonest, as suggested in amendment No. 24, or be
	<br><blockquote><p>"dishonest to a material degree",</p></blockquote>
as suggested in amendment No. 33? There may be more comments from hon. Members. I should prefer to listen to what hon. Members have to say, reflect upon them, if the Committee will allow me to do so, and be prepared to return to the issue on Report. The issue has considerable importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "an element of dishonesty"—the widest test—which the Bill proposes, would catch a wider area of fraud than the suggested narrower wording. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
is a clear distinction. Every hon. Member who spoke questioned the phrase "an element of dishonesty". I do not believe that there is a string of legal precedents to say that the form of words is well-known, well-understood and tested by lawyers, but the lawyers will tell me if I am wrong. It seems that I am not, because they would be shaking their heads if I were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is novelty in an approach which uses the phrase "an element of dishonesty", but it does not seem immediately to have provoked enormous response from the Committee in favour of it. Therefore, it might be in tune with the tenor of the debate if we reflect upon the issue and returned to it on Report. I cannot make a firm commitment. However, I think that the Committee knows me well enough to realise that I would not have said what I did unless I seriously intended to look at the matter, bearing in mind all that has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed by the Minister's near apology for the fact that he is not a lawyer. It is one of the most signal marks in his favour. We take cognisance of the Minister's recognition of the difficulty that I and other hon. Members have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cited an example of a man who was certainly involved in a £1,000 fraud and under suspicion of a further £4,000 fraud. Is he able to say whether the penalty would be charged on the full £5,000 in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that if the balance of probability showed that the fraud was £5,000 and there was evidence of dishonesty for the £1,000—the fraud would have existed but the dishonesty would have been attached to the £1,000 part of it—the penalty would be attuned to the £5,000 figure. As I understand amendment No. 24, the penalty would be based on the £1,000 figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms my worries. We accept that there must be penalties for the £1,000 of dishonest fraud. But the matter of simple suspicion refers to the point that I raised on the stand part debate on schedule 6. There is an unhappy potential for the abuse of those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he would examine our doubts seriously, so my hon. Friends and I will reflect on his words. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 8, line 19, leave out from "penalty" to "and" in line 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a degree of worry, referred to in the context of clause 11, that the commissioners will have greater powers of mitigation than can be exercised by the VAT tribunal. Will the Minister say why the figure of 50 per cent mitigation has been granted to the tribunal? Clearly, there is nothing logical about that matter. The individual offender could be involved in a form of plea bargaining. The commissioners can offer mitigation of penalty because the potential penalties are severe. A 100 per cent penalty means doubling the amount that the offender has to find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capacity of the commissioners to reduce that means that there is considerable sway for them to get the offender to accept a higher assessment of evasion than that to which he would otherwise admit. It makes
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
financial sense. An individual could be under financial pressure to admit to a degree of evasion of which he would stoutly maintain in different circumstances that he was not guilty, albeit that he must accept his role in dishonest evasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a trivial matter. I should be grateful if the Minister will give us his comments now, because the matter will arise on following clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would allow completely unrestricted mitigation to Customs and Excise and to the tribunal. In other words, the penalty could be anything from nothing to 100 per cent. That goes against a fundamental part of the Keith committee report, that the proposals to decriminalise should be replaced by a series of civil penalties and that those penalties should have a fair degree of automacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no doubt that certain conduct will incur a penalty. We are talking about cases in which evasion involving dishonesty is taking place, and that is an important and serious matter. The Keith committee report said that in such circumstances a penalty of 100 per cent should be incurred, but that there should be the possibility, given the cooperation of the person involved, of his penalty being reduced to 50 per cent. The Keith committee was clear that the penalty should not be reduced to zero because of the seriousness of the offence and therefore a penalty should be incurred. However, the behaviour of the person who had tried to evade tax would be taken into account in considering whether he was entitled to some reduction of the penalty. That is clear and reasonable. It would be for the Customs and Excise or the tribunal to decide upon the level of mitigation between 100 per cent and 50 per cent. The amendment would extend the range of that mitigation. It would mean that people would take their cases to arbitration hoping for more mitigation if they continued. It would go against the spirit of the Keith committee report to take the avenue proposed by the amendment, and I advise the Committee not to accept it. We should stick to the broad philosophy of the Keith committee on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it remarkable that it is acceptable for the commissioners to be able to reduce penalties to zero.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the commissioners cannot do that. The minimum is 50 per cent. If an offence under the clause is committed, a minimum penalty of 50 per cent must be paid, and then only when there are mitigating circumstances. That would flow either from the commissioners or from the tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference of opinion but I rest my understanding of the powers of the commissioners on the general power that is given to them under clause 23, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may, as they see fit, mitigate or remit any penalty, interest or surcharge for which a person is liable under sections 12 to 18 above."</p></blockquote>
That may be open to interpretation. The form of words appears to be cast iron: the commissioners can remit a penalty to whatever degree. If that is so, my argument is valid because the commissioners have a greater power than the tribunal. That is inherently unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, my hon. Friends and I wish to press the amendment to a Division, because it is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
matter of considerable importance. An individual should not be disadvantaged by taking his case to a tribunal because he felt that he was not receiving adequate treatment from the commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before Opposition Members press the amendment to a vote, they should understand what they will be voting for. I shall explain that to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment and the other amendments that the Law Society recommended when they arrived on Friday so that they would be ready in time for the Committee. When I investigated, I found that the amendment ran counter to the Keith committee's recommendations that there should be some mitigation in the event of cooperation, but that it should be no lower than 50 per cent. That relates to someone who has been dishonest. The Opposition apparently wish to provide that if a person has been dishonest but cooperates in an investigation, he should go scot-free. That is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is curious. We are arguing our own case, but we have no brief, any more than the Government have, to guarantee to argue every point that Keith made, nor, indeed, every point that the Law Society made. What is remarkable is that the hon. Gentleman tells us that we are somehow sanctioning dishonesty because we want the tribunals to have the power to remit these penalties to zero. The hon. Gentleman has little faith in those who participate in tribunals if he thinks that they are so unfit and incompetent that somehow they would manage that power with a degree of neglect and dereliction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that we would sanction dishonesty. He himself is sanctioning that same dishonesty, but unofficially, if it is done behind closed doors by commissioners. As long as it is done where it does not surface publicly, and in the sense that it is plea bargaining, he is prepared to accept it. If it is done honestly, in the fullness and openness of the VAT tribunal, the hon. Gentleman feels that it is somehow a shady deal. That is remarkable. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wishes to intervene and say whether that is his view and whether he draws that fine distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these powers are to apply to Customs and Excise, and given the arguments about the use of the next Finance Bill to give sanction to similar recommendations to the Inland Revenue, it is important that the fundamental principle be established here and now on this, the first clause to deal with the matter. To that extent, it is important for us to pursue the matter to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will disabuse himself of his illusions and stick with his first instincts, which were much sounder when he tabled suggestions without thinking than when he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with my own Front Bench. I do not regard the amendment as an Opposition amendment. Although it is in the name of my hon. Friend, it also bears the name of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith), so it is not an Opposition amendment as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
Clause 23 could appear to conflict with the amendment. I should like the Minister to give his views on that. I hope that he can answer that satisfactorily, because I would not like to risk a situation in which we agreed to an amendment which, as the Minister made clear, would allow the penalty to be reduced from 100 per cent to zero. I should like to see some reduction, with cooperation, mitigation and so on, but not an automatic reduction to zero. I hope that the Minister can answer my hon. Friend's point about the conflict with clause 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the intervention of the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike), because he hit the nail firmly and correctly on the head. Where dishonesty and fraud have occurred, it is extremely important that there should be a minimum penalty and people should not be allowed to go scot-free. The clause provides for that. If it were amended, it would allow the possibility of either the commissioners or a tribunal to reduce it to zero.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general mitigation power for the commissioners which is in clause 23 again, was seen by the Keith committee as an exceptional power. It must be remembered that it was advised by Keith when the right of appeal using "reasonable excuse" was not recommended. The Committee should bear in mind that at that time there was no suggestion that people would be able to plead "reasonable excuse" for any of the offences, evasions and frauds that are covered by this series of clauses.

The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) appeared to be saying that as there is an exceptional power of mitigation in clause 23—which, as the Bill stands, would extend over this clause, too—he wanted to give a general power of mitigation to the tribunal and to the commissioners. That would be the effect of the amendment, but that is not in tune with his argument, which seemed to be that he would probably accept that there should be a minimum penalty of 50 per cent. However, he did not like the fact that the commissioners could reduce that to zero while the tribunal could not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would rather give up the power of the commissioners to mitigate in those circumstances than to make it generally possible for people who were involved in dishonest conduct to seek to get away scot-free. That is against all that Keith stands for. I am certainly prepared to reconsider the matter if the hon. Gentleman does not press his amendment. We should proceed in step, as far as we can, on matters of this nature because what we are doing is of considerable importance. The Keith committee report was generally welcomed. Of course, there are criticisms about details, but I should be sad if the Committee were to be split on such an important issue. I suspect that the votes would be on my side, but I prefer that there should be further discussion than to have that happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that after, having listened to the wise words of his hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike), the hon. Member for Stretford will seek leave to withdraw the amendment. He should bear in mind that we can re-examine the power of mitigation in clause 23. I repeat that I would be prepared to forgo that provided that we could establish the right level of penalties and operate in the broad and general interests of the taxpayers, expecially the more law-abiding of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having sat on the Front Bench for less than 2 hours, I have realised why we have a Front Bench. It presents a suitable target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was impressed by the rhetoric of my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and by what the Minister said. There are two separate problems. first, if there is to be a totally exceptional power, the question is whether it should be exercised only by the commissioners or whether the tribunal should be invested with the same power. It is not necessarily unreasonable to suggest that both should have such a power, to be exercised, one assumes, in similar exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make it clear that there is no suggestion that the Opposition sanction dishonesty. If exceptional powers exist, that means not that there is a blanket acceptance of dishonesty as a way of operation, but that we recognise that there may be exceptional circumstances when that power may be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I tried to put forward the other more important argument to point out that the dissimilarity in the powers of the commissioners and of the tribunal would cause great difficultly and disadvantage and bring disrepute to the system, which is certainly not the Minister's intention. He recognised that argument when he said that he would consider whether the commissioners need such an exceptional power. It is a respectable argument, which would go a considerable way towards solving the problems that I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said that it is important to reconsider the issue and that there should be agreement about it, no useful purpose would be served by our pressing the amendment to a Division. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks are inspired by the Institute of Taxation. I wonder whether clause 12 is really necessary. Clauses 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and the 1983 Act contain a whole battery of criminal and civil offences. I believe that the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) was right to ask to withdraw his amendment, but the 50 per cent mitigation factor is important. The institute feels that those faced with what are in some instances rather dubious charges should be able to attend 
	<i>in camera</i> proceedings at the tribunal. As I said, the Customs and Excise already has considerable powers. Therefore, the clause seems unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the views of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). If certain types of fraud were to be decriminalised, as the Minister pointed out earlier, there would be a change in the nature of the test applied. There would be a move from the criminal test of whether something is "beyond reasonable doubt" to the civil test based on the balance of probability. Inevitably, that means a massive shift in the margin away from the Customs and Excise and towards the individual in deciding whether he is guilty of such a decriminalised offence, for which the penalties are still very severe. We are talking of a 100 per cent penalty, which could involve very large sums, although there would be no direct sanctions in addition to that. However, the recovery mechanism would be different if the offence were still a criminal one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
In effect, anyone found guilty of tax evasion involving dishonesty is branded as a fraud or cheat. Changing the test of innocence or guilt is a matter of great concern. I do not know whether the Minister can give us some words of comfort in that respect. I realise that the argument in the Keith report was that if we decriminalise we accept that there is a different test, but I hope the Minister will accept that the change is a potential disadvantage to the innocent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it is a disadvantage to the innocent. The person who regards himself as innocent and is subject to the penalties has the right to go to the VAT tribunal, and then the burden of proof properly lies with the Customs and Excise, not on the individual. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have moved from the burden of criminal proof—beyond a reasonable doubt—to a balance of probabilities. But if someone is aggrieved and feels that he has been unfairly treated by the commissioners, he has the right to go to the tribunal. One of the changes that we made as a result of the exposure clauses was to make it absolutely clear where the burden of proof lay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in the clause are important. They deal with evasion of tax and dishonesty. We should not treat such acts lightly. I appreciate the response by the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) to arguments that came at him from both sides. It is very much in the interests of law-abiding taxpayers. Clause 12 as drafted is in their interests, as I hope that the Committee will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->

	<br><blockquote><p>"Serious misdeclaration or neglect resulting in under-statements or overclaims",</p></blockquote>
yet the text of the clause talks about repayments. There is a difference between a payment being made and the person improperly getting his hands on the money, and a case where someone seeks to do that but is found out. There is no difference in culpability in the two cases. It merely reflects on the efficiency of the Customs and Excise or whoever dealing with it. The amendments make it clear that the overclaiming is wrong, and put the clause fully in line with the Keith recommendations.

I apologise for tabling the amendment at this very late stage. I had the choice of either rushing it through and circulating the re-worded clause to all members of the Committee or holding it back until Report. I thought that it was more courteous to table the amendments now and circulate the new wording so that the Committee could have early notice of it.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words in support of amendment No. 88.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13(6)(
	<i>b</i>) provides a defence for the taxpayer who has given the Customs and Excise all necessary information, on the basis of which the department should have been able to get its assessment or payment for the taxpayer right. Amendment No. 88 seeks to clarify the wording of that paragraph and to make clear that the provision covers those circumstances where full information has been provided before the incorrect assessment or incorrect payment is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled the amendment because I believe that the paragraph as drafted does not properly reflect the recommendation of the Keith committee. Such a defence did not appear in the draft clauses issued in November, and it was with the object of conforming with the intentions of the Keith committee that the Government inserted the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee recommends that relief should be given where the taxpayer had made full disclosure on or before the day on which the assessment or payment was made, whereas the Bill requires the furnishing of
	<br><blockquote><p>"full information with respect to the understatment or incorrect payment concerned."</p></blockquote>
That implies that the assessment or the payment must have been made first, so there is an inconsistency. If the Customs and Excise has all the information provided by the taxpayer and if the Department is showing all due diligence—if that is not too indelicate a reference in view of future debates—it should be able to get the assessment right and the taxpayer ought not to be prejudiced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the possibility of the taxpayer providing the full and correct information to the Customs and Excise and the Department then making an incorrect assessment, and that it would then be up to the taxpayer to point out that the assessment was incorrect, notwithstanding that he had not sought to avoid or evade tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that to be an unfair burden to place on the taxpayer. My small amendment would rectify the position and would not disadvantage the Customs and Excise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 13(4) is in part amended by amendment No. 79, and I should like to take this opportunity to ask a brief question about the wording of subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) defines the calculation of the amount of tax lost as being the sum of input tax overstated and output tax understated. What happens if one of those figures goes into reverse? The subsection appears to
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
read that if input tax were overstated and output tax also overstated, the tax which would have been lost—as defined in the subsection—is the net aggregate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negatives have sometimes been ignored in the drafting of British law. I hope that the drafting of the subsection provides for a possible set-off rather than, if input tax is overstated and output tax understated, looking only at the understatement and ignoring the overstatement. What does the subsection as drafted provide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that amendment No. 88, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) would cost between £l million and £2 million, which goes against the recommendation of the Keith committee. That report argued that a taxpayer who makes or acquiesces in understatements of his tax liability, or who makes large overpayments, whether in absolute terms or relative to his true liability, is not taking reasonable care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report rejected the view that errors in excess of the objective limit should be taken as innocent, at least in the sense of deserving to escape penalties. There must be a strong presumption, particularly given what we have found in between the exposure clauses and the Bill of tripping the trigger point that errors failing the objective test flow from lack of "due diligence" and deserve to attract the 30 per cent penalty. However, in response to representations, the Government decided to make the changes to the exposure clauses, which include the due diligence and reasonable excuse provisions, and also the clause 13(6)(
	<i>b</i>) voluntary disclosure let-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those changes met representations made on the exposure clauses. It was necessary to devise some form of ring fence, simply to prevent taxpayers seeking to escape penalties by offering a voluntary disclosure at a late stage. Hence the requirement in subsection (6)(
	<i>b</i>) that a voluntary disclosure should be made when a taxpayer
	<br><blockquote><p>"had no reason to believe that enquiries were being made by the Commissioners into his affairs".</p></blockquote>
The Committee will surely accept that. If, when investigations are at an advanced stage, someone makes a voluntary disclosure when he knows that he is about to be nobbled, he should not be allowed to escape penalty, and certainly should not be treated as someone who came forward voluntarily. That is an important difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference to full information without further qualification would serve to avoid disputes about interpretation. Once an inaccuracy has been made in a return the onus should be on the taxpayer to provide full information, and not on Customs and Excise to draw conclusions from incomplete information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that there is a technical defect in what my hon. Friend said, and I should like to study his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) was concerned about the negatives cancelling out. That is reasonable, and I should like to reflect on it. He should not expect an immediate answer on such important matters. I shall certainly be in touch with both my hon. Friends and I hope that they will not wish to pursue these matters further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

a vote. However, I fail to understand why a higher standard should be placed on the taxpayer than on Customs and Excise. There seemed to be red herrings. My hon. Friend talked about inferences drawn from incomplete information. The amendment is designed to meet the case where the taxpayer has been fully open with Customs and Excise, but where they have inadvertently made a mistake. In such a case the onus is on the taxpayer to investigate and point that out to Customs and Excise. If the Minister will take that on board, I am happy not to press the amendment to a vote.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the Government amendment No. 77.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 13(1)(
	<i>b</i>) imposes a substantial penalty on a taxpayer who fails to take all reasonable steps within 30 days to report to the Customs and Excise that an assessment understates his liability or overstates the repayment due, subject to the further provisions in the clause. My amendment would extend the deadline for reporting an understatement without penalty from 30 to 60 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several reasons for tabling the amendment. In the November draft clauses the taxpayer was caught only if he took no steps to notify the Customs and Excise. There was no deadline and the Keith committee did not recommend one. Clause 13(1)(
	<i>b</i>) imposes a rather tougher requirement on the taxpayer. He must now take all reasonable steps to notify the Customs and Excise and he must do so within 30 days deadline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From those facts I infer that there was no consultation on that point and I hope that, as with my previous amendment, my right honourable and learned Friend will reflect further on the deadline. Thirty days is a tight deadline especially for a small business man who may have to do his own accounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tight deadlines may be appropriate where there has been a repeated default and where the error is the taxpayer's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More reasonable deadlines are called for when the error may be the fault of the Customs and Excise and where the size of the penalty for failing to point out the error is as draconian as it can be if the clause is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the assessment by the Customs and Excise may take a week in the post and arrive after the taxpayer has left for two or three weeks' holiday. On his return he will have only a few days to contact his accountant, establish the correct figures and report back to the Customs and Excise. If he falls outside the tight deadline he renders himself liable to the rigours of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may not be obvious to a small business proprietor that an assessment is understated. If he assumes that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
is correct and forwards it by post to his accountant for checking, by the time it is dealt with he may be too late. Extending the deadline from 30 to 60 days would allow for postal delays or holidays, especially if the understatement were due to the Customs and Excise. The arrangement would not prejudice the rights of the Customs and Excise. I have no quarrel with the basic purport of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment one starts with the proposition that the trader has failed to make his return as required. He is not wholly innocent, despite what my hon. Friend's remarks might lead one to believe. The trader has started off wrong-footed by failing to make his return. Otherwise the assessment would not be made upon him. The 30-day period was, as my hon. Friend said, included post the exposure clauses because we felt that it was right to allow a taxpayer time to correct a wrong assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are dealing with assessments that are wrong because traders have not made their returns properly. Let us be clear where the onus lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend seems to be defending the position of a trader who has not produced the required return. In those circumstances, 30 days seems a reasonable time. Thirty days is enshrined in so much custom and practice of our tax law that one has 30 days in which to do all sorts of things. Appeals against assessments are required within 30 days at the moment and assessments become enforceable after 30 days. The experts on the Committee will acknowledge that the 30-day or one-month period is often used. I am not persuaded that the period should be extended in this case. I shall reflect on what my hon. Friend said, as I do on all that is said in Committee, especially after 10 o'clock at night. I do not hold out any hope of bringing forward an amendment on Report. I hope that my hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister not to reflect too deeply, because his instincts in this case seem once again to be wholesome and sound. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hodge Hill for pointing out to me that 30 days is considered a perfectly satisfactory period in which to lodge an appeal with respect to supplementary benefits—for a single payment, or whatever. People need to do that through no fault of their own, and 30 days is therefore a perfectly satisfactory period in this case, especially when we consider that subsection (6) provides a limitation and enhanced protection for the individual trader.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 10, line 1, after "beginning", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"on or after the day appointed under subsection (8) below and".</p></blockquote>
Clause 13(5) reduces the minimum understatement under subsection (2) to which the 30 per cent penalty can apply when there have been repeated offences during the previous six years. The amendment would ensure that only offences committed after the appointed commencement date were taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change should be made for several reasons. First, it would be unjust for the level or incidence of penalties to be affected by errors made either deliberately or unwittingly by either the taxpayer or the commissioners in past years, when the taxpayer was unaware of the new penalty regime. Similar considerations apply to clauses 16 and 18, for which consequential amendments would be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, many businesses—even if they have not much to say about their default—will find it a major task to put their affairs in order and bring their VAT payments up to date by the appointed day. With the best will in the world, they may have no option but to pay by stages. It may not be possible for them to regularise their position in the specified time. Cashflow problems are bound to result from correcting a situation that we all agree is unacceptable, in which vast amounts of VAT payments are owed to Customs and Excise, and small firms will be particularly affected. This is a once-for-all exercise, and it would be unnecessarily damaging and likely to provoke business failures if penalties were levied which were partly retrospective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each of the clauses imposes penalties the incidence and size of which depend on the trader's degree of
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
compliance in previous periods. Higher penalties are applicable in cases where there have been several defaults in previous years. Unless a specific provision is made to exclude such defaults from consideration, a serious injustice will have been perpetrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a trader failing within 30 days to report an underassessment of between 15 and 30 per cent for his first accounting period after the appointed day would suffer the 30 per cent penalty under clause 13 if at any time in the six years before it came into effect he had twice not reported an underassessment of 15 per cent or more within 30 days—at a time when there was no legal requirement for him to do so. If we pass the clause unamended we shall create an element of retrospection, something that we deplore in other areas of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that the amount of money involved is worth the violation of a principle which in other circumstances would be accepted as viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend should also bear in mind the practical considerations to which I have already referred. Of course there is no excuse for not obeying the law and not paying Customs and Excise what is due to them, but clause 13 is being introduced to correct the widespread failure of registered traders to observe their obligations. Although a number will have had notice of the clauses, many may find themselves in considerable difficulties with their cashflow if they try to comply with the legal obligations that they must observe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the business of encouraging employment rather than unemployment, and so it is right that my hon. Friend should have regard to the possibility of the business failure that might come about as a result of having to pay Customs and Excise large sums of money that are beyond the ability of an individual trader to find within the time period laid down without incurring additional penalties. Many businesses will need to raise extra capital and to negotiate borrowing, provide extra security, and make changes in their pricing structure. They may also need to phase in the speeding up of their payments. It is in the interests of Customs and Excise and the business community to achieve that with the maximum of good will and the minimum of disruption and business failures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to my hon. Friend to avoid that retrospection and to minimise the difficulty caused to businesses and so maximise, rather than minimise, employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has properly raised the issue of retrospection, which causes concern on both sides of the Committee. If experience is any guide, the House is always reluctant to agree to any retrospection in tax matters and certainly where it involves imposing a tax. There would be a different view if the retrospection involved tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that the provision involve no retrospection. Offences or misdemeanours that take place before Royal Assent, or even before the appointed day, will not be totted up and used against the taxpayer.

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 13(6)(
	<i>a</i>) provides a defence for the taxpayer who can satisfy Customs and Excise or the VAT tribunal that he
	<br><blockquote><p>"exercised all due diligence and … there is a reasonable excuse for the conduct."</p></blockquote>
My amendment seeks to delete the first part of the double test that is the all due diligence requirement, and there is a long list of largely consequential amendments that would be necessary if amendment No. 13 were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence which is provided in clause 13(6) was also not in the exposure clauses. I congratulate my hon. Friend on introducing that provision into the Bill because it constitutes a major improvement. However, if the taxpayer has a reasonable excuse and can demonstrate it, he should, in all fairness, be excused. Not only is the "all due diligence" part of the test unnecessary; it is also difficult to prove, especially for a small business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend say whether the "all due diligence" requirement includes chasing the firm's accountants, for instance, when they are slow to prepare and send in a return? I can imagine many such instances. An undue burden may be placed upon the taxpayer at a time when the Government are making great play of their policies to reduce the degree of tax burdens on businesses, particularly small businesses, and the Government's proposal seems to go the other way. That point has been raised by the Law Society, which says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Due diligence' is not a phrase which has any established meaning in English law."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society wonders how the taxpayer could have exercised all due diligence without having a reasonable excuse for his conduct, and vice versa. Also, the society thinks the wording in the clause is certain to give rise to confusion and litigation. The "all due diligence" test is otiose and might introduce a certain ambiguity and go against an undeserving taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 87 deals with a slightly different matter. It seeks to clarify the words, "reasonable excuse" in the defence in subsection (6)(
	<i>a</i>). I think that the amendment will give effect to the recommendation put forward by the Keith committee in paragraph 18.4.14, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would also be appropriate, in our view, that an understatement or overclaim would not fall to be regarded as gross negligence if the relevant tax return was made in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time".</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend can assure me that the point put forward by the Keith committee is met by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 draws attention to the requirement in clause 15, line 25, that the taxpayer exercises due diligence and not "all" due diligence. I wonder to what extent partial, rather than all, due diligence will be a test or whether the clause needs a technical correction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tabled six amendments within the group. I do not understand how someone, if he had exercised due diligence, would not have a reasonable excuse. I am not sure about the vice versa. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) that the subsection is welcome. My hon. Friend quoted paragraph 18.4.12 from the Keith report. That same paragraph uses the words, "reasonable care". The report also states that:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We hesitate to say that a taxpayer using reasonable care never makes a mistake in his tax affairs, but we do not think that a taxpayer who persistently either understates his tax liability or over claims VAT repayments, or makes or acquiesces in understatements of his tax liability or makes over claims … can be said to be taking reasonable care."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society suggested the words "reasonable care", and it seems to be more straightforward than the complicated formula that we have now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the brief argument put forward by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It is difficult to argue the need for the watertight test of "all due diligence", which is an almost impossible test if taken to its final conclusion. If all due diligence has been exercised, it is difficult to see how there can be a reason. If there has been a failure to exercise all due diligence, and that is the test, there cannot be a "reasonable excuse". Therefore, it is more satisfactory to words such as "reasonable care".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall draw a parallel with Government amendment No. 77 which withdrew the words "took no steps" and replaced them with,
	<br><blockquote><p>"did not, within the period there referred to, take all such steps as were reasonable."</p></blockquote>
We have already accepted that the idea of "such steps as were reasonable" is not an unreasonable test of the individual. The Minister should make it clear what the impact of the words "all due diligence" will be and how that will be interpreted when it comes variously to the commissioners or to the tribunal in a way that would not be the case if we reduced the level of the test. I accept that that would be a reduction in the level of the test to "taking reasonable care". Who would fall foul of one, who would not fall foul of the other, and what would be the consequences.?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is a probing amendment, but the hon. Member for Beaconsfield may not see it that way, although I suspect that he does. It is important that we examine what the Bill seeks to do with those words, which could not be achieved more satisfactorily with slightly different words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are certainly venturing into the legal quicksands. I am not sure that quicksands is the right expression, but some of the lawyers will appreciate that the words "all due diligence" are now in Bills which are under consideration by the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that in the Anatomy Act 1984 those words appear in section 11 (3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"All reasonable precautions and exercise all due dilgence."</p></blockquote>
As far as one can track down, there are references in Halsbury and appropriate legal precedents for the phrase "all due diligence."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I am grateful for the references made for the inclusion of the "reasonable excuse" provision coupled with "all due diligence". That has been included as a result of representations that have been made. Those words were not recommended by Keith, but, if one looks at volume 4 of Keith, because matters have moved on since then, one finds that the words "all due diligence" begin to appear. Therefore, it is a legal minefield for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular formulation which has been used, "all due diligence" coupled with "reasonable excuse", was
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
the formulation preferred by Keith in volume 4 of his report. But in volumes 1 and 2, he was opposed to the concept of having an appeal of any sort. We have taken that a stage further and introduced the possibility of appeal, and it is now suggested that the "all due diligence" and "reasonable excuse" provision should be respected. There are a number of different formulations on the amendment paper to choose from, all of which seek either "due diligence" or "reasonable excuse". My hon. Friend's amendment seeks to delete "all due diligence" and leave it purely as "reasonable excuse".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, there are precedents in legislation now before the House. The clause is similar to clause 20 of the Food and Environment Protection Bill, and clause 102 of the Transport Bill has the same legal formulation. It would be a pity to degrade the level of conduct that we expect from people in their tax affairs. I think that it was perfectly proper to go beyond the recommendations of the Keith report in making provision for "reasonable excuse" to be taken into account either by the commissioners or by the tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formulation, "all due diligence" and "reasonable excuse" has not been hallowed in law over many centuries, as I have said. But it began to be hallowed last year when it was included in a Bill which was accepted by both Houses of Parliament and is now law. I am prepared to reconsider the formulations in the light of what has been said. I should be very reluctant to give way now. I should like to reflect on the matter and see how strong views are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider the Keith report in the round. It recommended a package, which should be taken in its entirety. Most of the people who commented on the Keith report agreed with that. The package includes measures of considerable benefit to taxpayers and others which would put pressure on them. The Government and the Opposition have broadly accepted the report, and many people outside Parliament have accepted it. Now that we propose to enact it, people are saying, "I should like this little bit amended", or "I should like that", but it is always in one direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have rightly moved a little way to tilt the balance in favour of the taxpayer. Some of the speeches in Committee this evening have referred to that. But I hope that the Committee will not push the balance too far, because it is important to see the package in the round. In that light, I ask my hon. Friend not to press his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly reflect on what has been said, and any change that is made must be consistent throughout the clauses. I am prepared to listen to any comments from hon. Members now or any representations on the matter that may be made in the next few weeks. I appreciate that it is a very important matter. I hope that the Committee will appreciate my wish not to disturb that fundamental balance and that the balance is perhaps best served by retaining "all due diligence" and "reasonable excuse". The two phrases combined are needed in order to be relieved of the penalties implicit in so many of the clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister would not wish to chide us over much for performing our role of trying to examine the Bill, if for no other reason than if we ceased to do so there would be no need for the array of talent on the Government Front Bench.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
There would be seveal redundancies. Perhaps the Minister is trying to dissuade our efforts so that he has more time to consider the issues in depth. But I do not intend to be unkind to the Minister. We are making a little progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems clear that the Keith committee laid its hands on the Anatomy Act 1984—perhaps between volume 2 and volume 3—because something had been learnt. The Minister seemed to recognise that our anxiety was not so much about the form of words as about the fact that representations had been made about the uncertainty of their interpretation. I take little reassurance from the contention that the progress through the House of Transport Bill represented all that is best when that measure and many others are difficult to interpret, especially in terms of the phrase "all due diligence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I will wish to spend considerable time before Report examining the finer points of the implementation of the Anatomy Act 1984 to determine how the phrase "all due diligence" was interpreted there, as it will make a considerable difference to how the matter is considered on this measure.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clause. It is well balanced, and I welcome the way in which the Minister has approached the discussion on the Keith report. I have only one regret—that we did not take the one further logical step of moving this year towards a technical Finance Bill which included the Keith recommendations. I hope that my hon. Friend will reflect on the need to do exactly that for the Keith recommendations in volumes 3 and 4, which I assume we shall consider next year, and for some other technical matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause represents an important move from decriminalisation into civil penalties. Will my hon. Friend tell us how he envisages the move will affect the way in which Customs and Excise follows up VAT evasion? There is increasing anxiety about the amount of systematic evasion of VAT. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will tell us briefly whether the change in penalties will lead to a change in the methods used by Customs and Excise for following up evasion and fraud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to touch briefly on a matter of concern to find out what lies behind the Minister's thinking. I understand that clause 14(6) will enable the Treasury to increase the penalties chargeable by statutory instrument. Will the Minister confirm whether that will be subject to the negative annulment process? I believe that the process of statutory instruments is new in English law. They apply in clause 16, too. We are worried that statutory instruments may be slipped through more or less on the nod late at night without people being greatly aware of them. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister told us how those various upratings will take place over time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that subsection (6) refers to the negative procedure. That is in tune with the Customs and Excise practice on so many other matters when regular uprating takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar) asked about how the Customs and Excise would follow up evasion. It is implicit from what I said earlier that we are moving from offences being criminal ones when investigation must meet higher standards of proof, conduct and so on, to decriminalising them and having a balance of probability, which will mean that the efforts of the investigation branch and others of Customs and Excise will be deployed more economically. That was Keith's judgment when he made his recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A higher level of compliance will benefit the Revenue and the honest trader. If he pays his tax on time and borrows required financing from the bank or from somewhere else, why should he suffer unfair competition from the trader who delays payment of tax and has an interest-free loan at the expense of his competitor down the street who pays his tax on time? That is reprehensible, and the more that we encourage people to pay their tax, the more that we shall benefit both the Revenue and the compliant, honest and law-abiding trader who fulfils his obligations properly. That should commend itself to the Committee, and I hope that it will agree that the clause helps towards such compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 13, line 37, leave out "shall" and insert "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to the discretion about the imposition of daily penalties. That may appear to mirror previous debates. However, in justifying the amendment, I draw attention to an entirely different argument, which rests on the way in which clause 16 relates to schedule 7 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983, which states that every person liable to pay tax shall keep such records as the commissioners shall—not "may reasonably"—require. The Customs and Excise might say to a petrol station owner, "We require that you keep records of every taxi driver who buys petrol and note the registration number of his taxi and the amount
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
of fuel that he uses." The suggestion is not that the petrol station owner himself is required to keep records of his trading performance but that he should monitor the trading performance of other businesses. That is not as fanciful as it may appear. We should not arm our agents and servants with powers which could lead to such abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because reasonableness is not required and because, as the clause is drafted, the VAT tribunal has no power to mitigate the penalties that the legislation could be oppressive for perfectly innocent people. I am sure that the Minister will accept that it would be ludicrous for the hypothetical petrol station to incur daily penalties of £10, £20 or £30 a day because it has committed a technical offence, albeit real in terms of the desire of Customs and Excise officers to pursue those whom they feel are defrauding them. The amendment is necessary because of the potential for oppression in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayhoe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment will introduce an element of discretion into the application of the daily penalties. The substitution of "may" for "shall" suggests decisions about when and when not to impose the penalties that are provided for the failures, who is to make the decisions and on what criteria. Presumably, the Commissioners of Customs and Excise will judge each case. That goes against what was agreed earlier about the arbitrariness or vagaries of such a situation. As I have said, the essence of the Keith committee report is, so far as possible, to have an automatic penalty for civil offences so that people will know what they are getting into. If the amendment were accepted, it would give a general discretion to the commissioners. The amendment is contrary to the philosophy of Keith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I am aware, the commissioners will not be able, capriciously, to require people to keep records in the circumstances to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I shall, however, look at the matter because it would fill one with horror if the Commissioners were able to act in that way and get away with it. I suspect that if they tried it on, questions would be raised in the House immediately. We must remember—it is an important safeguard for the individual—that if there is any arbitrary action by the Revenue, there is always the redress provided by our parliamentary system in the House of Commons. It is valuable, and something which all Ministers cherish because the matter can be taken up with Ministers, and, if people do not receive satisfaction that way, it can be raised on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will certainly look at whether there is a possibility of a power available for customs officials to act in the way the hon. Gentleman suggests. However, I am sure that he and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis), who knows Customs and Excise, will realise that that is not how its officers proceed and that they are generally a body of public servants who behave reasonably and responsibly, although from time to time we all have reason to wish that they would behave slightly differently. That, of course, is personal idiosyncrasy. After my assurance, I hope that the Committee will not press the amendment, because I should not wish to see given the extra discretion and the extra
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
