	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having spent such a long time wrestling with the intricacies of this Bill on Second Reading, perhaps Members need to spend less time considering its detailed provisions. I have two questions for the Minister on clause 1, which incorporates the real meat of the Bill. The first question is about the nature and number of representations that the Minister has received from insurance companies and how they think that the Bill will affect their interests. During my conversations with them over recent weeks, all the insurance companies seemed remarkably relaxed about the small additional burden to their finances and I imagine that many of them will regard the measure as an irritant rather than a real burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to a point that I raised on Second Reading. Can the Minister tell us more about the record of insurance companies in filing accounts and other documents on time? I notice that under section 22 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 insurance companies can apply to the Secretary of State for an extension of three months beyond the normal six-month period in which they must file such papers, and I wonder how many companies actually avail themselves of that provision. If companies do apply for that discretion, the Department must be involved in a small additional administrative burden and delay, in which case should not an extra fee or penalty be imposed? In other words, should not the fee structure dissuade companies from extending the period, or at least involve a small additional penalty?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the Minister's intention, the regulations will provide an entirely flat rate scale of fees. Will he, therefore, consider the provision of an additional element where delay is involved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is exactly as we discussed it on Second Reading and requires very little comment from the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alex Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). We have had very few representations from the insurance industry on this matter and, as he said, they have been of a relaxed nature. Naturally, companies rightly feel
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that if the Government are to impose any further charges on them they should make their point, and they have done so. However, I think that they recognise that the general procedure in the 1982 Act helps to give confidence both to the companies in the industry and to the policy holders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the record on filing papers, the Insurance Annual Report 1983 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1983 there were 210 applications for extensions, 209 of which were granted, although some were for a shorter period than that applied for."</p></blockquote>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point that it would perhaps be helpful, at least in theory, to stretch the fee a little and to impose a penalty, but we are anxious to legislate in as straightforward a manner as possible. The fee itself is not such as to cause any difficulties to any of the companies; if they cannot afford it, they should not be in business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the legislation we have power to change the level of fees. If there are difficulties, it will be possible for the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Dagenham to be considered again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I want to make is in the form of a long question. I did not want to interrupt the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State while he was speaking because my intervention would have been rather longer than usual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This short Bill extends to insurance the Government's policy that where a service is given or an activity carried out in conjunction with an identifiable group, the costs should be recovered from that group where practicable."—
	<i>[Official Report, Second Reading Committee.</i> 28Februaryl985;c.3.]</p></blockquote>
How do Government Departments cost the services on which a price is constructed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in this because Government Departments—and local authorities—seem to clutch charges and figures out of the air. Some of the prices for Government services over the years have been weird and wonderful, but when I have inquired about the structure of costs on which the prices and fees are based, no one has been able to provide an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I once had a long exchange of correspondence about the fees charged by the Land Registry for work in respect of conveyancing. The Lord Chancellor explained to me that no accurate costing system existed in the Land Registry. There was no costing on a time basis. There was nothing on which prices could be constructed. I then reminded him that he expected solicitors to have an accurate costing system in their offices so that they could construct a table of costs on which to base their fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary answer this question? When a Government Department has charged a fee to an insurance company—or anyone else—what answer would be forthcoming if the insurance company were to write to the Department saying, "Please could you let us have a breakdown of the cost structure on which you base that fee."?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). He may have noticed that on Second Reading one of his hon. Friends asked me why
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
we were not including a profit factor in the fees for the insurance companies. I believe that I replied that the purpose of the exercise was not to make a profit but to recover the actual costs where they could be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the Department of Trade and Industry a section is charged under the legislation with the supervision of the insurance industry. Therefore, it is not too difficult to work out the salaries involved as they are mainly those of the people in that section. Nor is it difficult to work out the computer and general accommodation costs which, with the salaries, reflect the total amount that the taxpayer must meet through the departmental budget to pay for the supervision of the insurance industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have made it clear that our purpose is to recover that cost and no more. The same applies, of course, to the Companies Registration Office. The task of segregating the cost there is easier because the majority of staff work in a separate office in Cardiff. The whole cost of the operation can more easily be seen. The fees charged for registration are required to reflect the cost of the operation. Even the Government accounting system is capable of identifying such costs and charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to pursue this matter a little further. How are the people who compute these costs monitored to see whether costs could be reduced and the operation made more efficient? Are they assessed on a time basis and is a check made to see whether that costing is accurate? Government Departments and local authorities seem to lump every other bureaucratic charge in the price. What monitoring arrangements are kept to ensure that costs are kept to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
a minimum so that prices are always competitive? I am sure that the Minister is interested in that because cost saving is the ethos of his Government. What financial and commercial disciplines are brought into play to keep costs down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is constant scrutiny of budgets and manpower in each Department and in each section of each Department. It is fair to say that no Government have been more successful in reducing costs in recent years. One has only to consider the level of manpower in the Civil Service which is at its smallest since the end of the Second World War to show that that is true. By constantly monitoring money and manpower we have been able to improve productivity in most of our Departments, including the DTI. That is reflected in the small charge per company that the Bill will impose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
