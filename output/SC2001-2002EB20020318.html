	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Europe (Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not previous had the privilege of appearing before you in Committee, Mr. Illsley, but I look forward to the experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been a champion of enlargement, as, to be fair, were our predecessors. Negotiations began under our presidency in 1998. When the Prime Minister spoke in Warsaw in October 2000, he was the first European leader to call for enlargement in 2004, and for candidate countries to take part in the next intergovernmental conference. We played a key role in keeping the European Union on track to achieve those objectives, because we believe in the reunification of the continent of Europe after half a century of division at the beginning of the previous century—more wars were fought in our continent over the previous two centuries or so than in any other part in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enlargement is about spreading the zone of stability and security, including in the fight against terrorism. We can compare what happened to Milosevic's Yugoslavia, which turned its back on the European Union and on European values, with Slovenia, which opted for European Union membership and stands as a democratic model for the region. Enlargement also derives from hard-headed economic self-interest. It is estimated to boost British gross domestic product by about £1·75 billion a year; it will bring an estimated 300,000 new jobs to the 15 member states, and about 2 million to candidate states; and it will encourage investment and trade opportunities in the world's largest single market of nearly 500 million citizens, which is larger than the two biggest economies in the world, Japan and America, combined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are on track to complete negotiations with the first candidates this year, which will include up to 10 new member states. The Commission will not make recommendations on which countries should join until its next annual report this autumn. Progress is encouraging: of the 29 chapters that need to be closed
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
in the negotiations before accession can happen, Slovenia has closed 26, and the Czech Republic, Hungary and Cyprus have closed 24; other countries follow behind with 22, 23 and 20. Bulgaria has closed 14 and Romania nine—they are not expected to be part of the first wave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has published a strategy paper, which confirms that enlargement is affordable. In January, it set out why and how it is affordable in its proposals on finance, which fall within the overall budget ceilings set at the Berlin Council in 1999. The Commission's financing paper and the paper on the agriculture chapter set out detailed proposals on how money might be spent. We can support much in those proposals. The bulk of the money rightly lies in regional funds, and the focus of common agricultural money is on rural development in support of restructuring, rather than on handing out subsidies, which has been the traditional method of the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can also support assistance in the decommissioning of non-upgradable nuclear plants, which will be important for northern Cyprus in the event of a settlement. Although the remaining negotiations will be difficult, they are manageable, and we are on track to end negotiations with the first candidates this year by the time of the Copenhagen Council, under the Danish presidency, in December. We are committed to seeing the process through. We owe it to the candidate countries—all of which are our friends and with some of which we have had close relationships over centuries—not to move the goalposts after 12 years of painful reform. Their accession must be secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By allowing and enabling the candidate countries to join the European Union, we are doing a favour not only to them but to ourselves. Enlargement will increase jobs and trading opportunities for our companies and enhance our security and stability. We will also be able to encourage strong environmental standards. Air and water pollution know no national boundaries. By applying the high environmental standards in the European Union to the other countries joining us, we will protect our own environment as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the Minister's words in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr Illsley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the Irish voters' rejection of the Nice treaty, is there a plan B for the accession of the states that propose to join the European Union? Will it be possible to incorporate the voting weight changes for the Council of Ministers and the seat number changes in the European Parliament in a new accession treaty without reopening the whole controversial subject, particularly if the Irish voters reject the Nice treaty a second time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a legitimate concern among Conservative Members and, as the hon. Gentleman will recognise, a particular concern for the Government. Every member state, including Ireland, must ratify the Nice treaty before it can come into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
force. I know of no plan B. The only future lies in ratification by every member state, which will allow enlargement to take place on time and enable the countries that complete their negotiations by the end of this year to take part in the intergovernmental conference in 2004 and the European elections. That must still be the objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Irish Government have asked for time to reflect. They have set up a consultative forum to take views from the Irish people on what extra safeguards might be offered to enable them to feel more certain about voting for ratification of the Nice treaty than they were last time, when they rejected it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. My right hon. Friend will be aware that the United Kingdom has been a leading country in giving practical assistance to the candidate nations. We have been involved in 80 to 90 different projects, most of which deal with institution building in the civil service in those countries. Is he able to assess the effectiveness of the projects, particularly those aimed at tackling endemic corruption, which is highlighted in the reports on progress as a worrying issue and must be addressed before accession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have bilateral projects in 13 countries and experts involved in more than 100 twinning projects. At the end of last year, I travelled to Hungary and the Czech Republic and met some of the officials and experts that we had provided to the authorities in those countries to give the advice that they need on improving their judiciary and tackling corruption. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to refer to the problem of corruption, and I am glad that he raised the matter, because it has been endemic in many of the countries. Joining the European Union would lever up their standards and improve their governance. They want to come into Europe, but to do so they must meet common standards, whether in respect of financial transparency, good practice in government or strong judicial authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all those areas, our experts have been working in situ, on matters from advising courts to improving border safeguards—for us and our colleagues in the European Union, having proper border safeguards is terribly important. Britain has played a leading role. We have given support in that way and in direct funding to the applicant—now the candidate—countries amounting to, I think, £350 million, because we believe that it is not only in their interests but in ours for them to join. To the extent that Britain can help provide the expertise and technical assistance to enable them to meet the conditions and requirements of European Union membership, we are glad to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his commentary on the Commission's regular report on enlargement, the Minister helpfully picks up on the point that implementation of the acquis communautaire is very poor in several applicant countries, which have managed to incorporate it in their legal statutes but failed to implement it. That is very serious. Given that the acquis communautaire
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
runs to 85,000 pages, does he not think it wholly unfair to impose on small countries with weak administrative systems the burden not only of bringing it into their statutes but of implementing it on a very accelerated time scale? How will he satisfy himself that that monstrous volume of legislation will be properly implemented in time for accession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I want to answer him directly, but I put it to him, in a spirit of friendship rather than in an adversarial way, that he and his constituents would expect the candidate countries to meet the standards that apply across the rest of the European Union when they join it. Our citizens taking part in a single market joined by those candidate countries will want to know that those standards apply, whether they are business people trading in those countries or are crossing borders travelling into them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the right hon. Gentleman's point that the acquis is a pretty heavy load to bear. However, the candidates will be obliged, by the terms of their accession treaties, to fulfil their obligations under the acquis like any other member state, including Britain. Monitoring and implementation of the acquis does not end with the conclusion of the negotiations, but is an ongoing process to which all member states are subject. That will be the case, for example, in financial services and agriculture. After enlargement, the candidates will participate in the existing European Union peer review processes, for example in justice and home affairs and the various procedures relating to economic reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The acquis is a considerable burden, but I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would not want any member state to join on the basis of weakened accession standards. That would not be to its benefit and certainly not to ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, too, say how pleased I am to be serving in Committee under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Illsley?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my right hon. Friend's attention to the first page in the European Community document, which refers to the importance of a "strong and united Europe". Does he agree that the larger the EU becomes the more difficult it is to keep Europe united and strong? There are problems of unequal living standards and very different economies, and agriculture causes immense difficulties. Is it not inevitable that that situation will lead to a looser association of co-operating but essentially independent nation states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts his finger on the foundation of the British, Labour Government's view of the European Union: that it should not be some kind of federal superstate with power centralised in Brussels, but rest on independent nation states freely co-operating together within the Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked to the candidate countries—on my recent visits to Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, when their Ministers have visited me in London and when I met all the Government representatives at the European Union convention, on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
which I am the British Government representative— about their ideas for the future of Europe. What struck me was that many such countries have freshly won their nationhood and independence as proud peoples after decades of oppression under the old Soviet empire. They are not about to want to give that up by surrendering power to the centre. They, along with the majority of European member states, are as keen as us to retain decision making at national level, where it is best to do so. We co-operate with other member states on decisions taken at the Brussels level only when, as in cases such as anti-terrorist measures and the single market, it is in our interests to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend is right to say that the enlargement of the European Union to take in another 10 countries, which is the biggest enlargement in Europe's history, is a formidable undertaking that will impose strains and stresses on the EU's decision-making structures, the prize of reunifying Europe is nevertheless very exciting, and we must grasp it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that there needs to be further progress in the Baltic states towards the integration of minorities who do not speak the majority language? In particular, I note that in Estonia those who do not have Estonian nationality are restricted in the political parties to which they can belong. That restriction is unique in the world; does he agree that it remains a cause for concern?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not confess this, but my hon. Friend has told me something that I did not know. I am grateful to him because he is an expert on Europe and a valued contributor to debates in the House. I want to have a closer look at the Estonian example, but in general terms minorities' rights—whether it is the Roma in central European countries such as the Czech Republic or the minorities in Estonia—must be safeguarded. Such rights are part of both the acquis and the Copenhagen criteria, which candidate counties must meet in order to become full members of the European Union, and they are another benefit of Europe and the European Union. Because we have such high democratic standards—they are not perfect and we are continually trying to improve them—by enlarging our membership we enlarge not only the zone of stability and prosperity, but the zone of democracy and human rights. Estonia will need to abide by those criteria along with every other candidate country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On cost, the Commission's opinion is that it will be possible to finance an enlargement of up to 10 countries without breaking the financial ceilings agreed in Berlin in 1999. That statement is unremarkable because it is obviously possible, provided that we do not give very much more money to the applicant countries. Those countries, however, take a different view. They do not want, for instance, to receive less under the common agriculture policy than farmers in the 15 existing member states. Has that statement been agreed with the applicant
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
countries, or is the Commission's view simply that they can be forced or bullied into accepting a restriction on extra money to squeeze the process into the existing financial perspective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody is going to bully or force anybody to do anything. The applicant countries are negotiating, and the budgetary chapter has been opened along with those for agriculture, the structural funds and regional policy, which are some of the toughest issues to crack. The applicant countries will obviously want to win the best deal that they can, but we will insist, as will the Commission, that the ultimate settlement remains within the budget set by the Berlin Council in 1999, and we are confident that that can be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specifically on agriculture, there is no provision for increasing the budget in respect of the applicant countries. Discussions in parallel will of course take place on CAP reform once those countries are in. Such discussions, which introduced changes, started in Berlin in 1999. That reform must be completed by 2006, which will involve a tapering off of CAP support for direct payments for existing member states, and a tapering up of support for the candidate countries, so that we meet at a point of equilibrium. That is the objective, but meanwhile the CAP needs radical reform. Instead of just supporting all sorts of dubious agricultural practices, support should be directed at regenerating the rural economy and assisting with development and modernisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his answer to my first question on Turkey, which I thought was very helpful. Turkey is a possible future applicant, although not part of the immediate wave. It is rather surprising that it is included, because it would not be considered a European nation in cultural terms—although it is undoubtedly a fine nation in other ways. Does he agree that it is odd that it is included, when many other nations that are culturally European are currently excluded? Is he concerned that we are drawing lines that have more to do with strategic issues in the world than with the European family of nations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We enjoy association agreements with countries other than Turkey. In the Balkans, Croatia is a country that my hon. Friend could cite as apparently more geographically part of Europe than Turkey. However, Turkey is a country that is strategically very important, wants an alliance with the European Union, and eventually wants to join the EU. It is a long way from doing so, but we should encourage European standards of democracy, human rights, economic modernisation and peace and stability to spread, within reasonable limits, as far as is practicable. Turkey is anxious to join, and we are keen to encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the 10 candidate countries that could complete negotiations by the end of the year are engaged in a process for which Turkey is not yet ready. It is not even near the stage reached by Romania and Bulgaria, which are immediately behind those 10 and have opened the process of negotiating on the acquis. It is in our interest to encourage that process of

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to elaborate on the helpful reply that he gave to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) on CAP reform and agriculture in general. The Spanish Foreign Minister said, quite explicitly, that there should be no debate on reform of the common agricultural policy until after enlargement. The Minister will be aware of the concern among accession countries about raising the spectre of reform ahead of their accession, because they realise its budgetary implications. Should not the outlines of the future structure of the CAP be in place—at least in minimum—when the accession process gets under way? Otherwise, there will be a lack of clarity about how the long-term budgetary aspirations of the European Union will work. There will also be all sorts of political difficulty concerning the vested interests of agriculture, particularly in the accession countries. Will he marry up the dates of 2006 and 2004 and explain whether we are setting out what the lines should be for the future of agriculture so that they are clear to the accession countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission recently proposed to phase in direct payments for member states, starting at 25 per cent. It discussed a 10-year programme in which that could occur. We believe that such considerations and funding would be better directed at transforming the agricultural and rural economies of those countries and existing member states, so there is still a discussion to be had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern, and the Government's strong belief, is that allowing reform of the common agricultural policy to become the central negotiating issue now and introducing that into the negotiations with candidate countries could act as a veto on progress to enlargement and is unnecessary because the CAP regime is due to run until 2006. As a matter of policy, principle and strategy, it is better to conclude enlargement, including fulfilment of the agricultural chapter—the hon. Gentleman will be aware that that chapter must be fulfilled and has only just been opened—and to get that out of the way. The CAP in its present form will not then bear the weight of enlargement, but it will have to be reformed for that reason if for no other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with the majority of member states, we believe that the CAP should be reformed so that support is targeted at regenerating the rural economy and not at wasteful and inefficient subsidies. Enlargement should be concluded, including fulfilment of the agricultural chapter, and to some extent that prefigures subsequent CAP reform. The hon. Gentleman made a fair point. Enlargement should not be conditional on CAP reform, because some member states with vested interests could use that as an excuse not to proceed with enlargement which, as I am sure he agrees, is not desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the Minister's earlier helpful reply, will he consider the position in Latvia, where there seems to be systematic suppression of the Russian minority? In June 2001, it became illegal to employ anyone who could not do their work using the Latvian language, effectively forcing Russian speakers into unemployment. It also became illegal to express disrespect for the state language—whatever that might mean—and for people to spell their own name in any form other than the approved Latvian form. If someone's name was "Hain", they would have to find the Latvian equivalent or break the law. Do such requirements meet European standards? As recently as March last year, candidates who had fulfilled the stringent language requirements to stand for municipal election were confronted after successful election with a demand for further tests in Latvian proficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speculate on what "Hain" might become in Latvian, Estonian or any other language.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have responded to this question already, but my colleagues tell me that they could not understand his answer, so perhaps he will not mind returning to it. Can he tell us the exact basis of the accession negotiations and whether final ratification of the Nice treaty is required? It is still a non-treaty because the Irish have not assented to it. Is it, as he said in the House, an absolute prerequisite for enlargement, or could the accession negotiations be conducted without ratification by the Irish? If the Irish fail to ratify, will there be no enlargement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Irish fail to assent to the Nice treaty, it cannot be ratified and cannot come into force. I do not want to speculate on what we might have to do in that event. I hope that with proper assurances Ireland will ratify it in due course and in its own time, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees. The Conservative party opposed the Nice treaty, but its official policy was apparently to support enlargement, and I believe that that is his view. It is not in anyone's interest to stall the Nice treaty or stop it in its tracks because it provides the best way of achieving enlargement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>The Spectator.</i> It might be possible to consider enlargement by individual accession treaty, having settled the voting, the Council of Ministers, the number of parliamentarians and so on, but it would be a hugely complex exercise. Instead, the Nice treaty, which for some odd reason he wants to sabotage, settles those matters in one go and the subsequent accession treaties are straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Turkey is serious about applying for membership of the European Union, would it not be appropriate in the first instance to ask it to withdraw from its occupation of northern Cyprus? That should be a basic prerequisite for a successful application. A firmer approach is required than that of the European Union, which is saying simply that a settlement is highly desirable. Is my right hon. Friend aware of the support among Turkish Cypriots for reunification and that it is the Turkish Government who are preventing that? It is a matter for Turkey above all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indeed aware of the views of the residents of northern Cyprus to which my hon. Friend referred. They see enormous economic advantages in being in the European Union. That can happen only if there is a settlement between the Government of Cyprus and the Administration of Mr. Denktash that creates a bizonal, bicommunal structure that enables Cyprus to move forward and to join the European Union as a united island. That is our objective. It is not a question of merely saying that it is desirable. It is highly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would prefer not to have to consider bringing in a divided island, for various self-evident reasons. However, the decision has been made that no veto can be exercised by Ankara or the northern Cypriot community against Cyprus's accession, even on a divided basis, to the European Union. That has encouraged resumption of negotiations between Mr. Denktash representing the northern Cypriots and President Clerides of the Republic of Cyprus. Those negotiations have been taking place for a couple of months and started in an encouraging spirit. There have been difficulties along the way, but that is inevitable with a dispute that has run so deeply and bitterly, and for so long. I hope that everyone understands that the clock is ticking and that it is in the interests of Mr. Denktash and his community in the north of Cyprus, as well as of Turkey and Greece, to achieve a settlement, and for Cyprus to join as a united island with everyone's interests properly safeguarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that structural funds, on average and in theory, are available to the poorer regions of Europe at a rate of about 75 per cent. below the EU average. We have touched on the bread-and-butter issues, including reform of the common agricultural policy, on a number of occasions this afternoon. Enlargement is obviously another issue that must be grappled with. How will the structural funds be dealt with as a result of the accession process? Given the EU budgetary position, existing member states whose regions have benefited from those funds are unlikely to be able to continue enjoying them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Member of Parliament representing a part of Wales that is in receipt of objective 1 funding, I am very interested in the subject, as are my constituents. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the existing structural funds settlement runs out in 2006, and will have to be renegotiated. Even without
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
enlargement, there is no certainty that existing patterns of structural funds support will remain in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective of structural funding is to lever up the infrastructure and competitiveness of some parts of Europe—including, sadly, Cornwall, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, west Wales and the valleys—to the European average; otherwise, they would remain 75 per cent. below it. There is no pleasure in receiving structural funds. Indeed, the contrary is true. We all want prosperity in our communities, and that applies in Spain and elsewhere. We want at least the European average, and more if possible. Our aim would be to get rid of structural funds from Britain. We would not need them because we would be richer and more prosperous as a result of the investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of enlargement, and with no additional funding being put in place, virtually all the candidate countries, in whole or in part, are likely to apply and presumably qualify for some form of structural funds support. As a result, structural funding will become spread out. How that will affect us, and what the transitional arrangements might be, has still to be decided. A number of other countries—including Spain, which has depended heavily on structural funds—are quite keen on the transition period being generous. We shall have to see how the negotiations progress. However, I give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that if transitional arrangements are agreed, Britain will be in there if the regions of other member states are to benefit from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was in Hungary in 2000, talking to politicians about accession, one of the Opposition's major concerns was the lack of non-partisan supervision of public media. The explicit comment in the brief is that that is still the case. It states that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"supervision of the public service media by the Presidiums of the Boards of Trustees"</p></blockquote>
is still not properly ensured, and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The three Presidiums continue to be composed of solely pro-government members."</p></blockquote>
That could lead to growing political pressure on the public service media. I know that the European Commission has expressed concern about that. Does the Minister agree that, as part of the accession process, it would be cause for continuing concern?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I thank my hon. Friend for raising that matter. I commend him for his diligence in reading all the relevant material and on his knowledge of the problems, which is valuable. I assure him that there must be non-partisan supervision before Hungary can join. That needs to be settled now. From a British point of view, and particularly following that intervention, we shall certainly keep a close watch on the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As part of the scrutiny for their economic preparedness, I presume that the external tariffs of the applicant countries have been considered. Is the Minister aware that six of the applicant countries have an average lower external tariff than the European Union does now, so on the face of it they will raise their external tariffs when they

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
join the EU? Is not that contrary to World Trade Organisation rules? It is certainly contrary to their spirit. If accession to the EU raises tariffs against third countries, it will undermine the WTO's general aim of encouraging global free trade. Is he aware of the figures, and if so, will he comment on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Scrutiny Committee set out several questions that it wanted us to consider, and paragraph 5.21 of its submission mentions two. It refers implicitly to what might happen to job opportunities if the borders of the existing EU are opened and people from poorer countries with high unemployment come to seek work. It also refers to the impact of cheap imports on home producers, particularly in agriculture. The EU must tackle those two highly sensitive issues. Would it not be useful to link them by buying more cheap food from applicant countries so that their citizens do not have such a great need to search for employment in the existing EU? One could pursue that suggestion at greater length, but it seems rather obvious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that my hon. Friend has raised that issue, because I can lay to rest some of the concerns that may be in the minds of his constituents and others. First, we are, in any case, a target for migrant labour from many of the applicant countries. That is both an opportunity and a problem, but it is one that exists already. There have been difficult negotiations with the Czech Republic and others over the free movement of labour, and we must stand our ground on the need for proper transitional arrangements. That has not been popular, but we must do so from the point of view of our labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards competition, I have an example from my constituency, at the top of the Swansea valley. Two and a half years ago, Lucas closed a factory that employed about 100 workers. It shifted production to Poland, a candidate country, because wage costs were 60 per cent. cheaper there. It was an assembly-line manufacturing plant, in which labour costs were a large part of overall manufacturing costs. At the same time, however, International Rectifier, an American company, invested in the same Swansea valley to create 500 jobs in high-quality, high-tech manufacturing. Labour costs were about 15 per cent. of overall costs, and we were much more competitive. The lesson that I draw from that is not that EU accession will expose us to huge competitive threats— such threats already exist—but that candidate countries will have to lever up their standards and we will have to continue to drive our economy down the high-quality, high-tech skill route, because that is the only future that we have. By creating a larger single market, enlargement will allow competitive pressures to be better directed at improving our quality— particularly in manufacturing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Will he explain the Government's understanding of the treaty procedure? If the Irish fail to ratify the treaty, can we go ahead with enlargement? If not, when does he expect the process to begin? It is now 13 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, but only one eastern European country—East Germany—has been admitted to the EU. Will the Minister give us any terminus ante quem by which he sincerely believes that the first wave of candidate countries will be admitted? What is the position of the Foreign Office?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given an answer. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was in the Room at the time, but I said that I expected enlargement negotiations to be concluded by the end of the year for the 10 countries. That is our objective, and we are on track for it. They will then join from early 2004, in order to take part in the intergovernmental conference that will design the future political architecture of Europe, and in the European elections. I am repeating what I have said to the Committee and on the Floor of the House in our debates on the Nice treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must not put words into my mouth. I have conceded that, in principle, enlargement could theoretically be achieved by an entirely different treaty process. However, it would be a cumbersome, complex and burdensome process of individual treaty negotiations, in which each applicant dealt with all the matters in the Nice treaty. I will not hypothesise as to what might happen in Ireland, as I have explained the position on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question the motives of the Opposition. They almost seem to glory in the prospect of the Nice treaty not being ratified. They should talk to our friends in Cyprus, Malta, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and all the candidate countries. They should tell those countries that they are trying to block their progress towards joining the European Union. By voting not to ratify the Nice treaty, that is what they did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taxation, social security, foreign policy and committing our soldiers to enter theatres of conflict are self-evidently red lines for us.

As the Prime Minister pointed out in the House this afternoon, we can implement many decisions of the weekend's Barcelona Council on economic reform by qualified majority voting. The French or others cannot

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always been—as, in a calmer phase, the Committee accepted—in favour of the enlargement of the European Union. It would be impossible, historically, for us to be otherwise. What the Conservative party did in the 1980s to secure the freedom of millions of people in eastern Europe means that we have an obligation to embrace the peoples of Europe into the European family of nations not only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
for political and economic but for moral reasons. I say that with great sincerity and would totally refute any challenge to that assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for setting out the proposals and providing some extraordinarily comprehensive information. However, I must mention the fact that documentation important to the conduct of this afternoon's proceedings, including the annexe to the European Union document No. 14117/01 and another document, were made available to us only at 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon. I realise the pressures on the mechanics of Parliament to produce documentation dealing with matters of European legislation, but such timing makes it difficult for everyone involved to consider the documents and scrutinise them adequately. It is absolutely crucial that national Parliaments consider fully and in detail the documentation to enable us to have a considered view about what is happening with the European Commission and other institutions of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Minister's explanation of the reform of the common agricultural policy, and its timing, and the fact that there is a difficult juxtaposition with the enlargement countries in that respect. Indeed, that matter is at the core of a successful enlargement of the European Union: there cannot be any enlargement without a dramatic reform of the common agricultural policy and, as a subsidiary to that, of funding as a whole. Opportunities were missed to address the matter at Nice and at Barcelona, as far as I can see without examining the documentation adequately. I am not satisfied that the Government have emphasised sufficiently the issue of agricultural reform, without which enlargement cannot take place. We must have the courage to air that subject constructively. Some subsidies, such as those that apply to tobacco, will have to be phased out if the system is to be more transparent and acceptable in the post-enlargement process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Cyprus, we have always made it clear that we want an harmonious relationship with Greece and Turkey, which are both valued NATO members. We have always recognised that the Republic of Cyprus should become a member of the European Union, even if a solution to its problems has not been reached. I hope that the talks between Mr. Denktash and President Clerides will yield a positive result. I urge that that should happen, because it is essential for the stability of that important island, which is a valued member of the Commonwealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I spent many hours on the Floor of the House discussing the Nice treaty, and he knows my view on the matter, which is also that of other Opposition Front Benchers. From the beginning, we said that nothing should be done to inhibit the enlargement process, given the importance that we attach to it. After Amsterdam, that line of argument was implicitly accepted by the then Foreign Secretary, now Leader of the House, who said that the accession process needed to be simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Nice discussions related to enlargement to an extent, but ultimately they had little to do with enlargement and everything to do with the political dynamics of the European Union. If the Nice discussions had focused on the mechanics of the enlargement process, the situation in the Republic of Ireland would not be as it is. Of course, the problem will have to be addressed from the point of view of enlargement, if the Republic of Ireland rejects the Nice treaty once again in a referendum.

We are legitimately entitled to raise that issue, because we repeatedly warned the Government about what would happen if they packed in the charter of fundamental rights, the creation of the rapid reaction force and the wholesale extinction of QMV, although in the lead-up to the Nice treaty they said that they would not. If anyone has caused difficulties for the enlargement process, it is the British Government and their lack of leadership in ensuring that the achievements at Nice focused on enlargement, rather than on ratcheting up the whole political process. Our position has nothing to do with a lack of commitment to European Union expansion and everything to do with making the process work. In that respect, the Government have failed, for all their talk of constructive engagement. We were very disappointed that key issues, such as the common agricultural policy, were insufficiently emphasised at Nice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we will, of course, support any moves that advance the process of enlargement—I echo what my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has said—the whole process of acquis communautaire, which stretches to some 85,000 or 90,000 pages, has placed a huge burden on several accession countries, with the result that some have not been able to address the reform of investment codes and company law, although they wished to, because of the sheer pressure of trying to fulfil all the Copenhagen criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be very happy to write to the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, in what has been a civilised exchange of views, the Minister descended into hysteria about the Conservative party's view. From discussions on the Floor of the House, he knows what our vision of a flexible and modern European Union is. However, he will do himself no favours if he goes on saying, as he repeatedly does, that the only objective of Conservative Members of Parliament is to withdraw from the European Union, when he knows that that is absolutely untrue.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain absolutely committed to the enlargement process. We have always been in favour of it, and we wish it to be speeded on. However, I urge the Government and the Commission to tackle the problems of enlargement as effectively and with as much concentration as possible, because it is crucial that the process takes place as quickly and smoothly as possible, for all the reasons that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was Sir Edward Heath who, in the previous Parliament, expressed a strong view against enlargement, because he thought that it would weaken what he believed the European Union to be. He thought that the introduction of new members with much lower living standards, different economic structures and recent political experiences very different from those of western Europe would weaken the European Union. It is for the same reasons that I strongly support enlargement. My views are in no way related to any aspirations towards the greasy pole, if there is such a thing. If there is one, I do not think that I shall ever be allowed anywhere near it. Nevertheless, I shall put my view, for what it is worth, hoping that my right hon. Friend will at least take note of some of my points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the looser association will improve Europe and make the organisation more agreeable— one in which I will feel more at home. We are constantly told, or it is implicit, that Europe is one thing. Europe could become different organisations; it depends on the economic route that it takes. I think that it has started to dawn on my good and old friend, John Monks, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, whose colleague I was for many years, that it is not quite the cosy dirigiste association that he had thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
John Monks and many others in the trade union movement have been strong supporters of the EU because they believe that there will be stronger worker protection, better social protection and better rights at work in the EU. This weekend, and for some years now, we have been aware of tension inside the EU between those who take his view of it and those who want to use it as a building block in a neo-liberal globalised economy with less protection for workers, where markets are free to operate and, according to neo-liberal theory, to increase the sum total of human advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I happen not to be a neo-liberal, and I think that that view is a terrible mistake, but there is a tension inside the European Union. The debate is going on. Indeed, Mr. Aznar in Spain, Mr. Berlusconi and one or two others have pushed the neo-liberal case strongly, much to the consternation of John Monks and many others. I have had no illusions about the European Union and some of the problems, but some people have deluded themselves that the European Union is a protective, redistributive, neo-socialist organisation. Indeed, some Opposition Members accuse it of being socialist. I suggest that it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads the Minister's earlier writings, he will find a powerful echo of those sentiments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to many speeches by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), who frequently accuses the European Union of being socialist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with enlargement because I think that it will irrevocably change the economic structures that have been created in Europe. It is inconceivable, at least for decades to come, that some of the applicant nations will be able to join the single currency, adjust to the growth and stability pact, or accept an interest rate— determined by the European Central Bank—that is common with that of Germany and other stronger nations. I think it likely that several existing members will not join the single currency and will take a different economic path. That would be beneficial, because it would reveal alternative approaches, and that may, in the end, present an alternative means for the running of our economy in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New member nations will also bring their own thoughts about how we operate. The hon. Member for West Suffolk has referred to agriculture. The common agricultural policy will receive a severe shock when the applicant states join because they cannot be accommodated within the CAP as it stands. I have argued many times in this Committee that the CAP should be not reformed—reform can either mean tinkering at the edges or something fairly fundamental—but abolished. We ought to reintroduce a form of agricultural subsidy—where needed—that is based on income support, deficit financing or whatever one wants to call it, and we should eliminate the current price maintenance system. That system causes distortions and problems, such as those that Europe has had for a long time, of supply mountains. The entrance of new nations will contribute to that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In today's documents, the European Commission struggles hard with the problem of the new member states' large, poor and rather inefficient agricultural sectors. What are those states going to do, and how can they be accommodated? Clearly it would not work if they were to be drawn into the CAP as it stands. The Commission proposes a system, which already operates to an extent in the EU, of direct payments. In some cases, payments will be made directly to farmers, and in others there will be permission for member states to make direct payments. Indeed, states will be permitted to make their own arrangements to bring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
subsidies up to the level of CAP payments, but they will use their own resources to do so instead of taking resources from the CAP. That already looks like a dog's breakfast, and given that there are many candidate states, each of which will be different, I suspect that the complications will be almost infinite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is going to be a serious problem. One way of overcoming it would be to pursue the direct payment route to its logical conclusion. If direct payments to member states were based on acreage and standards of living, we would have a redistributive system, and that would be very fair. It might mean that richer countries, such as Britain and Germany, would have to pay more to help poorer countries. The whole arrangement would be about redistributing towards the poorer countries, but it would be based on direct payments and member states would decide, according to their needs, how they chose to subsidise their own agricultural systems. That would be sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Britain, some areas of agriculture require no subsidy while others need some sustenance. We could choose to support agricultural areas for environmental or social reasons—there is nothing wrong, for instance, with sustaining Welsh hill farming, and my right hon. Friend the Minister would be happy about that. It might be a good idea to sustain Welsh hill farming because it is part of our culture, our history and the colour of life in this country, and sustaining it would not be that expensive. In other areas, we could withdraw subsidies and let farmers compete on the open market. We can sustain people with direct income support where necessary, and we could persuade some of them to come out of agriculture altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each member state would make its own decisions on how it subsidised its agricultural systems. It would not be a problem to introduce a system of simple fiscal transfers from the richer to the poorer states on the basis of such criteria as living standards and acreages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the problems of economics in the European Union as it stands. The Scrutiny Committee talks about living standards in the existing EU being "dragged down" when the poorer member states come in. That may happen. Enlargement will not necessarily be a dynamic arrangement that engenders higher economic growth and that raises living standards all round. We may have lower economic growth because we have to help to subsidise our poorer neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned present economic arrangements such as the single currency, the European Central Bank and the growth and stability pact. Germany entered the single currency at an overvalued parity and is already having serious deflationary problems. One can imagine what would happen to a poor country if it were to enter at the wrong rate. Ireland was fortunate to enter at a rather low rate, and it has had relatively high growth as a result. The problem for Ireland may be that if it warmly welcomes other poorer agricultural nations into the European Union, it may suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland's living standards have risen tremendously in recent years and are comparable with those in the United Kingdom; in some senses, they might be considered higher. That rise has had more than a little
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
to do with the fact that 5 per cent. of Ireland's gross domestic product is derived from transfers from the EU. If that 5 per cent. were suddenly taken away to help Romania or Poland, for example, Ireland might not be terribly pleased, because there might be a significant effect on its economy. Fortunately, Ireland entered the single currency at a relatively low parity, so it still has room for growth. There is some demand in its economy, which is a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious problems, then. I welcome enlargement, because it will force us to face up to problems that we have refused to deal with for the past 30 or 40 years. We have assumed that a single currency will work; I do not think that that is necessarily so. We have assumed that the CAP would apply for ever, and certainly that it would continue for the foreseeable future; I do not think that that will happen. Enlargement will prise open all the issues that we have refused to face and make us organise Europe in a better and a fairer way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been useful in clarifying the Government's attitudes. If the Minister recanted his previous opinion that Nice was central to enlargement, I did not hear him. The Government used to take the position that if the Conservative party was against Nice, it must be against enlargement. That ill-judged assertion probably contributed to the result of the referendum in Ireland. The people of Ireland saw through that claim and realised that it was perfectly possible to be in favour of enlargement but against many other aspects of the Nice treaty, so they voted against it, only to find the Commission saying that negotiations for enlargement would go ahead anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government really are enthusiasts for enlargement, they must have a contingency plan. If planning is being done in secret, I regret it. It may be that, tactically, the European Union wants to put pressure on the Irish electorate by pretending that it is holding up enlargement. That is not true. Previous waves of enlargement took place with treaties specifically designed to bring into European law the institutional and financial changes necessary for those rounds of enlargement. I know, because I worked on the round in which Finland, Sweden and Austria joined, which provides a good precedent. I urge the Minister to be more forthcoming about plans for a situation in which the Irish persist in their attitude to the Nice treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support part of what the hon. Member for Luton, North said about the enlargement process prompting wider and welcome debate. No one asks the difficult questions, because everyone is in favour of enlargement. In the same way that the single market used to be used to justify any directive or regulation, a position is being taken on enlargement that stops dispute or argument. That argument runs: "We are all in favour of enlargement, so this or that policy is justified." That is not what our constituents think, however. A gap is opening up between the politicians
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
of Europe, all of whom are frantically in favour of enlargement, and the man in the street who, when he thinks about it at all, is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee provided a good list of questions on page 37 of the House of Commons document about costs, implications for people at work, pensions, defence and imports, and those questions need to be addressed. There is a danger of our becoming a political club and leaving the electors behind, a fact that was brought home to me a few months ago when 20 or 30 Portuguese workers arrived in the city of Wells and were housed in a hostel. Workers in some manufacturing plants around Wells complained that those people were being brought in to undermine their wages. Portugal has been in the European Union for about 15 years and its people have a perfect right to come here, but that was news to some of those who came to see me, including trade unionists and others worried about local wage rates. The prospect of the free movement of some 100 million people from another 10 countries, therefore, needs to be examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the right hon. Gentleman says. He seems to take a different view from his former colleague, Lord Tebbit, who thought that the people ought to get on their bikes and look for work. Does he agree that a more civilised approach to the problem is to try to provide work for people where they live now, rather than insisting that they travel, perhaps across the world, to get work? For some people, moving around the world makes life more interesting, but for most, it is much better to provide work where they live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that, but my point is slightly different. The free movement of people will be one of the rights attaching to the enlargement countries. There may be a transitional period, but they will then be able to come over here, in large numbers, as of right. My point is that I am not completely sure whether the British public are aware of the implications of that. If not, they deserve to be educated about it and to have their consent sought. Otherwise, we will meet with the familiar reaction that matters have all been decided by Brussels, that we were never asked and that something has happened suddenly. People feel alienated by that, and it is a problem that we are already trying to address in the European convention on the future of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another anecdote to report. Someone came to see me who had noticed the debate about illegal immigrants, or asylum seekers, and how the Government rightly sought to limit their numbers. He made the point that many of those people came from countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia and were unwelcome because they were economic migrants, but if those countries become members of the European Union, their people would become entitled, almost overnight, to come here
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
in any numbers at all. My constituent asked, as an innocent question, why people who are unwelcome now would suddenly become welcome then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made the point, and perhaps the hon. Member for Luton, North will agree with it, that it is intended that such people will become so rich and successful in their own countries that they will not want to come here. However, that was not the experience at the time of reunification in Germany, when a large number of people from East Germany flooded west in search of a better life and higher wages. We must brace ourselves for a significant migratory effect, whether that is good or bad. I am not completely convinced that that topic is yet in the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point follows on from something said by the hon. Member for Luton, North. Are we erecting higher hurdles for those countries quite unnecessarily? He gave the example of the requirement to join the single currency; I mentioned earlier the acquis communautaire, which runs to 85,000 pages. No attempt has been made to simplify it, and when I asked the Minister about it, he said that we would obviously want those countries to sign up to all rules and obligations that apply to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That puts us in danger of slipping into Eurospeak and saying that something has to happen, that it therefore will happen and that it is a good thing. However, there is already considerable disillusionment in the European Union, and certainly among the British public, that although we sign up to things and have strong administrative systems, regulators and inspectorates to enforce the rules, those rules are not adequately enforced in other countries. If we expect a whole lot of countries that were, until fairly recently, run from Moscow not only to abide by the rules but to implement and enforce them at every level, are we not simply engaging in wishful thinking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman suggesting that when the countries become aware of the rules and obligations of the acquis communautaire some may chose not to join? In Poland, a large body of opinion does not want to join the European Union. I do not suggest that one should encourage or discourage that, but it is a fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well happen. When the public in such countries are faced with having to comply with highly intrusive rules and regulations, they may change their view. As the documents point out, we have reached the stage at which countries are introducing rules into their legal systems, while implementation and enforcement remain extremely primitive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman the same question that I asked the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)? If he thinks that the acquis communautaire is too onerous for the countries to bear, which bits would he leave out or not ask countries to comply with?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we need a radical simplification. It is grotesque that the acquis communautaire has 85,000 pages. Even if its content is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
retained, it can be simplified, but I would go further, and I will give the hon. Gentleman examples of how. Why are culture, sport and education EU competencies? They should be transferred back to member states. We should not only simplify the acquis communautaire, but bring policies back in touch with countries' electors. We should close the gap between the European elite, which passes the rules, and ordinary people, who must live by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to costs. It was a familiar feature of previous enlargement rounds that difficult questions—such as those on agriculture, expenditure, CAP reform and structural funds—were left to the end. Indeed, those enlargement chapters have not been closed. The end game was difficult when Finland, Sweden and Austria joined because, although they are rich democracies that brought money in, Spain, and other cohesion countries, fought like tigers for their existing privileges. The time scale to which the Minister holds is extremely optimistic for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission document refers to a coherent financial framework to be published by the end of January 2000 at the latest, and I assume that that sets out the exact costs. Is that available from the Vote Office, as was promised? If it is in the documents, I may have overlooked it, but I ask the Minister that question genuinely, not rhetorically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last comments relate to Cyprus. The European Union is making a mistake over Cyprus, and we know how that has happened. The Greek Prime Minister was anxious to have Cyprus accepted as a candidate state, and that was agreed to. However, it is not right to contemplate admitting an unresolved quarrel into the European Union. We hope that the quarrel will be resolved soon, and perhaps admittance is being offered to the two parts of the island as a carrot. However, enormous diplomatic efforts over several years have failed to find a resolution, and issues of property and compensation, which affect our constituents, are outstanding. People regularly visit me to discuss their destroyed properties in Varosha, and elsewhere. Such efforts are apparently stalled or proceeding at a snail's pace, but negotiations on the accession of the island are nevertheless at an advanced stage. I suggest that the Minister starts to back-pedal slowly, so that we can say that Cyprus has not met the political criteria and avoid the disruptive implications of the eventual accession of a still-divided island.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

For that reason, I hope that this is the last report of its kind, but it is none the less important in allowing us to discuss the big picture of European enlargement and address some persistent
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
knotty problems that must be dealt with if we are to discuss the actual accession of candidate countries 12 months from now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view of the right hon. Member for Wells that much work must be done to convince the United Kingdom electorate, and voters throughout the rest of Europe, of the benefits of enlargement. It might have helped if he had mentioned those benefits, rather than talking about mass legal immigration from countries that currently send people here as asylum seekers. The right hon. Gentleman raised a spectre, rather than seeking to reassure us, but I am sure that did so in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In equal good faith, I stress the benefits of enlargement, though my views are somewhat in contradistinction to those expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, who holds a well-argued and cogent set of principles in this matter. I do not share all his principles, and I shall state where I believe that he is unduly pessimistic, although only time will tell which of us is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European enlargement will bring genuine benefits that fall into two broad categories—the economy of the EU and security. I will not rehearse all the benefits—we are all familiar with them—but they have not been stated sufficiently strongly today. Research shows that EU post-enlargement gross domestic product could grow by as much as 11 billion euros a year. Our own GDP could grow by £1.75 billion a year. On the Floor of the House, I have several times asked my right hon. Friend the Minister what assessment the United Kingdom Government have made of the potential benefit for jobs throughout Europe. He has been kind enough to estimate that the EU should gain about 300,000 new jobs as a direct result of enlargement. We should state that important gain openly. It is in our interest to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible come to the UK. Opportunities for consumers will extend into a new European realm. That also applies to businesses looking for new, imaginative ways of refreshing their supply chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the broader issue of trade, the new market will contain about 500 million consumers—100 million more than at present—and will be larger than those of the United States and Japan combined. My hon. Friend pointed out the pitfalls, but that is a benefit too, and one that we should state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with some of what my hon. Friend says, but does he agree that some small economies do extremely well without being part of a large market?

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
about one third of Scotland's manufacturing exports—about £4.6 billion a year, I think. More than three quarters of that goes to the EU. Since that would be put at risk if Britain were not a member of the EU, I was happy to hear reassurances that that is not likely, even if the Conservatives should ever come to power. Given the expertise and knowledge of the workers in my constituency, we can only grow as Europe enlarges. I appreciate the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North for workers in New Zealand, but my priority—and his, I am sure—is that the workers in my constituency should benefit from an expanded EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend agree that fears that people from countries such as Poland and eastern Europe might flood their way into this and other richer countries, displacing thousands of jobs, are entirely misplaced? Spain, Portugal and Ireland have seen people returning to their countries as membership of a large trading area has helped with the redistribution of capital to fuel growth. Indeed, we may find that London, in which the construction industry relies greatly on illicit eastern European workers, will face some difficulties when Poland is admitted, as such workers will go back there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We should not say that they are enjoying the benefits only because they have had handouts from the EU, although I accept that he probably did not mean to say that. One need only visit Ireland to see that it is experiencing a rising standard of living, and the same is true of Spain. It is not just the elite who are benefiting, but rural communities, because of their own hard work and because they are being competitive and attracting inward investment. They have certainly been helped by structural funds, but that is no bad thing and they are entitled to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new countries are receiving financial assistance. The Conservatives seemed to grumble about the level of that funding, but that is only part of the picture.

My other broad point relates to the security benefits of enlargement, which include the fight against terrorism, combating international crime, and enhanced stability and security throughout Europe. I shall test your patience and, perhaps, tempt fate, Mr. Illsley, by suggesting that all that will be greatly enhanced following agreement on the common European arrest warrant, which excited huge debate in this Committee a few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possible environmental benefits and the undoubted benefits to democracy and human rights in applicant countries relate to my second point. What emerges from page after page of the documents is the huge amount of effort that applicant countries are putting in to comply with the acquis. There have been some informed and interesting discussions about whether they are being asked to take on too much, a matter on which I look forward to receiving a letter from the hon. Member for West Suffolk. The right hon. Member for Wells has first-hand knowledge and experience and a track record on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a genuinely open mind. We may happily be able to take some things out of the acquis, but those things exist at the moment. We cannot take away from the huge effort being made in applicant countries to adjust structurally their economies and administrative and judicial processes and to introduce much-needed political reforms. Not everything has been accomplished. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) pointed out some lacunae. However, an immense amount of work has been involved, and we should be not niggardly but open in our praise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, applying to join the EU has induced a virtuous circle. Just being in the queue is bringing benefits to those countries, before they have acceded to full membership. The foreign direct investment that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North mentioned is just one example. I am especially pleased that, through the 80 or 90 twinning arrangements that we have in place, we are playing a full part in enabling those countries to make their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
economic, legal, judicial and political institutions sufficiently robust to withstand membership of a free market Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe consider the possibility that, in parallel with the public sector involvement and the transfer of civil servants, a private sector initiative could be run along the same lines, whereby our best captains of industry from the private sector go to the applicant countries. We already trade with them, but the more knowledge and experience we have of the markets of candidate countries, the better placed we shall be to take advantage of the new trading opportunities that will undoubtedly flow from enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the anxieties of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North with the sincerity with which he offers them. At the moment, with Hungary and Poland outside the EU, my constituency is losing manufacturing, shipbuilding and electronics jobs to them. We are losing those jobs not because those countries have high socialist principles on wages and terms and conditions, but because they do not pay the wages that we pay in this country and in some cases do not meet all the health and safety and consultation criteria that we meet. I want jobs to stay in this country and levering up wages in Hungary and Poland and attitudes towards health and safety and other matters will help the to reverse the current trend of losing jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is untrue that the EU, with its neo-liberal, pro-business agenda, is going into countries that are some sort of socialist nirvana. I am caricaturing my hon. Friend's arguments in order to do them down, but the reverse is true: the process will be good for Britain and for British jobs. The right hon. Member for Wells rightly said that we have a major task ahead of us in convincing public opinion. "Panorama" last night dealt with a parallel, but related, issue. I took part in a phone-in on Radio 5 this morning, and I mention only in passing the comments of Baroness Thatcher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents refer to the "Euro-barometer". I am not sure what it is, and I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if they know. I do not know whether we need to tap it to see if it is still working, but we may be moving ahead of public opinion. It always helps to make the case about the benefits of enlargement. The more that people are exposed to economic arguments and the way in which the single currency and enlargement will benefit their communities and their jobs, the more they swing behind those arguments. That was made clear in "Panorama" last night and in a recent Channel 4 programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has elided enlargement and the single currency, but they are different issues. Europe could go in various directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>David Cairns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will forgive me if I say that he was the first person to bring up the single currency, so I am following his precedent. However, I am grateful to him, as I want to finish by talking about the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it gives is no timetable, the report contains several paragraphs that confirm the negotiators' clear intention to stress to countries lining up to join the EU
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
that they will be expected to join the single currency at some undefined stage. My hon. Friend may not like that, but I do. There are implications for the United Kingdom. The document, and intense negotiations over the next six months to close chapters and realise accession, will raise significant questions about the UK's approach to the single currency. The time has come to end speculation and to make our intentions clear. It would simply be unsustainable to have an ever-closer union and the myriad different currencies that will follow EU enlargement in two or three years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will draw an historic parallel. That other great union—the United States of America—had the greater moral dilemma of slavery as it grew. However, Lincoln expressed a principle that still applies today: a house divided against itself cannot stand. The EU cannot endure if it is half united and half diverse. Either the single currency will fail and we shall have to revert to our national currencies, or it will succeed, in which case those who are not part of it will have to join the single currency or leave the EU. As I said, secession from the EU would be a disaster for the UK and for Scotland. More than a third of Scotland's manufacturing is based in my area. Three quarters of our manufacturing goes to the EU. To put that at risk by dithering on the single currency would be a great failure of leadership and a missed opportunity of genuinely historic proportions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to all hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. I thank the hon. Member for West Suffolk for the affection that he displays towards me. I will happily do this job for as long as the Prime Minister wants me to, and I hope that he does as well. The hon. Gentleman referred to greasy poles, and I am not sure whether I should report that to the Polish ambassador. I am sure that he was not referring to our Polish friends. I sympathise with his predicament of having to face 6 in of documents without my expert officials to advise him, but that is a privilege of opposition and long may he enjoy that privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a question about a document that he received only on Friday afternoon, and I appreciate his difficulty. I understand that, at its meeting on Wednesday, the European Scrutiny Committee asked for the document to be provided by Friday and that it reached the House mid-morning. I am sorry that it did not reach the hon. Gentleman earlier, but that was not deliberate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the hon. Gentleman's statement on Cyprus, in which he was absolutely in line with Government policy. I agreed with everything that he said. The right hon. Member for Wells, however, is wrong. It would be disastrous to give the impression that we were not willing to admit Cyprus through the negotiations carried out by the Republic of Cyprus Government, because that could affect the peace process that is under way, albeit with uncertain prospects.

My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (David Cairns) rightly asked what the hon. Member for West Suffolk proposed should be left out of the acquis. If the hon. Gentleman could copy me into that correspondence, I am sure that I would find it fascinating. If he does not, perhaps my hon. Friend will copy it to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are in the correspondence phase, I remind the right hon. Gentleman that, some weeks ago, my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State invited him to reinforce his assertion that Conservative Members were calling weekly or daily for our withdrawal from the European Union. The right hon. Gentleman has not had the courtesy to reply to that letter, and it was a serious accusation. I will certainly have the courtesy to act quickly and I urge the right hon. Gentleman to try to provide support for that accusation as soon as possible in a reply to my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Peter Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrote to the shadow Secretary of State this morning and I guess that he would have received the letter in the early afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, which was a breath of fresh socialist air. I am grateful for his support for Welsh hill farmers, including those in my constituency. I agree that we do not want a neo-liberal agenda imposed on the European Union. One of the EU's great virtues is that it has high social standards and high levels of public services, unlike the United States of America, for example. We do not intend to import low public service standards in line with the American model and the neo-liberal agenda that has too often been prosecuted there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government fully endorse my hon. Friend's points about a Europe of full employment, social justice and high standards in public services. Europe has brought much higher standards in the workplace and in social policy elsewhere, better health and safety standards, the social chapter and better environmental standards. Indeed, he was not as charitable as he could have been in pointing that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no danger of our living standards being dragged down to the level of those in the candidate countries. On the contrary, every time a country has entered the EU, its social, economic and living standards have gone up. Ireland is a classic example. Although Ireland has, to its credit, used structural funds extremely efficiently, those funds have really created circumstances, especially with regard to the infrastructure improvements, in which Ireland has been able to transform its economy to a point, as the hon. Member for Caernarfon would confirm, where Ireland has rapidly overtaken Wales and we have remained behind. That was not the case 10 years ago. We can learn from the Irish economy about the effect of highly competitive policies and measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells tried to create mischief about what I said in Committee about the Nice treaty. For the sake of clarification, let me say
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
that the Nice treaty is essential to achieving enlargement on the current timetable and in any practicable fashion for the foreseeable future. Without it, we would be going down a road of highly complex accession treaties with individual countries with no prospect of completing negotiations by the end of this year. It is theoretically and legally possible to find another route, as I confirmed on the Floor of the House during the stages of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill on the Nice treaty, but this is the only show in town. The Conservative party professes to believe in, and has supported, enlargement, so it should be rowing in behind us rather than trying to sabotage it. I shall have to disappoint the right hon. Gentleman on the hypothetical speculation that he invites me to make on what plan B might be. I hope that we shall not reach a position where it is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also asked about the free movement of labour. The evidence is against him. When Spain and Portugal entered the European Union, we saw Spanish and Portuguese citizens returning to their countries, particularly from France, because of the higher standards and better opportunities there than in their home countries. I am sure that exactly the same will happen in the current candidate countries, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) effectively pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells also asked about costs. These documents are extremely full and detailed, but they were placed before the Committee and before the House. I refer the right hon. Gentleman to page 10 of Commission document SEC 2002, No. 102, which contains an annexe setting out the full costs. Those documents are available to him, as they were to other Members attending the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the eloquent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde, who set out a model case for enlargement. As he said, the process of enlargement will bring enormous benefits for us, and one of the principal benefits should be put on record. When I visit countries such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, their Ministers often ask me to encourage more British companies to come and see what opportunities are available. They realise that we have been honest champions of enlargement—on a cross-party basis—and they view Britain as their best friend. They would prefer British companies to those of other countries—I shall not name them—taking commercial advantage of the opportunities there. I urge British companies to go over there and take advantage of the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked about twinning possibilities through the private sector. British businesses are active in eastern Europe—for example, I seem to encounter Tesco stores wherever I go in candidate countries— and British consultants are advising the Governments on utilities, liberalisation and so forth. Yet more could be done and we should be doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are losing jobs now to many of these countries. I mentioned a company from my constituency that transferred to Poland because that country does not have the same levels of pay, conditions of service and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
social standards as those in the European Union. Levering up those standards will make that competitive drain less likely and drive up our quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked about the Euro-barometer, which is a regular European Commission-funded survey of public opinion. He referred to last night's "Panorama" programme, and I was interested to note that the vote on the question of the single currency was extremely close. David Dimbleby assured us that the polling organisation ICM had selected the audience randomly to fulfil all the different criteria in the population. It was interesting, as the "Noes" won, but by a margin much narrower than past opinion polls have shown. I echo my hon. Friend's point that the candidate countries will join the single currency as part of their accession arrangements after a period of convergence. If we followed the official Opposition's policy of ruling out British membership of the single currency for ever, even if it were self-evidently in our economic interests to join, that would leave us as the only country out of 25 member states that was outside it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
