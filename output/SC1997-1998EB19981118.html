	<p>
	<i>European Community Documents Nos. 11048/98, Annual Report on the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development in Africa, and 10533/98, report for 1997 on the evaluation of development co-operation, and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department for International Development on 22 September 1998 on the draft Guidelines for strengthening operational co-ordination between the Community and the Member States in the field of development co-operation, are relevant.</i></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government welcome the opportunity to debate the European Commission's assistance programme to South Africa and the effectiveness of the EC's development programmes in general. More than 30 per cent. of the budget of the Department for International Development is channelled through the European Commission and these issues are of importance and concern to us. We have given considerable though in recent months to the European Commission's contribution to poverty eradication. We have also considered what more could and should be done to maximise the impact of that contribution through the development of the country strategy paper on our bilateral programme in South Africa and of our objectives for influencing the EC's development programme in the institutional strategy paper. Both papers will be published shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is timely. We welcome the recommendation by the Select Committee on European Legislation that the discussion should take place in this Committee. The debate is also timely because the annual report of the European Court of Auditors was published yesterday and the negotiations on a new South Africa regulation and other regional regulations have started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by making a few introductory remarks on the EC's programme in relation to South Africa and by briefly mentioning aid effectiveness in general. There have been three distinct phases of EC assistance in South Africa: before 1991; between 1991 and 1994; and since 1994. Important lessons can be learned from each phase, all of which should influence the design of future development programmes in South Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pre-1994 phase of assistance commenced in 1986 when the European Community began supporting organisations in South Africa that were providing assistance to the victims of apartheid and began contributing to the efforts to secure a peaceful transition to democracy. That programme was vigorously supported by my colleagues, but it did not always receive the same enthusiasm from some Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Too right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman says, too right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reviewing the provision of that assistance, the Court of Auditors criticised the Commission for not adequately monitoring the management of funds transferred to the three local South African organisations, known collectively as the channels. In particular, as the local situation improved in the 1990s, the channels failed to submit financial reports accounting for the funds transferred from the Commission to the European non-governmental organisations. Excessive balances built up in the channels where considerable interest and exchange rate gain were earned. That is maladministration, but it is not fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the early 1990s, the Commission has been taking steps to improve the financial management of its assistance. The Commission has closed the majority of outstanding pre-1994 projects and, where appropriate, resources have been uncommitted. An account has been opened in South Africa to receive those funds. At least £8.6 million will be redeployed in South Africa under special provisions allowed by the Commission, but I stress that more can and needs to be done to strengthen the European Commission's financial management and accountability, and the British Government will continue to demand such improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a positive note, however, while being alive to the serious shortcomings of the channel system that were identified by the auditor, we should not overlook the impact and effectiveness of the special programmes, which the report commends. An evaluation commissioned by the EC in 1995 concluded that the special programmes,
	<br><blockquote><p>"had a significant impact on political developments in the country and—"</p></blockquote>
thankfully—
	<br><blockquote><p>"accelerated the demise of apartheid."</p></blockquote>
The evaluation particularly commends the decentralised, hands-off approach employed by the Commission, especially the first phase—1986-90—during which a locally designed and owned programme was produced that was effective and responsive to local needs. Praise should be given to the EC for these aspects of its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the current phase of assistance, the auditors' report makes particular recommendations. During the hectic period between 1994 and 1996, the Commission—in order to show, without delay, its solidarity to the new regime—responded to requests from the Government for support in a wider variety of sectors than could be effectively managed. The Commission had good will, but it overstretched itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The auditors identified a number of specific problems in the Commission's administration of the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development, including multi-layered and centralised decision making, poorly designed projects with unrealistic timetables, inadequate reporting and monitoring procedures and poor financial management. The Commission's annual report on the first two years of the EPRD also acknowledges that difficulties were encountered. The auditors'
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
recommendations to address those shortcomings are practical and sensible. They reflect what member states and the Commission already know about the management problems of EC development assistance programmes in South Africa and in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DFID is pleased that some measures are already being taken to address the problems, but more needs to be done. To that end, the UK is actively working to further improve the performance and focus of the Commission's development programmes. We will seek, with other donors and member states—through our contacts with Brussels and through our bilateral programmes—to ensure that the appropriate recommendations of the auditors' report are implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key opportunity in South Africa will be during the negotiations for a successor to the EPRD in 2000. Preparations are already beginning for post-1999 co-operation, which we expect to be maintained at similar levels for at least the first three years. The UK is actively engaging in discussions on the future shape of the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment briefly on aid effectiveness in general. In recommending the Court of Auditors report on the EC aid programme to South Africa for debate, the Select Committee on European Legislation noted—rightly, in the Government's view—that it was not the first Court report on EC development assistance that it had considered this year. Recent Court reports on the Mediterranean and PHARE programmes highlighted many of the same shortcomings identified in the South Africa programme. Members will therefore want to consider wider issues relating to the effectiveness of EC development assistance in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department wants to increase substantially the effectiveness of Community development assistance programmes, That is the only way to ensure that the EC's contribution to the international development strategy and to the international targets fulfils its potential. My Department works hard to try to improve the effectiveness of EC aid through a range of formal and informal channels but we know that those efforts should be intensified. That is why we have taken our thinking one step further. An institutional strategy paper describing how the DFID will seek to influence the EC's programmes in the coming years—and providing clear objectives for doing so—will be published next month. It will provide a critical framework for developing further our contacts with the European Commission and the Community in general. We will pursue the objectives directly with the Court of Auditors, Members of the European Parliament, other member states and the Commission, and in close consultation with external stakeholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the conventions of the Committee, and having spoken for about 10 minutes, I shall conclude my opening remarks. I am happy to answer questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 for questions to the Minsiter. I remind hon. Members that such questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. All Committee members are likely to have amply opportunity to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his brief and, I must say, rather general statement on a particularly damning special report on the aid programme for South Africa. When were the Minister or the Secretary of State for International Development first informed that there were monumental irregularities in that programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Opposition Members, we received the Court of Auditors' report. The auditors who are appointed to conduct such investigations report to member states, to the European Parliament and to the Commission, and we received a copy of that report at the same time as others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of previous reports, we have been aware for some time of some of the failings in the administration of the European Commission's programme. For a long time we have put pressure on the Commission in relation to decentralisation, to try to ensure that more decisions are made by delegations in member countries. For some time we have been putting pressure on it in relation to donor co-ordination and several other matters, including the new common services organisation, which is involved in the delivery of aid. Those efforts follow pressure that we applied previously, and we have applied much more pressure over the past 18 months than was applied during the previous 18 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister chooses to make a political point, but I must inform him that the Conservative Government, without much help from the then Opposition, were instrumental in setting up the Court of Auditors. He has still not answered my question so perhaps I shall take him further down my line of thought. When were he and the Secretary of State first informed of the position, and what steps did the Government take, when the United Kingdom held the presidency for the European Union, to deal with matters that they obviously knew were in the pipeline?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the hon. Lady's specific point about the UK presidency, which was a great success during the first six months of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I offer no apology for making political points. I was elected as a Labour Member and I represent a Labour Government, who are doing extremely well. They are taking positive steps in Europe rather than indulging in the negative carping that we heard from the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), among others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We achieved all our objectives during our presidency. We achieved the completion of the Lomé mandate, we followed up the poverty resolution and the gender resolution, and we ensured that evaluation was properly put on the agenda for the first time, which has ensured that the Commission's programme is properly evaluated. We have also applied pressure in relation to poverty elimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, part of our main aim is to secure a more efficient and effective distribution of European Commission aid, which we want to be more poverty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
oriented. Currently, 70 per cent. of Britain's bilateral aid goes to help the least-developed countries, but only about 40 per cent. of the Commission's aid does so, and it is important that we reverse that. As I said earlier, we want more decentralisation to delegations in member countries. Along with France and other member countries we pressed for the common services organisation, which will improve the delivery of aid. Much pressure has been applied, although we have not yet been completely successful: we have to get other countries to accept the proposal, which they are increasingly doing, and we have to get the Commission, which is responsible for administration, to do so. However, we are getting things moving in the right direction and are certainly doing that more effectively than previous Administrations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must express my general support for the statement of my hon. Friend the Minister, who gave a fair summary of the current position. My concern is about the future. Previously, substantial sums of money were not delivered effectively or on time, which meant that at the other end of the pipeline people who are in need have not received the sums that they should have received. Given that an enormous proportion of the British Government's spending in such areas goes through the Commission, will the Government keep their own check on Commission spending in those areas? Will the Government try to ensure that the money is delivered on time to the right people and is well spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his general comments, and for his specific question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are taking a number of specific steps to improve effectiveness. We are providing "secondees", or detached national experts, in key areas. We believe that "secondees", 19 of which are now seconded, will help to improve delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have regular contact with experts and senior staff—for example, at Director-General for Development meetings. During the past 18 months we have raised at such meetings the kind of points raised by my hon. Friend. Our representatives raise such matters regularly on the six or eight management committees in which we actively participate. Moreover, we have put the issue on the agenda of the next Development Council meeting, to be held on 30 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our presidency, we set a policy framework for discussion in the Development Council, and that is being followed up. Moreover, we have supported the streamlining of the Commission's procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Opposition members of the Committee will agree, as Labour members doubtless do, that our institutional strategy paper—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst laughs, but he was singularly ineffective in all his dealings with the European Community, as we know to our cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our institutional strategy paper, which will be published shortly, will set out 18 clear objectives. I shall ensure that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) will be one of the first to receive a copy of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
In relation to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham's earlier comments, we received the Court of Auditors' report on 19 June. As I said, the purpose of the Court of Auditors is to produce such reports, to examine related matters and to make recommendations. The point is that we accept its key recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Jenny Tonge 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond Park)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am revealing my inexperience, but will the Minister explain why the process takes so long? The British Government have helped the Court of Auditors over many years—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The European Union is ours—it is not a foreign country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain why it took two years for us to see the 1996 Court of Auditors' report? Can he also explain the relationship between that report and the 1997 development co-operation report? Why has the Committee been given two reports? I am not sure whether one follows the other, or whether one implements the suggestions of the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Lady, I support the European Community. She is right—it is not a foreign organisation, but one of which we are a part. That is why we are having this debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Lady, I am both a strong enthusiast of the European Union and a critic of its overly cumbersome and bureaucratic structures. Indeed, it is our enthusiasm for the principle of European co-operation that renders our criticisms the more compelling. It is because of those criticisms that the Government are making the 18 recommendations that Conservative Members are so quick to deride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to speed things up; to try to reduce bureaucracy; to ensure that the Court of Auditors' recommendations are implemented; to decentralise; and to have a common delivery organisation. It is wrong to have three directorates, with the accompanying regulations for delivery of aid. It is wrong that aid should be dealt with by different sections of the Commission. We have told the Commission that we want to achieve more effective delivery of aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are one of 15 countries; we need the support of other countries and of Members of the European Parliament to effect decisions in the European Community. I was in Brussels the week before last, where I asked members of the Development committee, of the Budget committee and of the Foreign Affairs committee to support the British Government's objective of making the Commission's programme more poverty oriented, more devolved and more effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example of mismanagement in the report is not unique. Coincidentally, the sums involved for 1996–97 are almost the same as for Conservative party campaign expenditure in those years, which had not effect. Does my hon. Friend agree that we should concentrate on making the programme more effective to reinforce the miracle of democracy and tolerance that has taken place in South Africa and that we should ensure that the priority that the European Union understandably gives to the Mediterranean does not marginalise that critical support effort?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall certainly support a further increase in Commission expenditure in South Africa. Although it is a middle-income country, it has huge problems, which are legacies of apartheid, such as great poverty, almost exclusively among black people. We therefore want the programme to be developed. We want to ensure that, notwithstanding the important programme in the Mediterranean or enlargement, programmes for countries such as South Africa continue at least at the present level, and preferably increase. We are discussing with the South African Government the areas in which that can be done. I can give my hon. Friend more details of areas such as health care, in the delivery of which our country leads the European Commission. In several other aspects, such as basic education, especially in black areas, and in building up capacity, we shall provide additional support. Both in our bilateral programmes and in the European Commission programmes, we shall continue to develop those matters. I assure my hon. Friend that, notwithstanding all the other pressures of the Mediterranean and of enlargement, we shall try to ensure that the Commission's programme for South Africa is maintained at least at the represent level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister take any pride in a programme that constitutes about a third of our overseas aid effort through the European Union but of which only 40 per cent. is directed to the poorest countries and that is clearly riddled with malpractice, misappropriation and incompetence? Is there not a clear pattern of misbehaviour, not only as detailed in this report on South Africa but in the Mediterranean programme and in PHARE? It has been documented amply in four successive Court of Auditors reports on the European Union's accounts. Are we not willing accomplices to malpractice if we permit it to continue? Should we not withdraw our aid through the European Union and apply it directly to those most in need, in South Africa and elsewhere, rather than allowing what is in many cases essentially criminal behaviour to continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not been listening. As I said, it is clearly the Government's policy not to permit malpractice to continue. That is why we accept the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and are trying to have them implemented. I predicted that we would hear exactly such interventions because he is consistently against the European Union, and therefore uses every opportunity to undermine it. Moreover, he has been known to be against development assistance. I predicted that Conservative Members would use this opportunity to try to undermine it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, 30 per cent. of expenditure is delivered effectively, but in some areas the European Commission could deliver such expenditure more effectively. When apartheid operated in South Africa, the previous British Government had no policy to provide aid to the victims of apartheid. Apartheid was opposed only through the Commission's programme. When the then Prime Minister, Baroness Thatcher, referred to the current President of South Africa as a terrorist, we were providing support through the Commission, and rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want aid to be more efficient and effective. We accept the recommendations in the Court of Auditors report and we want to ensure that there is no malpractice
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Rammell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should not we focus on the real reasons for inefficient administration of the aid programme? The report identified that the system of administration is too complicated. Approval for schemes takes place in Brussels, but any sensible scheme would allow approval to take place in the recipient country. The report identified a lack of skilled personnel to implement such schemes. Should not we focus on the issues instead of having this traditional and incessant tirade against the European Union from the Conservative party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with everything that my hon. Friend said. He referred to skilled personnel. If my Department can make the Commission's programme more effective by seconding staff who are skilled in matters such as health, we shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to delegation. In most of the countries that I have visited where there is a Commission programme, local delegates have requested more local responsibility without the need for every decision to be approved in Brussels, even when small amounts are involved. That is why we are pressing for greater delegation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right when he said that Conservative Members are deliberately trying to undermine the work of the Commission and the principle of the European Community. Criticism from Labour and Liberal Democrat Members should be taken into account because we are not trying to undermine the basis of the European Community. We believe that the Commission sometimes puts too much money into the budget for a specific country when it knows that that country cannot deal with it. We have asked the Commission to take account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions are taking place and we are pressing the Commission on various matters. Philip Lowe is now head of Directorate General VIII of the European Commission and we are receiving a positive response from him and the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's soundbite seems to be poverty eradication or poverty elimination. He said a moment ago that South Africa is a middle-income country. Can he explain to those countries whose incomes are lower than that of South Africa why some of them have missed out on the misdirected aim? How can we escape the conclusion that the aid is political, as it so often is, instead of a genuine attempt, however inefficiently it may be delivered, to help people in poverty? There seems to be a contradiction between the Minister's assertion that he is concerned solely with poverty eradication when he freely admits that a middle-income country receives large sums of money almost completely ineffectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that such sums were received almost completely ineffectively. I said that a great deal of the assistance has been delivered effectively and that the programme during apartheid was very effective.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
However, middle-income countries, especially large middle-income countries, have large pockets of extreme poverty. In South Africa, they occurred because of apartheid—a system that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) and his Government supported on several occasions. Now we are supporting a South African Government elected—at last—by all the people of South Africa, and who are tackling poverty and have produced a poverty and equality report. We will give help for private investment and growth, to meet basic needs, to provide a social safety net, for job creation, to help the poorest people—the black people of South Africa who were held back so much by the previous, non-representative Government of South Africa, which the right hon. Gentleman supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most people regard the aid given by the previous Government, as well as continuing aid, as a source of pride. However, sometimes, when one reads documents such as these, it is unclear what aid was given for. Will the Minister say whether it would be possible in future, to improve the way in which aid is given, to introduce performance specific targets to show what aid money is designed to achieve, so that when we examine how effective aid has been, we have something concrete against which to measure it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right; that is exactly what we are doing. That is why we support the improvements in the evaluation arrangements that are being discussed because we believe that there has been no systematic follow-up to the evaluation findings. Shortcomings and weaknesses have been revealed, so we are proposing a much more comprehensive and rigorous review. We are suggesting that evaluation should be made promptly and publicly available; that regular monitoring of the EC programme should take place; that there should be joint evaluation exercises on particular sectors; that there should be meetings in Brussels to evaluate the effectiveness of the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not saying that every programme has been effective—neither is the Court of Auditors, and that is why we accept its report. We want the programme to be more effective. We are discussing both present and future co-operation with South Africa in detail with the European Commission, member states and the South African Government to make sure that aid is effective, that it is clear to what sectors it will be applied, and that the money is spent effectively. We accept comments such as those of my hon. Friend because they are meant to help South Africa and ensure that the programme is more effective—not cut, as some Opposition Members would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to paragraph 72 of the Court of Auditors report on exchange losses, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exchange rate fluctuations were a problem. In the early years appreciation of the rand meant that the South Africans had substantial exchange gains."</p></blockquote>
The Library provided me with a table showing the year-on-year rand-ecu exchange rate, from which it would appear that the rand has depreciated in every year in
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
question. If the Commission was making exchange rate losses—and the South Africans were making exchange rate gains—either it was changing money like a hapless tourist at Thomas Cook or it was somewhat incompetent in managing the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, will the Minister tell us what was the substance of those exchange rate gains and losses to the EU? Secondly, the report says that the Commission would prefer to use the ecu but that, none the less, payments have continued to be made in South African rand. Would it not be fairer to the taxpayers of the EU, who are making this money available and to whom the Commission should be accountable, if the money was paid in the currency in which it is budgeted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised some points which I shall write to him about to clarify the matter absolutely because he would not want me to give a reply, off the top of my head or even from my briefing, that was not absolutely correct. I shall write to him specifically on his first point. As for the funds that he mentioned, I can assure him that the Commission is well on its way to closing all the projects and, where appropriate, uncommitting resources from pre-1994 phases and taking receipt of additional funds that were accrued from favourable moves in the exchange rate or where a project came in below budget. At least 80 million rand—about £8.6 million—that was recovered from the channels will be redeployed in South Africa under special provisions allowed by the Commission. My hon. Friends and, I hope, the hon. Gentleman will be pleased that that money will be redeployed to help people in South Africa and that any gains from exchange rate fluctuations are to be realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the fundamental question is whether we got value for money? In that regard, can he say whether he has evidence from people in South Africa that European aid contributed directly to the overthrow of apartheid and that it was of help and value in stabilising the democratic regime that followed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We are talking about a small percentage of aid. The vast majority of aid in South Africa was spent efficiently and effectively. It helped people who were suffering as a result of the apartheid system. The report clearly states that the system of apartheid ended more quickly and people suffered less because they receiving assistance from the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a percentage of aid. We are not complacent about that and, as I said earlier, it needs to be used more effectively. My hon. Friend is right to stress that the vast majority of aid was spent efficiently and effectively on the programmes for which it was intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to the Commission's report to the Council of 3 September, in particular to page 38 of annexe 6 which deals with non-grid electrification of rural schools? It reveals that the programme has not begun despite the commitment of 15 million ecu. What action has the Minister taken since receiving the report to get that critical programme under way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and let him know of any action taken by the Department on that project. As I said earlier, there is a general problem with the European Commission in committing money in its budget for programmes that are not ready to be implemented because the absorption capacity has not been achieved. We are addressing a general problem, which I referred to in earlier answers, that manifests itself in specific projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Opposition's attitude comes as no great surprise, I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that they appear to be shedding crocodile tears over a report that covers a period when efforts were being made to improve matters. The important point about whether this aid should go to South Africa was raised. I believe that it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following what my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said, and given the Opposition's hostility, does my hon. Friend agree with the Court's desire to
	<br><blockquote><p>"emphasise as a general conclusion"</p></blockquote>
that EC-supported projects contributed to the democratic transition and relieved the victims of apartheid and those in disadvantaged communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the second part of my hon. Friend's question first by saying that I agree completely with him—that is the programme's whole purpose. It is probably the most effective programme and it will have the developmental and political ends that he described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has disappeared. As my hon. Friend said, he challenged whether we or the European Commission should provide assistance to South Africa. Nine million people in South Africa live in abject poverty below the $1 a day poverty line. The right hon. Gentleman, who was a Minister in the previous Government, said that we should not provide assistance to help those people—I was about to say that he implied that, but he actually said it. The poorest 20 per cent. of the population receive 3.3 per cent. of the country's income, while the richest 10 per cent.—and we know who they are—receive 47.3 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who are they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An estimated 60 per cent. of black South Africans, who constitute three quarters of the population, are poor, compared with 1 per cent. of whites, who constitute only 10 per cent. of the population. Health and education rates reveal extreme racial and geographical inequalities. The rapid increase in HIV—3 million South Africans are already HIV positive—will make it difficult to maintain recent improvements in mortality rates. That is why DFID, which acts on behalf of the British Government, and the European Commission should be doing more in South Africa and not less, as the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst implied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a frequent visitor to South Africa and a supporter of sending more aid—whether from this country or the EU—to it. It is crucially important for the whole of Africa that South Africa is a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I have some insight into this territory from the South African side. Of the 189 projects, will the Minister cite one or two that have been effective in improving the lot of the underprivileged, and which go further than the general political objective of having helped to get rid of apartheid? More importantly, when the Minister discussed the future he referred to general monitoring. The most important factor is the criteria used. Aid should go, for example, into education, housing and health, and before it is awarded, the bodies receiving it should be duly judged to have a certain potential to administer it. We all fear that in practice much of the £560 million has simply disappeared and has not greatly helped the underprivileged, except in a general sense. I hope that the Minister will describe at least one or two cases in which substantial help has been accomplished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report contains examples showing how help has been accomplished. In education and skills development programmes, black people are now being helped, and in healthcare much work is being done through the European Commission programme. Effective help has also been given in relation to land reform, water supply and infrastructure, and we have helped to make the South African Parliament effective. Effective help has also been given in relation to justice, safety and security, trade and regional co-operation, support for non-governmental organisations and the establishment of a civil society in South Africa, and we want such help to be increasingly effective. Those are the right areas, some of which the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman goes to South Africa today and studies what is happening on the ground, he will see that improvements have been made and that effective programmes are being carried out. I am one of the people who did not go to South Africa until a properly democratic Government had been established there. Although some Opposition Members travelled to South Africa during apartheid, Labour Members did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that not all the programmes have been as effective as they should have been. That is why we are taking the balanced approach of giving credit where it is due, and of being critical where we need to be, including in areas where the Court of Auditors report identified the need for improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I must inform the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) that one of the problems against which we are struggling is the difficulty of balancing the EC programme in favour of poorer countries. We are taking strong action with the Commission, with MEPs and with other member countries. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development will be talking to the new German development minister. Thankfully, a change of Government has brought about a much more positive response from Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to balance of expenditure, I should tell the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that the problem of the EC resources to better-off countries is the result of a decision taken by the previous Government at the Edinburgh Council, which was chaired by the former Prime Minister—the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman was at odds with the position of the Conservative party at that time; he is happier with that which his party currently holds. However, he was a Conservative member of Parliament when the right hon. Member for Huntingdon took that decision, so he cannot slough off responsibility for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have established that only a small percentage of the total aid package was inefficiently used, but that the inefficient use of even a small percentage is too much. We need to improve the overall management of the aid package. My understanding is that the Commission proposes to increase staffing levels in Pretoria by one grade B member only. Does the Minister agree that that is hopelessly inadequate? What is being done to increase staffing levels more dramatically?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, without being gratuitously condescending, that is a very helpful question. The problem that my hon. Friend has identified is being taken up. We have offered to provide further assistance in South Africa from our own resources, or additional help to make the Commission's operation in South Africa more effective. I wish that questions from Opposition members of the Committee were as helpful as my hon. Friend's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister seen the remarks made by Mr. Bernhard Friedmann, president of the Court of Auditors, about this investigation of the aid unit within the EU? He said that, in some instances, financial allowance was made for people who do not exist. Here, the Commission simply told us untruths. He urged the Commission to take disciplinary or criminal action against those people. Why is the Minister not supporting the president in this matter? Why does he seek to justify a malpractice by not urging similar sanctions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has a unit that is supposed to tackle fraud. I do not believe that a body can root out fraud unless it brings in outside people who have no vested interest. What faith can the Minister therefore have in the Commission's ability to straighten out its act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being mischievous. He has no basis in fact for suggesting that the Government do not support Mr. Friedmann. We agree that, where evidence exists of malpractice or criminal activity, appropriate action should be taken. We take the matter very seriously and do nto seek to support malpractices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to fraud, the European Parliament has suggested the creation of an independent fraud unit. We are looking at that suggestion very seriously and sympathetically. At an appropriate time, when we have examined the specific proposals, we shall give our considered response. Members of the European Parliament are rightly concerned about who guards the guards, and whether a separate fraud unit should be created. We accept that they have examined the matter
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
responsibily. They have made recommendations, which we shall consider and to which we shall make an appropriate response. The implications of and assumptions behind the hon. Gentleman's questions are therefore completely wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard Opposition Members' Questions, I do not know where they stand on the principle of whether the aid is right in the first place. Will my hon. Friend consider that? The Committee has spent a great deal of time scrutinising various issues regarding the Commission and the European Community, which a number of Opposition Members want to attack and undermine. The question of whether the aid itself is correct has been raised today, and there is clearly a difference of opinion on that among Opposition Members. Will you tell me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not going to tell the hon. Gentleman anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Twigg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Butterfill. Is my hon. Friend clear in his own mind as to the Opposition's stance on the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am clear in my own mind on the issue, but I am not sure whether Opposition Members are clear in their own minds on it. Certain hon. Members—it is interesting that some of them have been made members of European Standing Committee B—are not just opposed to some of the things being done by the European Commission and Community, but to the whole principle of the European Community. They go even further than their leader—they are not only sceptical about European monetary union and the common currency, but would pull Britain out of the European Community completely. I know that at least two Opposition Members on the Committee take that point of view. They are using the opportunity provided by this Committee—as they use every opportunity—to undermine the work of the European Community and Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee—one of the less antagonistic Opposition Members raised this issue earlier—that aid is going to education, housing and health. It is going to 500 primary health clinics for 5 million people in South Africa, for example. We agree that monitoring is necessary to ensure that objectives are met, and that is exactly what we are doing. I am grateful that some Opposition Members are capable of asking constructive questions on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To continue the line of what I hope is constructive questioning, will the Minister tell us whether he has asked his officials—since receipt of the Commission paper to which I referred earlier—to tot up the commitments and disbursements? If so, has he noted the discrepancy? What action has he taken to remedy the discrepancy between commitment and disbursement shown in annexe 6?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the figures for the percentage disbursed for each year since 1986 if he finds it helpful. In 1986 it was 52 per cent., in 1987 it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
was 70 per cent., in 1988 it was 76 per cent. and in 1989 it was 79 per cent. Interestingly, in 1990 it was 115 per cent. In 1991 it was 82 per cent., in 1992 it was 83 per cent., in 1993 it was 67 per cent., in 1994 it was 57 per cent., in 1995 it was 37 per cent., in 1996 it was 22 per cent. and in 1997 it was 45 per cent. We are very concerned about those figures, which is why—as I replied earlier, I think, to one of my hon. Friends—we stated long before the publication of the Court of Auditors' report that the European Commission should not make unrealistic allocations that it knows cannot be disbursed. Equally, we want to increase the absorption capacity so that more of the money allocated can be used. We therefore have parallel concerns: that money should not be over-allocated and that as much as possible of the money that is allocated is used effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask my hon. Friend a difficult but fundamental question. Will he do all he can to ensure that the EC's development policies operate in tandem with its commercial and trade policies? If those policies do not interact, we shall continue to provide South Africa with only the crumbs from the table when we want it to become a full member of the world's trading bloc and to generate the necessary prosperity and economic growth to enable it to move forward as a nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. A coherent policy on development and trade is vital. As my hon. Friend knows, there have been discussions on a joint trade and development agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa. Those discussions were, unfortunately, suspended in mid-October, but I am pleased that they have now resumed. We hope and expect that a final deal will be presented to the general affairs Council of Ministers at its meeting on 7 December. We are working actively for consistency of development and commercial policy and that key meeting will be a significant step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister amplify his previous response to me and explain the discrepancy in the figures in annexe 6 of the Commission's report to the Council? The figures for total commitments and total disbursements are nothing like those he suggested, but come to 207 mecu of commitments and 14 mecu of disbursements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman and I were referring to the same matter. With no disrespect to him, I had difficulty hearing his question. No one has ever complained of being unable to hear me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many figures in the report and I do not have the specific figures that the hon. Gentleman requested. I will write to him when I have read the record and seen exactly what question he was asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say more about his discussions with his opposite number in other
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
countries on the effectiveness of spending on development?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been one of the principle objectives for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I and all our officials during the past 18 months, and particularly since publication of the White Paper and the reports. We have met every Development Minister in all the other 14 countries on several occasions and we keep raising the matter. Germany has a new and even more helpful Development Minister and we have had discussions with her and her deputy. We have also had discussions with Members of the European Parliament. I have been to the European Parliament three times to discuss the matter, as has my right hon. Friend. It is not only member states that should raise such issues. The European Union has three institutions and we want MEPs to push hard in the same direction. We want all the other 14 countries to do the same and we hope that the Commission will come along with us so that we can change the balance on poverty and the effectiveness of EC aid. We shall not rest until we see the Commission's programme moving positively in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer the Minister to the explanatory memorandum which he signed and ask for his help with interpretation of point 3? I understand that in a previous answer he said that he would contemplate pursuit of criminal prosecutions for abuse of aid. However, he says in the explanatory memorandum that the report relates to past activities and has no legal or procedural implications. Will the Minister tell me whether he is writing off all that money and does not contemplate supporting any action that may be taken, at any stage, to recover the money or to pursue any criminal prosecutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were saying earlier that the report refers to maladministration rather than to fraud. If the hon. Lady wants to discuss other areas of expenditure where there has been fraud, that is a different matter. but the Court of Auditors' report refers to maladministration and ineffectiveness that must be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier when the hon. Lady was out of the Room, if action is taken by the appropriate authorities—the British Government is not the appropriate authority—as Mr. Friedmann was quoted as saying, we will not oppose it. There is no inconsistency whatsoever in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That brings us to the end of the time allocated for questions. I call the Minister to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 9690/98, the European Court of Auditors Special Report No. 7/98 on the European Development Aid Programme for South Africa (1986–1996) and its recommendations to the Commission; and supports the Government's position that these recommendations are practical and sensible and that the Government will work with Member States and other partners in all European Community development assistance programmes, and particularly in detailed arrangements to succeed the present EPRD in South Africa, after 1999, to ensure that these recommendations are fully implemented.—
	<i>[Mr. Foulkes.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a brief and inadequate time in which to probe the Minister on a report that I consider to be of great significance. It reveals that for many years there have been inadequacies in the handling of the distribution of £562 million of aid to South Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister sought to take the high ground in one of his answers and to insult my colleagues on the Opposition Benches. For the record, I want to put one or two things straight. Like the Minister, I have never visited South Africa because I disapproved of the apartheid regime, but I am going there next week when I shall see for myself the progress that has been made in what I consider to be a proud country with a great future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money was distributed over a period of 10 years, and I, too, am pleased that the European Court of Auditors acknowledges the role played in bringing to an end the apartheid regime by those countries and organisations that were able to put aid into South Africa. I remind the Minister that, despite his disparaging remarks and the aspersions that he sought to cast on Opposition Members, that was done under a Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks were directed at particular Conservative Members, not Conservative Members in general, and certainly not at the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister said that because I felt that his remarks about Conservative Members went too far, especially because we have rightly tried to question the Minister on something that should be of great concern to every member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if, in his closing remarks, the Minister would further outline what action he is prepared to contemplate and support and review his explanatory memorandum, because had our time to put questions continued a little longer, I would have also queried point 7 in the explanatory memorandum, which says that the report has no financial implications. As I understand it, the Minister is coming round to our way of thinking: that the report may have implications and that action may have to be taken, not least on maladministration, which itself would carry financial implications. I hope that I am giving the Minister a chance to correct the explanatory memorandum and perhaps expand on it. I am generous in this matter because it is of great concern to me. I hope that the Minister will pursue it, otherwise all his protestations today will merely be hot air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with that point. My understanding of what is meant by financial implications—a standard heading in explanatory memorandums—is whether there are financial implications for the United Kingdom Government. In other words, do we have to spend more as a result of the reports? The answer is that there are no financial implications. Whether there are financial implications for the Commission or in relation to what the hon. Lady suggests is a different matter. She may have misunderstood the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation, but I do not think that I have misunderstood the point. I believe that the Minister's firm support for the changes in procedure and management of the budgets could have financial implications if it is necessary to put the right structures in place to ensure that the problem does not arise again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's opening remarks, he said that 30 per cent. of his Department's budget is involved. That is a large sum. I am surprised that his remarks have been so general. I would have hoped that he would have come to the Committee with some hard recommendations on how he is going to affect the decision making processes in the European Union so that the same circumstances do not arise again. After all, we are talking about a small part of something that is turning into a tremendous scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A newspaper today has the headline "EU Cash Scandal". The article allows us to see the missing billions across the European Union. The understatement of commitments is running at £3.4 billion; the understatement of payments in advance is running at £2.9 billion; the debts of member states are running at £1.3 billion; overpayments to Italian farmers are running at £525 million; money wasted in reducing fishing fleets stands at £209 million; and the New Zealand butter fiddle stands at £204 million. There is also an allegation of fraud in the Mediterranean development programme of £37 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, we are on to development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot dismiss in a cavalier fashion this catalogue of bungling. 
	<i>The Guardian,</i> which I am sure the Minister reads, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Bungling and theft waste billions"</p></blockquote>
in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will pay particular attention to the spend from his Department. The Committee knows that we are talking not about money that will go to rich people or to fat cats but about money that will go to projects and individuals and which, in many instances, means life or death, survival or oblivion. I hope that he will take the matter as seriously as I do. Although I may not be present to hear his closing remarks—I gave him advance notice of that—I shall read them carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the long catalogue of mismanagement is deeply alarming. Page 10 of the Court of Auditors report reveals:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Court reviewed the Commission's administration of the programmeand identified, after taking into account the management and control constraints under which the Commission and its partners were working, a number of weaknesses".</p></blockquote>
That is an understatement. The report goes on to specify:
	<br><blockquote><p>"incomplete files; lack of progress reports; the weak role of the European NGOs in project implementation, and poor financial management (over-funding of projects, large outstanding balances and non-recovery of unused amounts)."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will at least consider the UK's view on the non-recovery of unused amounts. If money can be recovered and delivered effectively as aid to the people who most need it, I am sure that the whole House would support doing so.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The Minister said that over the 18 months since he took office he has been deeply concerned about fraud and the delivery and efficacy of aid. He said that those matters had been at the forefront of his and the Secretary of State's agenda, and he left us with the impression that nothing has been more pressing in the day-to-day evaluation and administration of his Department's affairs. However, I examined the departmental report, produced in April 1998, and found no mention of the attacks on fraud or on maladministration that the Minister discussed. The UK recently held the European Union presidency under this Labour Administration, and I should have expected considerably more progress to have been made, especially as the Minister said that his Department had been at the forefront of those who are pressing for improvements in the administrative system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way—I may be about to make a similar point to hers. The order makes it clear that on this issue the Government support the Court of Auditors' recommendations. The hon. Lady said we have heard no recommendations from the Minister, but will she say which of the Court of Auditors' recommendations she thinks do not go far enough to combat the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the Minister explained how he would tackle the problem of incomplete files, which I mentioned and to which the report refers. The details that he gave today are less than satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and hon. Friends—who were, in many ways, abused by the Minister—were not considering the total withdrawal of aid; they wanted to know whether the Minister had considered the withdrawal of aid and whether he would hold up the distribution of any funds. Are funds still being distributed on the same basis as before, under the same structures and in the same poor way as is described in the Court of Auditors' report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister stopped such funding and requested his friends in the European Commission to halt payments until the administrative problems have been sorted out? If not, we shall waste millions of pounds while we wait for the report, for the 15 member countries to get together and for the South African authorities to discuss the matter with the EU. I did not hear the Minister give any guarantees of safeguards, but I hope that he will give the Committee suitable reassurances. I do not think that there is apolitical difference between the Opposition and the Government on this matter. I hope that no more money will be poured down an open drain and fail to reach those who most need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, the hon. Lady's speech has been appropriate for an address to a convention of auditors. Is she going to discuss the aid programme's objectives and what she thinks its priorities should be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to be too clever. I am addressing not a court of auditors but a report by the Court of Auditors. As any Committee member who
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
has had a proper job before he came into Parliament will know, managing a budget, knowing where the money goes and how it is spent and getting reports back are important. I know that the Minister had a proper job before he came into Parliament, and my remark was not intended as a backhanded insult to him. I cannot believe that any Committee member would not want every penny that we put into aid to reach the people who need it most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the simple point to ask how much of the £562 million has ended up in good aid projects on the ground? None of the papers seem to record that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point that adds to my argument. If the problem continues, we shall be back here next year to consider another Court of Auditors report on money that is being spent now and is administered under the same system. Leaving aside the question of whether the United Kingdom's presidency—a powerful position in the European Union—was successful, what did the Minister do during that presidency? He has alluded to it, but as far as anyone in this Room is concerned, money is still being spent inappropriately and possibly fraudulently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to many people about aid to Africa. There are no easy answers, but it is a question not only of European Union aid but of aid provided in many other ways. Someone from Africa who wants to remain nameless told me the other day that he has aid coming out of his ears, coming from the European Union, coming bilaterally from individual countries, coming from the World bank and from non-governmental organisations, and that it is not co-ordinated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in debating this Court of Auditors report today without putting the spend from the European Union in the context of other spend in South Africa. If the Minister can take one thing from this Committee, it is that there is no use in considering a European Union report alone. He must consider his own and other countries' bilateral aid programmes along with help from the World bank, other institutions and non-governmental organisations, and he must devise a method of co-ordinating aid so that in future millions—possibly billions—of pounds do not end up in the wrong people's pockets or just sit around doing nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Hon. Lady; such matters must be considered as a whole. However, the general thrust of her attack seems to be that she has interpreted the report's main criticism of the disbursement of the funds as a criticism that the money has gone to the wrong people. My interpretation of the main criticism is that the money has not gone to anyone, and that £350 million of the £800-odd million available has not been spent, which is very different from its having gone to the wrong people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but I am afraid that the report encompasses the whole range. It stops short of the broad point, but there is no doubt that it covers the full gamut of maladministration. I am not trying to score political points; I am deeply worried about such a report on such a sensitive issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady now accept that no money has been fraudulently spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not have the competence or the knowledge to say that; how could I possibly do so? I do not believe that even the Minister can say that over 10 years not one penny has been spent fraudulently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said, the Court of Auditors report does not include that, despite many criticisms about maladministration and inefficiency. I guarantee that we shall investigate any examples of fraud to which the hon. Lady wants to draw our attention, but so far neither she nor the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) have provided any such examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that generous offer, and hope that he will stick to it. However, he will find it rather difficult to examine the report; its assessment sheets are so poorly completed and contain such little detail that it is hard to establish what happened. Perhaps the Minister would be so good as to go through each individual report and drop me a line to tell me whether he considers that the analysis is comprehensive. I should be most interested in his assessment of the evaluations, which I consider to be weak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. Of course she cannot make definitive indictments relating to fraud—that is a matter for the authorities—but we can have our suspicions. As the president of the Court of Auditors said in Stern magazine,
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the fraud in the European Commission goes on as it is, then it could bring down the whole of the EU."</p></blockquote>
We made those remarks following a European Commission investigation into multi-million pound fraud in the aid budget for Rwanda and Burundi. Those are other parts of Africa, but one can draw the inference that if that happened in central Africa, we must look especially closely at the accounts for South Africa, where huge sums of money were involved that cannot be attributed to particular projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has taken further the point I was making before I sat down, and the point that I was going to make next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the slightest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I hope that, in winding up the debate, the Minister will tell us what he proposes in more detail—a bit more action and fewer warm words. In particular, I want to know whether the Minister will support his new-found friends in Germany, the German Conservatives, particularly in the European Parliament, who want to sack the entire Commission on the back of the reports to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks and to which I referred in mine. I would give way to the Minister for him to say whether he will support the German MEPs, but he does not rise to his feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Lady find it surprising that the political tactic being pursued by Conservative Members of the European Parliament was never pursued when Conservative Governments held the majority in the European Union in the years in which the fraud was taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, I was not in this place during that time, but as I said in my opening remarks, we should never forget that we would not have had a European Court of Auditors at all had it not been for the support of and pressing—the Minister's favourite word—by the Conservatives, in both the European Parliament and this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is a sad indictment of waste and mismanagement. I hope that the Minister will improve on his performance today by producing more details of what he intends to do. I look forward to reading the two reports that he has promised us, although it is always tomorrow, tomorrow. For the people to whom aid matters the most, there is sometimes no tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say how much I welcome the discussion because if our scrutiny can assist the Government and the European Union in ensuring that South Africa benefits more, our morning will not have been wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a lifelong opponent of the apartheid regime, like many Labour Members, I speak with feeling about South Africa. From the first day of the boycott of South African goods, I did not touch a single South African grape or glass of wine until the inauguration of President Mandela when, for the first time, I drank a full bottle of South African wine, which I enjoyed and used to toast President Mandela.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not refer to Conservative Members sitting on this Committee, but there was a range of opinion on apartheid in the Conservative party, and I had the interesting experience of opposing a representative of one of its extremes—my predecessor, Mr. John Carlisle. When I stood against him in 1983, I dubbed him the Member for Johannesburg, West instead of Luton, West, as the seat was at the time. That phrase acquired a national currency and has been quoted back to me on many occasions. Mr. Carlisle was a good Member of Parliament in many respects, but on that issue we had profound differences of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aid is always a difficult issue, and we should have no illusions about the current position in the world. If aid is the effective transfer of wealth and income to poorer nations and poorer people it should be supported, but the current debt repayment situation means that more money is coming back to the rich countries than is going out to the poor countries. That balance should be taken into account, and I hope that the Minister will consider that with regard to the European Union and Britain so that we do what we can to ensure a net transfer of income and wealth to poorer countries and poorer people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report, which is a matter for concern, relates to the past. We hope that the future will be much better, and I know that Ministers will do their best to ensure that it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his remarks for the record? Would he accept that all the projects under way—worth some 200 million ecu—are about the future rather than the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Where there has been underspending, I hope that money will get to the appropriate destination as soon as possible and that delays do not occur in the future. We should ensure not only that the right amounts of money are paid at the right time but that they get to the people who most need them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolving decision making and decentralising is clearly a good idea. The Commission's resources are not such that it can exercise detailed scrutiny and control in relation to the disbursements, but the European Union and member states must ensure that the organisations to which such decisions are to be devolved—Governments, Government agencies or whatever—spend the money correctly. To avoid repetition of problems, careful scrutiny must be maintained to ensure effective spending of aid money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to exchange losses, it is significant that most of the problems were caused by one private South African bank. If we are to devolve spending to private banks in countries that are even less regulated than our own, there will be problems. Bankers, and private bankers in particular, are not concerned about people's welfare; their job is to make profit for their shareholders. If they can use legal means to increase the exchange rate, buy and sell at the right time or increase their commission from exchange transactions to make a bit more money, they will do so because it is legitimate in their terms. Money should not be handed out to such agencies and organisations so that they can siphon off profits for themselves. I hope that the Government and the EU will ensure that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Greater openness and transparency, and some accountability, are necessary at every level. Public moneys in this country are carefully scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee in this House, and local authorities have to declare accounts. Even though we are relatively well regulated, we still have problems, so in poorer countries, which may be less well organised, there is even more reason to ensure accountability and transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the British Government's better bilateral aid practices could be translated to the European Union. I trust that our bilateral aid is better regulated than European Union aid, so we may have something to offer the European Union in helping it to account better and in ensuring how its moneys are spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to "vast sums of money". The sums going to South Africa are not vast; I welcome what has been spent and would like more to be spent. Over the period in question, it works out at about £50 million a year, which is not a lot of money. Perhaps people who are less numerate confuse billions and millions, but a sum of £50 million from the entire European Union is not a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can look forward to more generous disbursements in future, as well as ensuring that we do not recoup—or more than recoup—the money in other
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
ways. I notice that many of the projects involve European companies. Obviously we want European companies to operate in South Africa and elsewhere, but we do not want money to go from one European pocket to another, without much benefit to people in the countries involved. I hope that it is not a question of giving aid merely to secure trade or a project for a European company, the profit from which ultimately goes into our PEPs and TESSAs: that would be inappropriate. We want to ensure a genuine net transfer of wealth and income from the European Union to those countries genuinely to benefit the people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxieties have been expressed about the legitimacy, efficiency and honesty of such expenditure. Accountability is not only about being mean and accounting for public money, but is about ensuring that aid is not damned by accusations of corruption. Opponents of aid to poorer countries constantly argue that it goes to the corrupt—to private banks or drug smugglers, for example. If money is not targeted and effectively spent, those who are against the idea of helping poorer countries, who perhaps believe in a more brutal free market than already exists, might be able to use that fact to secure further public opposition to aid. It is already sufficiently difficult to sustain public support for aid to poorer countries. If we can demonstrate that people genuinely benefit from that aid and that the poor are genuinely better off, public support for aid will be maintained and strengthened. I hope that those points are helpful; I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. I agree with much of what has been said by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee; some good points have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the Court of Auditors report home two or three nights ago, poured a glass of wine, and thought that sleep would quickly follow, but became increasingly enraged. I had never read anything quite like it. I must express my shock and horror, as a great pro-European, with all the ideals of Europe and with fire in my belly. I read this stuff and was appalled. I did not fall asleep; I drank another glass of wine and became more enraged, and wrote notes about it. I defend the Secretary of State for International Development. Many months ago, when the Select Committee investigated the Lome agreement, several Committee members forcefully made that point, as the Secretary of State was well aware. At the time, I felt frustrated and annoyed that European aid is delivered so inefficiently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not offer to read the other 19; I shall take the hon. Gentleman's word for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was made then that it is easy to say that we should not provide any more money for European aid because it is much better to deliver it ourselves. However, if we can get it right—as we must—working within the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
EU will have a much greater effect on development. Countries will work together to give much bigger sums to much bigger projects all over the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. She raises an interesting question about the level at which aid is given. Does she accept that, if her argument were right, it would apply with greater strength to the World bank and other genuinely multilateral agencies, and would in fact be an argument for the upwards transference of aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There are different levels of aid that provide for a variety of projects. At a certain level, EU aid can achieve things that our own bilateral aid perhaps cannot. The same applies to the World bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an ex-doctor in the health service, I was particularly infuriated by p.28 of the report, which refers to one example of the setting up of an HIV-AIDS programme, in 1994. By 1996, when the auditors examined the programme, nothing had happened. The project failed due to the lack of proper capacity and Government support in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have seen at first hand the extent of the AIDS epidemic in Africa were horrified. Tens of thousands—probably hundreds of thousands—of people have died as a consequence. Two years were lost in the campaign against the disease. That delay is a bitter indictment against an aid programme that could have saved many lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked hard at the answers given by the Commission to the Court of Auditors' report. It is obvious that there is a shortage of staff; we must accept that. However, I challenge any political party in this country to tell the public that we need more bureaucrats in Europe. Given the hostility to Europe that the official Opposition whip up, that is not an option. We must look at other ways of tackling the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem lies in the organisation of the various aid departments in the Commission, which is quite extraordinary. I thought that NATO won the prize for the most acronyms, but the EU and its aid department probably runs it pretty close. There is a multiplicity of departments, divided by geographical area, by what they deliver, and so on. Reference is made to so-called channels in South Africa, which I do not quite understand. The organisation is overly complicated and overly competitive. The muddle and confusion is scandalous. Other member states must help us to ensure that the Commission streamlines the delivery of aid.

Every time we discuss Europe, particularly aid from Europe to the poorest peoples in the world, certain Opposition Members crowd around like a pack of hyenas picking at carrion. That is not helpful. They try to make political sport out of something that they believe to be wrong. They may believe that, but for 17 years their Government signed treaties, made agreements and oversaw arrangements. They may have set up the Court of Auditors, but they did precious little else if, after 17 years, the Court of Auditors is still reporting a shambles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another suggestion for the Minister. We cannot afford to wait another two years for a Court of Auditors report to say that perhaps there has been a tiny improvement but there is still a shambles. We must have regular reports, perhaps to the European Parliament. That is what it is there for. I shall not go into reform of European institutions, but European parliamentarians should oversee what goes on in the Commission and correct it if necessary. It is important to have regular reports so that we do not have to wait another two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know how the United States has behaved towards the United Nations concerning its contributions in the past couple of years.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government agree with the tenor of the hon. Lady's comments.

I draw the Minister's attention to trade issues. We seem to talk a lot about aid, but we separate it from trade. A lot of aid goes to South Africa, but various trade agreements, embargoes and disputes in Europe on matters such as wine exports from South Africa, potatoes and numerous other products, prevent South Africa from competing fairly and being able to receive proper income for its products. I urge him to communicate closely with ministers in other Departments. Aid involves not simply the Department for International Development; it depends on what the Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence are up to. Every Department must have the same policy on aid and support the ideals of the White Paper that was published last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mocked me in the House last year for implying that some Departments did not agree with everything in the development White Paper. She referred to the nature of a White Paper and said that of course other Departments agreed with it. During the past year, a number of matters have made us a little unhappy and I suggest that the Minister sends a copy of the White Paper with his Christmas cards and ensures that his hon. Friends read it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the debate and the Government's position. We should be able to make legitimate criticisms of the aid programme's administration within the overall context of supporting co-operation on aid throughout the European Union. I totally agree with my hon. Friend the Minister, who said that that criticism is more effective when it comes from people who support the principle of co-operation throughout the EU than when it comes from people who do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also strongly support the aid programme itself. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) referred to the Court of Auditors' key conclusion that the European Community's support to South Africa made a significant contribution to the fight against apartheid and to the commencement of the democratic transition. That is a crucially important point, which explains why Labour Members and some Opposition Members support the programme. It may be what divides Labour Members from some Opposition Members. I do not impugn the integrity of any one Opposition Member, and I respect the position adopted by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, who leads for the Opposition. However, I noted with interest that when my hon. Friend the Minister referred to the comments of Baroness Thatcher, the former Prime Minister, who has a history of branding Nelson Mandela as a terrorist, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), who has left the Committee Room, was nodding vigorously. That goes to show that attitudes among some Opposition Members never change on such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the need for effectiveness in the aid programme, the report covers the 10-year period 1986–96, and it is legitimate to ask how the previous Government proposed to scrutinise the aid programme. Did they come up with alternative scrutiny procedures to tackle the issues that have been identified. It is easy to lay the blame at the door of the present Government, but what did the previous Government, who are now in opposition, do during those 10 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the problem has been identified, it is absolutely right that we should deal with the question of maladministration. However, we need to have a sense of perspective—£562 million over a 10-year period is involved and £50 million a year is a sum that, frankly, Governments of all political persuasions occasionally use to make political gestures. I am not sure that the programmes that we have regularly supported in this country for 20, 30 or 40 years would stand up to the kind of scrutiny that we are applying to the EU aid programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make it clear, as my hon. Friend the Minister did, that there is no evidence to show that fraud has been committed for personal gain. When the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Member for Chesham and Amersham was challenged on that matter, she could provide no examples. There is no evidence of fraud being committed for personal gain. The problem in debates such as this is that, whenever we receive a report from the Court of Auditors, questions of maladministration and misappropriation automatically lead to assertions that fraud has been committed for personal gain, but that blunts the effectiveness of our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also recognise the fact that the relevant documents show that there have been significant improvements in some areas over the past two years. In 1996, only 22 per cent. of the available payment appropriations were paid out, but by 1997 the relevant figure had risen to 47 per cent. and so far this year the figure is up to 69 per cent. Progress is being made and we should recognise it when it occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report raises concerns on which we should focus. Our earlier debate made it clear that the procedures that the European Union uses to implement its aid programme are overly complicated and bureaucratic. We do not hear that story just from the recipients of aid programmes in South Africa. People in receipt of structural funds in this country will say the same thing. We need to make progress on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We clearly need—as the Court of Auditors details—to delegate more authority through the EU to local officers of the Commission. Given that every contract for aid is signed off and authorised by Brussels, it is hardly surprising that such problems arise. Frankly, that type of centralised control was used in the Roman empire. The difference is that in those days fear of death was used as a management tool to ensure that misappropriation did not occur. For some strange reason, it is not considered appropriate in this day and age to ensure the efficient use of EU funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also clearly need to have skilled personnel on the ground to undertake that delegated authority. The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) was absolutely right when she said that it is not very popular to call for an increase in bureaucrats and personnel within the European Union. Once again, we need to get the issues into perspective. The number of so-called bureaucrats working within the European Union is less than the number of people employed by the national health service, which provides a context to the discussions. If we want effective programmes that are administered properly, we have to provide the personnel to undertake them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much welcome my hon. Friend the Minister's reference to the discussions about the creation of a fraud unit. If there is misappropriation and fraud, it can be stopped only by the threat of penal action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to co-ordinate accounting practices between member states. Project administrators in South Africa have been forced to use two or three different systems to account for the money that they are spending. It is hardly surprising that problems have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also undoubtedly need a greater focus on and assessment of the impact and results of the aid money that is being spent. There is a cultural problem within the EU. All too often, success is measured in terms of the amount of money that is being spent rather than the results
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
achieved by the use of that money. However, that problem too is not unique to the EU. It exists throughout the political process in member states. We need to explore ways of ensuring that recipient countries accept ownership of and responsibility for the programmes—and policing them. That would allow them to support the work of EU officials on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need change, but in arguing for that change and in criticising the way in which the aid budget is being dispersed, we need to make it clear—and I am pleased that the Minister has done so—that we support the aid programme and that it is part of our overall aim to increase the amount of aid. We must also make it clear that we support the historical basis of the programme, which was set up to support non-governmental organisations in the fight against apartheid, a policy with which the Labour party is proud to be associated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU has a role to play. It is worth noting that in the past five years the EU aid budget has increased in contrast with the aid budget of the top 22 countries listed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has fallen by about 5 per cent. Although we need to get the mechanisms and delivery right, the programmes and Europe's role through the EU are welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to earlier comments. Yes, there are problems and yes, criticisms need to be made, but please, every time such a problem is identified, must it be used as an opportunity to bash Europe and the EU. Constructive criticism, yes—let us give credit where it is due and advocate detailed changes where appropriate—but the report does not undermine or destroy the case for the EU in the way that some Opposition Members claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall restrict my remarks to what will happen in future, so I hope that Labour Members will dispense with efforts to castigate me for being anti-European. I shall speak up so that the Minister can hear me—I apologise if he was unable to hear me earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual report on the EPRD is tagged as document D in "EC Development Aid to South Africa (1995–1996)". The Minister referred to the commitments and payments for 1996 and 1997, which are listed in annexe IV. Those figures show that 28 million—under 25 per cent.—of a total of 129 million ecu were dispensed in 1996, and that 59 million—under 50 per cent.—of a total of 127 million were dispensed in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in 1998 onwards. If I were the Minister, before coming to Committee this morning I would have attended to the current state of affairs, as detailed in annexe VI, which deals with projects already under way with a total commitment of 207 million ecu. Pages 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 43 and 45 detail projects that are listed as under way and as having ended before the date of the report. That is odd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The projects are massively underspent. Page 25 outlines an important project on land affairs, which is a matter of great concern in South Africa. Incidentally, I wish to associate myself with remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. I did not visit
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
South Africa before the end of apartheid, but since then I have worked there extensively. Many of the projects are good in principle, but many of them are not being carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The land affairs project has commitments of 11 million ecu and disbursals of 1 million ecu. The end of the project is given as May 1998. That date has already passed and less than 10 per cent. of the commitments have been disbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not trouble the Committee with other discrepancies that I have noted: the pattern repeats itself in every case. None of the projects is fully spent; most of them are wildly underspent. Projects that have almost ended, and so are likely to be underspent, appear on pages 35, 39 and 40. Page 35, for example, summarises a big project on water affairs to which 18 million ecu has been committed. That project is critical: all over South Africa people are dying for want of good sanitation. The Minister knows that: he and his colleagues have spoken admirably about the need for water sanitation and drainage in South Africa and east Africa
The project ends in May 1999 and only 724,000 ecu has been disbursed. There are two possibilities. The project may be wholly misconstrued, and the contractors will be paid the remaining 17 million ecu in five months, never having received an interim payment. However, it is more likely that the project will be hugely underspent. That also applies to projects that appear on pages 39 and 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report describes a final category of projects that are unfinished; indeed, they have hardly even begun, despite having been inaugurated years ago. Details of those projects appear on pages 31, 32, 36, 38, 41, 44 and 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I drew the Minister's attention to page 38, which outlines the single most important project in the report—and, indeed, in South Africa today. Anyone familiar with South Africa knows that the apartheid regime created an appalling problem when Eskom and other utilities were used extensively for the exclusive benefit of the white population. Electrification was therefore not available to most of the black population. As a result, some black schools are unusable at certain times of the year; frankly, I would describe them as unusable at all times of the year. It is not feasible to extend the grid sufficiently for those rural black schools to be electrified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit that I had not realised that the EU had had the admirable idea that Eskom should produce and install solar panels there. That financing decision was made in 1996. The rules of the Government's reconstruction and development programme urged fast electrification of schools. I had a conversation with the relevant Minister on that subject about two years ago, and now here we are with commitments of 15 million ecu and expenditure is nil. Two years later, there has been absolutely no progress on a vital programme. Every single case on the pages that I have mentioned is covered by the same rubric. In total, commitments of 207 million ecu and expenditure of 14 million ecu are presented in annex VI; the Minister should have known that before he arrived here. The amounts are all attributable to projects that have completed their contractual date, almost completed their contractual date, or have been running for years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
That is an extraordinary state of affairs. I do not blame the Minister personally; manifestly, he did not bring it about. No doubt some of my right hon. and hon. Friends should have attended ealrier to what happened before 1996. However, all the projects have been under way during the tenure of this Government, who—like their predecessors—have done absolutely nothing. If they had been doing anything, the Minister would have known. He would have known the figures. Had I been standing before the Committee, I would have started by examining those figures. They are the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that Conservative Ministers and their equivalents around Europe failed previously. However, this set of Ministers must attend to the projects that are currently under way and nothing is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame the Minister because it is difficult to get a grip on these things. Much that has been said by Government and Opposition members of the Committee is undoubtedly true; it is difficult to implement these projects correctly. I do not doubt the Minister's good will and I am sure that he will now go and thump the table. However, I wonder whether the product of his thumping will be very great and we must think hard about how we should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members will say that I exhibit deep Euro-sceptical tendencies when I point out that one possibility is to move the programmes back to levels at which—like our own programmes—they work rather well. The French programmes also generally work well; I cannot say the same of the Italian or German programmes. If that course of action is not chosen, there should be a radical overhaul of the implementation of the programmes; not only by secondment, as the Minister suggested, but by taking in hand the whole structuring of the programmes so that we do not face two-year delays when nothing is done. That means rounding up all the Brussels officials who are responsible for the programmes and re-sorting the whole caboodle. That is a major administrative task and it can be done only by the Council applying sufficient pressure on the Commission at Commissioner level to make the Commissioner do the dirty deeds that will be needed to put matters right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does that, even though I do not support his Government, I will buy him a good dinner, or give him a lollipop, or drink champagne to him. It would be a major advance for South Africa, the European Union and, of course, the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing intrinsic about the matter. It is simply a matter of practice.

It is not impossible to deliver aid effectively at a European level; it is possible to deliver it effectively and well, or ineffectively and badly, at any level. This country has one
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
of the best aid programmes in the world: not one of the biggest, but one of the best. Therefore, it is ironic that our Ministers should be partially presiding over one of the worst. Something must be done about that. It can be done, but it will not be done by nice soundbites, or by congratulating ourselves that only 50 per cent. was spent in one year or another. It will be done only by restructuring the whole of aid-giving so that it operates in a way that is more like that of the Overseas Development Administration or the Department for International Development. That is major administrative task for the Minister. I hope that he will consider closely what is to be done over the next two years and the things that I have been pointing to, and that he will take the task in hand. If he does, I shall congratulate him mightily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make some brief points, as I think we are missing the plot a little, something we tend to do when talking about everything that auditors produce. Auditors are vitally important in today's society but when they wander through a garden they count the flowers rather than looking at the colours and smelling the fragrance. To some extent that is what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The peaceful overthrow of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic regime in South Africa was probably one of the great humanitarian achievements of the 20th century. If, through its aid package, the European Union contributed in some small way to overthrowing that regime and to stabilising the democratic regime that followed, that is a part of the triumph that it can share and should be proud of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can argue that we should have done better and that things could have been done differently, but if we contributed to that triumph, let us praise the European Union for that achievement and not attack it out of hand. It is right to be concerned that 44 per cent. of this aid package has gone unspent. It is a tragedy that that has happened; poor people could have been helped more, but we should stop and consider the context in which these services had to be delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if we were looking at a Court of Auditors report on the UK spending of EU funds over the period 1986–96, it would not surprise me if we found that even more than 44 per cent. had gone unspent. It would not surprise me to find wholesale mismanagement of those funds or downright corruption in some parts of the process. The fact that there is a similar situation in South Africa, under far more difficult circumstances, is something that we should consider seriously. We are not looking at the issue in the right context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Figure 1 of the report, which is difficult to read, deals with the political situation as it developed through the first few years of the aid programme. The year 1985, just before the aid programme began is described as the "Apogee of apartheid". It states that the South African Government proclaimed the national state of emergency in July 1985. It lists how in 1988 there were:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Political difficulties for the beneficiaries; harassment, banning orders, imprisonment"—</p></blockquote>
and—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Bomb attacks on Channels and project beneficiaries offices."</p></blockquote>
We have enough difficulty in Thanet spending our European money and no one is blowing up our offices while we are tying to do it. Let us remember what the channels were going through when we were trying to distribute this aid to them. It was important that we delivered it in those first few years through organisations that would deliver it to the people and not to the state. The channels were a good attempt to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The channels can be criticised because they did not keep their files quite the way that we would have liked or because they did not evaluate all the projects afterwards with the thoroughness that we would have liked, but let us remember the situation that they were dealing with and the problems that they were trying to address. The fact that they got anywhere near to providing the same standards of efficiency as we do in the UK and the rest of the EU is something on which they should be congratulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept much of what the hon. Gentleman says, but does he accept that the situation has altered radically and that those comments cannot be applied to aid given today or, indeed, given a year ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do agree. However, we must remember that European Union aid packages—structural funds or aid packages to nations such as South Africa—are usually projected ahead; there is usually two or three years' worth of projects for which the money has not been spent but has been allocated. If we were to investigate the distribution of structural funds in any European Union member state and calculate the percentage yet to be committed or disbursed, I suspect that we would find that it would not be very different from some of the figures in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the circumstances at the time, it is not surprising that some of the initial projects were poorly formulated. It is sad that only four of the 700 projects have been properly evaluated, and that must be addressed. However, I have no experience of projects in the United Kingdom, or in other European Union member states, being properly evaluated. I was only partly joking when I said earlier, in response to the point made by the hon. Member for Richmond Park, that of the 20 reports that we have received this year, this is the least enraging. Other European Union reports have revealed some diabolical scandals in civilised, established, developed countries; this report is nothing in comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The projects certainly need more staff, better filing and thorough evaluation. Moreover, clear objectives and measurement against those objectives are vital. Nevertheless, we must remember that such aid made a significant contribution to a major achievement in South Africa. Given the circumstances of that achievement, the projects did not do too badly. We should not be too hard in evaluating them. We need to keep this Court of Auditors report in context and compare it much more carefully with others from the rest of the European Union, about which I am much more worried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of allowing the worthiness of the objectives of development programmes to obscure the real need for genuine criticism of the inefficacy of their implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a starting text, I shall take the Secretary of State's commitment to the House that during the United Kingdom's presidency of the European Union, development aid would be directed to the alleviation of poverty. I am not clear whether the methodology that we have embraced by using the European Union as a vehicle for the alleviation of poverty to the extent that we do secures that objective. It is sad, but true, that all the evidence in the papers and in this Court of Auditors report leads me to assume the contrary, and we must put that fact in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors recognises that no less than £3 billion of the European Union's overall budget cannot be accounted for. We must also recognise that we contribute a great deal to the European Union—£10,000 million a year—and yet, as I mentioned last week, we can find only £10 million for humanitarian assistance for hurricane-stricken countries of central America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that the political emotion involved in trying to develop South Africa will divert us from other countries with greater need and from the requirement to ensure that our aid is disbursed properly. I have heard very few criticisms of the Minister's Department over our bilateral development aid programme, but criticisms in this report are legion. I therefore ask that the Minister and Her Majesty's Government look at those matters objectively. I have no preconceptions against Europe—I voted for our entry in 1971 and waited until 6.45 am to make my speech in favour of it. It was only after Maastricht that I started to change my views. The hon. Member for Richmond Park has had her eyes opened by the report, as have we all. I hope that we draw the appropriate conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good and constructive debate. We are here in the first place because the Select Committee—rightly so—asked that we should consider the report. That Committee was chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) and contained a majority of Labour Members. It was therefore Labour Members who were expressing concern, to which we are responding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to underline to Opposition Members that the Government have agreed with the Court of Auditors report; we welcome it. Therefore, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham was entirely wrong to imply that the Government were complacent. We are not complacent; the reverse is true. We have intervened vigorously to ensure the discussion of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's discussion has produced general agreement that the effectiveness of the delivery of EC aid must be improved, and the Europhobes have ended up in a relatively small minority. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) said, we must also take account—especially during this first phase—of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
the extreme difficulties of delivering aid in South Africa. In retrospect, the programme appears very effective. As a number of my hon. Friends have said—it is quoted in the report—it was effective in speeding the end of the appalling apartheid system in South Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poverty eradication—I say this to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson)—is of course our principal objective. That is why we produced the White Paper entitled "Poverty Elimination", which was the first on the subject for 22 years—the previous Government did not do very much about it. We are making a major effort to turn around the European Commission programme in relation to poverty eradication. If we do not achieve that we must decide what other action we need to take. But we are determined to use every possible method to turn that programme around.

The hon. Member for West Dorset highlighted the issue of underspending, about which we are concerned. He gave some specific examples illustrating our general worries. In doing so he helped the Committee to understand better the general problem. However, EC projects often last up to 10 years, so the final dates are often unrealistic estimates. Projects typically take much longer than expected, and the dates are consequently extended. It may not be the best method but it should be taken into account when reading the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree that the Commission is too slow; we have said that. We have made specific proposals in the institutional strategy paper, which I hope will be published next month, for speeding it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate the effectiveness of this Committee and the willingness of the Government to consider points made, we will take up each of the specific points raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset with the Commission and give him its responses. If there are any other points, we will take them up. We will investigate every complaint and suggestion made, every point raised, in relation to inefficient spending, as the hon. Gentleman has illustrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of aid delivery, the EU is complicated. It has perhaps four or five different competences, including PHARE, TACIS and the European Commission Humanitarian Office, which have built up over time as the Community has developed. Indeed, the European Community itself has changed—we must now call it the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three directorates general that deal with development issues. That is not satisfactory. It results in confusion and lack of efficiency, which is why we are not complacent. Along with some other member countries, we have been leading the call for improvements in effectiveness and efficiency. As the hon. Member for Richmond Park rightly said, the process must be streamlined, the weaknesses tackled, the quality of EC aid improved. We share those concerns. That is why, through our institutional strategy paper, the institutional strategy programme will for the first time set the agenda for reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the institutional strategy paper, our 18 objectives will make it clear that the poverty focus must be improved, that the Commission's organizational
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
structure for managing external assistance must be rationalised, and that staffing must be strengthened. It may be unpopular to talk about increasing bureaucracy, but staffing must be strengthened to deliver aid more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aid management systems must also be improved. Procedures must be streamlined and, as has been suggested, collaboration and co-ordination between the Commission, its member states and other agencies such as the World bank must be strengthened. Officials and Ministers will pursue those 18 specific proposals through the Development Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we agree with the findings and criticisms of the Court of Auditors. Monitoring and evaluation has been insufficient, and must be improved. Disregard for the local environment must be taken into account, as must unwieldy management, inadequate project management systems, and poor co-ordination with other donors and NGOs. The problem of insufficient delegation must also be tackled. As I said earlier, we want greater authority to be delegated to people who know the situation on the ground, and who can work together with member countries, the World bank and other donors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, credit must be given where it is due. The Commission has started to take on board those points. The setting up of the Service Commun Relex, or SCR, is an important step forward. 
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> My hon. Friends seem to realise that my command of other languages is not brilliant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common delivery of Community assistance is very important, but there is a cautionary point to be made. If it is delivered badly, the amount of bureaucracy could increase. Power must be devolved to the SCR in such a way as to ensure that delivery is effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will make those points to the Development Committee on 30 November, and we hope for support from other countries. The renegotiation of Lome has provided a further opportunity to improve the effectiveness of the delivery of the Commission's programme. Every opportunity is being taken to raise those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Richmond Park also mentioned coherence among donors, which is important. When the European Union is the largest donor it might be appropriate for it to provide a lead in general coherence, collaboration and co-operation, but in other cases the World bank might be more appropriate. In matters concerning Latin America, the Inter-American Development bank might be appropriate and in some cases a specific country might be the most appropriate. For example, in South Africa, the United Kingdom is the co-ordinator of health care. There are horses for courses and account must be taken of local circumstances with greater co-ordination and collaboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Richmond Park referred to coherence and I agree with her that trade is vital—we seem to agree a lot at the moment, which is unrelated to any other factors of co-operation and collaboration. We are delighted that the discussions on the trade and

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
development agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa are back on the rails. We hope that a deal will be presented to the meeting of the general affairs Council of Ministers on 7 December. There have been problems, mainly with mediterranean countries, but we now want to push ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a significant change in the running of the Department in Whitehall. When it was part of the Overseas Development Administration and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, it was a delivery agency in which commercial and diplomatic considerations often ruled the roost. It is now a development body, and development considerations are to the fore. Consideration is given not just to delivery of aid but to the relevance of trade, investment, debt and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North—that wonderful change of representation was particularly welcomed in South Africa—said that the United Kingdom should lead the call for more generous treatment of debt. I know that he knows that our Chancellor and our Secretary of State for International Development have done that with the World bank and the International Monetary Fund, and I have done so with the regional development banks. We have taken the lead in speeding up the initiative on heavily indebted poor countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been doing a great job in central America, not just with immediate assistance, but with an initiative to set up a trust fund, which is now snowballing. I met the five central American ambassadors on Wednesday and they greatly welcome what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to other points that were raised, but if I do not do so adequately, I shall read the record and try to write to hon. Members on specific points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I assure all members of the Committee that we are determined to ensure that the Commission's programme is more effective. It has been effective in many ways in South Africa, but there is room for improvement. We want NGOs and other civil organisations to be used more and we want greater donor co-ordination. I referred to different people taking the lead so that it can be more effective, not only in South Africa, but elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want decentralisation. I was recently in Fiji, Gaza and central America—some people envy me the job that I have the privilege of doing. Wherever I go people tell me that the Commission should delegate responsibility so that it is unnecessary for every decision to be made in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, the Commission's programme should concentrate on poverty eradication. South Africa has nine million people living in abject poverty, and one in four people throughout the world lives in abject poverty. That is a blight on society and we must give greater dignity and more hope to poor people, which will also give us and the other countries of Europe greater dignity and pride.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i> Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 9690/98, the European Court of Auditors Special Report No. 7/98 on the European Development Aid Programme for South Africa (1986–96) and its recommendations to the Commission; and supports the Government's position that these recommendations are practical and sensible and that the Government will work with Member States and other partners in all European Community development assistance programmes, and particularly in detailed arrangements to succeed the present EPRD in South Africa, after 1999, to ensure that these recommendations are fully implemented.</p></blockquote></p>
