	<div class='legislation'>Draft Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Border Rivers) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order puts in place customised arrangements for the control and accountability of public authorities that have been specified as cross-border public authorities. Those are bodies, Government Departments, offices or office-holders that have mixed functions in that some of their functions relate to devolved matters in Scotland and some do not. Examples include the forestry commissioners, who deal with devolved matters in Scotland, but who also operate in England and Wales. Another example is the Scottish committee of the Council on Tribunals which, although it operates only in Scotland, deals with both reserved and devolved matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That last example helps to make an important point. The border to which we refer when talking about cross-border public authorities need not be the geographical border between Scotland and England. Rather, those bodies are partly within devolved Scotland and partly not. Perhaps it would have been better to say that they were cross-Parliament bodies. They do not necessarily operate across the border, but some of their functions relate to reserved matters and some to devolved matters. As a result, certain provisions of the Scotland Act 1998—particularly those for the transfer of ministerial functions—need to be clarified when applied to such bodies. As I will explain, designation of a body as a cross-border public authority is designed to deal with those potential problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Specification) Order 1999, which was made in May, specified 65 authorities as cross-border public authorities. Specification as a cross-border public authority applies what might be called the "default" provisions in section 88 of the Scotland Act. That means that the ordinary transfer of ministerial functions under the Scotland Act is disapplied in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
respect of such bodies. Ministers will, therefore, not automatically acquire such devolved functions in connection with those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Scotland Act also provides a wide-ranging power to make provision by Order in Council in relation to cross-border public authorities. In particular, an order can adjust default provisions, and the draft order uses that power to make such an adjustment to supplement or replace the default provisions—not for all 65 of the cross-border public authorities, but for 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision that is made for each authority is tailored to that authority. It is, therefore, not possible to describe the arrangements wholly in general terms. However, the general theme of the order is to give Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament greater control that is afforded by the default arrangements over the 30-odd cross-border public authorities. It will do that by, for example, providing for certain functions to be exercised by Ministers of the Scottish Parliament, rather than by a Minister at Westminster. For the assistance of hon. Members, we have prepared a guide to the order setting out the background to each of the bodies dealt with by the order and explaining the overall effect of the Scotland Act 1998 and the order on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to use the example of the forestry commissioners. Forestry is a devolved matter, so decisions on forestry in Scotland will be taken by the Scottish Parliament and its Ministers. However, in devolving forestry the Government felt that it would be a mistake to abandon structures that have served the forestry sector well over many years. Allowing the Forestry Commission to continue to update on a Great Britain-wide basis will ensure that Scotland, England and Wales can continue to take advantage of access to shared knowledge and expertise and greater efficiency in the use of resources. For that reason, the Forestry Commission has been specified as a cross-border public authority. Devolving policy responsibility means that the powers of Ministers here with regard to forestry in Scotland will transfer to the Scottish Ministers. Likewise, responsibility for financing the commission's activities in Scotland will also be transferred to Scottish Ministers. However, the Forestry Commission itself will continue to operate on a Great Britain basis, with all the sensible advantages that that allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary intention of the order is to transfer the power of direction over the operation by the Forestry Commission—I shall continue to use the same example—of its functions as regards Scotland from the Secretary of State for Scotland to Scottish Parliament Ministers. The Scottish Parliament will also be responsible for funding forestry in Scotland. The order provides for the Scottish activities of the commission to be funded out of the Scottish consolidated fund and, similarly, for proceeds from the commission's activities in Scotland to be paid into that fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The order, therefore, makes sensible provision to ensure that cross-border public authorities can continue to operate after 1 July with appropriate input and control by the Scottish Parliament and its Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Border Rivers) Order 1999. As the Committee knows, the border between Scotland and England crosses the Tweed and Esk rivers. Section 111 of the Scotland Act 1998 therefore provides the scope for whole river management of the two rivers by this Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, acting by means of Orders in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order does several things. First, it allows for a continuation of the status quo in management terms, so that throughout its length the Tweed will continue to be regarded as essentially a Scottish river managed by the River Tweed council; for its part, the Esk will continue to be regarded throughout its length as an English river and, as such, regulated by the Environment Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the order clarifies the powers of the Environment Agency in relation to the Esk, places an obligation on that agency to provide an annual report of its activities to the Scottish Parliament, and enhances enforcement powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the order seeks to address the age-old problem of fishery rights in the Solway where the Esk tends to meander, sometimes to the north of the border that runs down the middle, and sometimes to the south of it. In brief, the order allows Scots netsmen to fish out to the middle of the Esk from the north side and English netsmen to fish to the middle of the river from the south side, regardless of the position of the river at the time—I apologise to Committee members for not assisting them with diagrams and other visual aids. The proviso, of course, is that the netsmen must be properly licensed or authorised to do that. None of that affects the exclusive right of the people of Annan—bestowed on them by royal charter in the 16th century—to fish within what is known as the Annan box. Thus, the order establishes the principle of whole river management for the two border rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In closing, I might add that the order received cross-party approval in the Scottish Parliament when it was debated there on 3 June. Both orders were approved by that Parliament. Only the Tweed and Esk fisheries order provoked a vote which, the Committee will be interested to learn, was carried by 120 to 3. I think that the three were Dennis Canavan and two Scottish Nationalists who pushed the wrong buttons.

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I approach the orders with a sense of incipient nostalgia, because they are the last in the heroically long sequence of measures that have been necessary to implement this grisly episode. They appear to be pellucid—in other words, I was actually able to understand them. That distinguishes them from other aspects of the matter that we have had to discuss in recent months. I think that it was at the tail end of the debates on the Scotland
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Act that my erstwhile leader, my hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), described the whole issue as being as clear as mud. The orders have clarified the mud and, so far as the rivers are concerned, put it in a kind of glorified suspension. In respect of the cross-border public bodies, I cannot see how the matter could have been better sorted out. Although we had some worries about the forestry commissioners, the order appears to represent the best that can be made of the job, and we wish it well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot leave our discussions without recording that I failed this morning to mention what I promised myself that I would always mention on every occasion when the Henry VIII provision arises, in however harmless a context—that is, that I object profoundly to the idea. However, I admit that if there must be such measures, in this case they could not have been better executed. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on a job well done, and hope that we shall never again see such things. If we have to debate them in due course in relation to the English regions, I for one shall shed many bitter tears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As hon. Members might expect, I am concerned mainly with the order's effect on the River Tweed. Liberal Democrat Members are perfectly happy with the order relating to cross-border bodies. As the Minister said, that is a rather odd description, because the border that is crossed is not so much a national border as a jurisdictional boundary between reserved and non-reserved matters. However, although the nomenclature is somewhat misleading, we entirely agree with the order's purposes and the way in which they have been executed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the River Tweed—as I am bound to do, because my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) and I represent all of it other than the part that is represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). It is a Liberal Democrat river from end to end. It also contains salmon, which can be a very emotive subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are satisfied with the way in which the order has been drafted. However, several issues can arise from consultation about complicated cross-border matters such as this, and some of those are fresh in my mind. Not so long ago, in a nearby Committee room, we discussed the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundary Order 1999, which dealt with the boundary out to sea. During that debate, my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) and I raised a number of concerns, which we felt that the Minister addressed satisfactorily. However, it was not made clear that substantial numbers of affected people—namely, Scottish fishermen—had apparently not been consulted as we believed that they should have been. Consequently, it has become an explosive issue in the Scottish Parliament. What was done according to perfectly defensible principles—that is, determination according to normal national boundaries—had not been discussed with some of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
those most affected, and alternative practical methods of handling some of the potential issues involved had not been properly explored. I am anxious that that situation should not arise under the order. I do not think that it will, because the order replicates current practice. The Tweed is best managed as a single river, as is the Esk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as English interests are concerned, the implementation of the order depends on consultation with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the United Kingdom Government. He will be acting as a UK Minister on behalf of English citizens, including my English constituents. It is important that we have a clear understanding that the Minister will always consult with affected interests when he is consulted by the Scottish Executive about the measures referred to in the order. I hope that he can say that that will be the Government's practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about precarious livelihoods and about those whose livelihoods are at stake because they are involved either in licensed net fishery or in the many other aspects of the border's economy dependent on salmon fishing, including that by rod and line. Such livelihoods can often be drastically affected by factors such as changes in the dates of permitted fishing seasons. Part III of the order refers to such matters. Where changes in law or regulation can take place that directly affects citizens and activities in England located close to the border, there must be a proper means of representation and consultation for those on the English side. I wish to be satisfied that that will be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am content that the shape of the order is expressly designed to continue the practice that has gone on satisfactorily for many years. The management of the river is by a Scottish based body—the River Tweed council—on which there is English representation. The future protection of salmon stocks in the river requires delicate management and is dependent on factors that happen far from the Tweed, such as what happens to the salmon in the high seas hundreds of miles away, and many other things that are still not properly understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have illustrated the need for a good management body. The present arrangement seems a reasonable basis for that, but there must always be consultation; I hope that I can be assured that there will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was prompted to intervene by the intervention of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). He and I will remember how difficult these matters can be—he raised the question of the coble fishermen on the Tweed in a Committee considering the Fisheries Act 1981. That subject is genuinely of considerable importance, and I know how concerned he was at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to ask a question because constituents have not accused me of negligence, but have asked what on earth I was doing regarding the order to which
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed referred when talking about the designation of boundaries. Frankly, I have said nothing. I happened to deplore the fact that the subject was raised because, bluntly, I think it a nonsense that there should be such difficulties between Scotland and England when, for 300 years, there have been none. But so be it—we have had the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding was that the Scottish Office was presenting us with a decision that was in keeping with the law. I would like to ask the Minister about the subject, since it has been raised. Were the Government following the legal imprimatur in relation to the fishing boundaries? Were we not alert and should have raised the subject? Since it has now been raised, I would like some reflection from the Government that I could send to my constituents who seem, on the surface, justifiably annoyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having arrived late to the Committee. I will be brief, but I wish to raise a point with the Minister. I heard some of the contribution of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, including the mention that fishings can be a controversial issue in and around the border areas. My concern is obviously for the Solway estuary and the River Esk. I have mentioned previously the issue of haaf net fishings in the Solway estuary and the problems arising from the shifting channels. I shall not talk about conflicts, but there are, on occasion, discussions, debates and arguments about whether fishermen from my constituency are fishing in what are perceived as English waters and vice versa. Shifting channels sometimes lead to English fishermen fishing on the Scottish side and to Scottish fishermen fishing on the English side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification from the Minister about the order. It should not in any way disadvantage those involved in haaf net fishing. One miserable evening only a couple of weeks ago, a young man who was just over 30 was out on the Solway estuary when he was swept away for three hours. In all reality, he was lucky to survive; he was swept down towards the village of Gretna. He counts himself lucky, but when he recovers his gear he will be out again fishing in the Solway estuary. The issue is about that young man and many others who have been involved in haaf net fishing for many years. Can we be assured that the order will not penalise such people and their fishing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed referred to consultation. I completely agree with him about the way in which things should happen. The order sets out that Scottish Ministers must consult UK Ministers. It is important for UK Ministers to consult English interests and all those on the English side who are affected before framing their reply to Scottish Ministers. That is the way in which such things should be done and in which the Government would undertake to fulfil the obligations in regard to consultation.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked about fishery boundaries. I think that he was referring to a previous order that went through the House, rather than to the present order. I give my hon. Friend the assurance that the boundary lines were established in line with common practice in international law. Legal advice was taken, and the coordinates that define the boundaries were calculated in accordance with well-established common practice in international law. My hon. Friend said that he regretted the need to define such a boundary, but it was obviously necessary as a result of the Scotland Act. The Act sets out that the new Scottish Parliament would henceforth legislate for certain British waters, so we had to define exactly what that area of waters would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend answer one question? Do the Scottish fishermen's organisations have any justification for gurning that they were not consulted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to my hon. Friend is that a press release was issued when the order was published, well before it came to be debated in this House; the order was not just laid in an obscure room in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important point relates to the definition of the boundary—my hon. Friend wanted to know whether we had followed accepted legal advice. I can tell him that it is in line with accepted procedures within international law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat my point: the recent Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 did not set a very good example for dealing with this order. This order will affect very small-scale fishermen—haaf net fishermen on the Solway and net and coble fishermen on the Tweed. They are not part of the big organisations that keep a close watch on what statutory instruments are going through Parliament, so consultation on the order will have to be much better than on the previous order. In the latter case, my feeling is that more deliberate consultations should have taken place, rather than the Government relying on publication. In this instance, the appearing of something in 
	<i>The London Gazette</i> or a press release
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that does not get taken up by the press will not count as sufficient consultation as defined by paragraph 3 of this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes his point, but a press release was issued at the time of publication and was reported in the press. However, I accept the need always to try to maximise consultation. Certainly I am assured that there was extensive consultation when we drafted the Tweed and Esk order. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that that should be the norm in future practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have found those at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to be most courteous and efficient. But are we to believe that it did not occur to anyone to alert the fishermen to what was up? That seems a considerable lacuna, which somehow justifies the gurning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a point but, having issued a press release about the matter, we brought the matter into the public domain, which provided an opportunity for those who were interested to make a contribution. The substantive point of argument which my hon. Friend raised earlier is important—whether it followed the burden of accepted international legal advice and practice. I am assured that it did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown), the order should solve the problem of the uncertain boundary of the meandering river by providing that shifting channels do not affect fishing rights. It fixes the boundary on the middle line of the main channel, or, to use the legal expression, ad medium filum aquae. I hope that that will be of some satisfaction to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
