	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 7, in page 2, line 44, leave out subsection (6) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) No order made under this section shall be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 43, in page 2, line 45, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) The Secretary of State shall establish within one year of the passing of this Act a films tribunal to which any British film maker may appeal against an unfair price paid by an independent television contractor or the BBC for a feature film intended for exhibition on television.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>(8) If, in the opinion of the tribunal, a below market or unfair price has been offered by the television operator the tribunal shall have the power to order that a proper price be paid, or any contract be nullified.</p>

	<p>(9) The tribunal shall have the power to listen to a complaint from any British film maker whose product has been exhibited in a British cinema within the previous five years, regardless of whether he has been the maker of the feature film about which the complaint has been made."</p>

	<p>No. 44, in page 2, line 45, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) The Secretary of State shall, by order made by statutory instrument, establish within one year from the passing of this Act arrangements for the levy from independent television contractors and the BBC of an appropriate sum of money to be determined by him for the showing of feature films on television.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>(8) The Secretary of State shall, by the same order, determine the amounts of and the regulations under which the proceeds of the levy are distributed to makers of British films whose products have been exhibited on television during a qualifying period to be determined by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p>(9) The Secretary of State may appoint a person, or persons, or he may request the tribunal appointed under subsection (11) below to make recommendations to him and to provide other services in connection with the discharge by him of his functions under subsections (7) and (8).</p>

	<p>(10) Any sums required by the Secretary of State for making payments under subsection (8), or for meeting any expenses under subsection (9), shall be paid out of money levied under subsection (7).</p>

	<p>(11) The Secretary of State shall establish within one year of the passing of this Act a films tribunal to which any British film maker may appeal against an unfair price paid by an independent television contractor or the BBC for a feature film intended for exhibition on television.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>

	<p>(12) If in the opinion of the tribunal, a below market or unfair price has been offered by the television operator the tribunal shall have the power to order that a proper price be paid, or any contract be nullified.</p>

	<p>(13) The tribunal shall have the power to listen to a complaint from any British film maker whose product has been exhibited in a British cinema within the previous five years, regardless of whether he has been the maker of the feature film about which the complaint has been made.".</p>

	<p>New clause 2—Extension of levy—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) In section 2(1) of the Film Levy Finance Act 1981, the words 'in respect of—

	<ol>

	<li>the period of 56 weeks beginning on 21 September 1980, and</li>

	<li>each of the four successive periods of 52 weeks following that period' shall he omitted.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>(2) The Secretary of State may by order repeal the Film Levy Finance Act 1981 as from a date specified in the order; but no such order shall be made until legislative provision has been made to guarantee to the film industry, by way of a levy on independent television companies or on pre-recorded or blank video cassettes or otherwise, an annual revenue of not less than £10 million.".</p>

	<p>New clause 3—
	<i>Levy on pre-recorded video cassettes</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall by order establish a scheme to impose a £1 levy on all pre-recorded video cassettes sold in the United Kingdom, the proceeds of which shall be redistributed under the scheme to the makers of British films released on video cassettes, pro rata to their sales in the year in question, in the form of investment credits to be used for the production of British films.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>New clause 6—Levy on Television Companies—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall by order establish a scheme to impose a levy on the BBC and the independent television companies, to be calculated in accordance with the number of relevant films broadcast by each of them each year, the proceeds of which shall be redistributed under the scheme to any person for the purpose of encouraging the production of relevant films as defined in section 3(4).".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>I should draw the attention of hon. Members to the fact that since our last sitting, I have selected new clause 7 for inclusion in this group.</p>

	<p>New clause 7—
	<i>Levy on rental of video recordings</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall by order establish a scheme to impose a levy on the rental of video recordings of over 1 hour in length, the amount to be calculated in accordance with the number of such rentals each year which at current rental levels would raise £ 10 million, the resulting sum to be redistributed under the scheme to any person for the purpose of encouraging the production of relevant films as defined in section 3(4).".</p></blockquote></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My case for replacing the Eady levy with some form of redistributive mechanism, which might include a levy on the television companies, does not, as I was trying to explain to the Committee, depend on any allegation of malevolence or moral culpability on the part of the television companies. The Opposition are saying, as indeed, are other Committee Members, that the television companies, by virtue of the industry's structure, are the natural beneficiaries of much of the production of the feature film industry. That fact alone would, in equity, lead one to look kindly at the principle and, indeed, at some means of securing that principle whereby money was recycled from the television companies not back to the Treasury but back to the film producers themselves. A further point is that the television companies are not just beneficiaries but are in the process of taking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
that benefit—no doubt the unwitting but nevertheless effective agents of destruction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Destruction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —of former cinema audiences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) regards that as a matter of controversy. It is, I think, widely accepted that one of the major factors behind the amazing decline in cinema attendances has been the development of television, which has kept people at home. That is not a charge to be laid against the television companies; it is merely a statement of fact. I make the point simply to reinforce the case in principle and in equity for some such mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the television companies—at least through the Independent Television Companies Association—have properly pointed to the considerable efforts that they themselves make to promote film production, but I would endorse the arguments which the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) and others made for a substantial distinction to be drawn between feature films for the cinema and television productions for showing on the small screen. While it is true that much television money goes into film production for television, it is by no means clear that enough money goes back to the producers of feature films for the cinema.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is on that basis, therefore, that I invite the Minister to consider the case in principle for such a levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much the same argument applies to the industry which produces pre-recorded video cassettes and which is almost entirely built on the large existing library of feature films. That industry is able to benefit commercially from the already existing stock of films. It benefits without having to make any investment of its own. It does not have to plan, take risks or create, and it carries no responsibility for the future of the film production industry. Without any of those considerations, the pre-recorded video cassette industry can build a profit-earning capacity on the basis of what has already been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In both cases—broadcasting and video casettes—the peculiar feature is not that those industries are the beneficiaries of film production, which in itself is not remarkable, but that in the process of benefiting they are actually weakening the very industry that produces their raw material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those bases, I strongly urge the Committee and the Minister to accept the need for a recycling mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, which was so ably moved by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), is fully supported by the Opposition. Certainly, we shall vote for it, and I hope that we shall do so in conjunction with a substantial number of Conservative Members. However, the amendment alone does not necessarily achieve all that we would wish to be achieved, because it would not prevent the end of the levy. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
would merely prevent the Minister from repealing by order the 1981 Act until he had introduced a mechanism for providing a levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the amendment has been made and that the Minister is content to forbear from repealing the 1981 Act. In those circumstances, the levy would still come to an end. Therefore, on its own, the amendment could create a situation in which the levy was at an end with the Minister not being compelled to put anything in its place because he was content to let the Act run on, as it were, to no effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it quite clear to the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) that I accept his reservations about the amendment. If the Committee agreed to the amendment, I would accept his arguments and for the reasons he has given, would support his new clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman because that is exactly the point that I was trying to draw to the Minister's attention. Although we wish to vote for the principle embodied in the amendment, we hope that the Minister will give us a sufficiently firm assurance that he recognises the force of the argument and intends to act accordingly so that we do not need to insist on new clause 2. However, if we feel that the Minister has not taken the argument on board, we shall wish to vote on new clause 2. I am heartened by the remarks made by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, which was moved by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). I also wish to show my support for the other amendments and new clauses that are being discussed with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle that is enshrined in all the amendments and new clauses is simple. It is that having got rid of the Eady levy under the Bill, something else should be put in its place. Several different mechanisms for achieving that end are given in the amendments and new clauses. However, the principle is all important. That is why I very much support the arguments of the hon. Member for Hendon, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, it is worth reminding ourselves that the Eady levy, which, as we have rightly been told, has declined in terms of the amount of money that it produces, initially produced a considerable sum to plough back into the promotion of the British film industry. The very first Eady levy yield of £1.2 million compared with October 1983 prices—the last Eady levy period—would now produce a yield of £10.96 million, just over £10 million of which would have gone to film, the remainder going to the Children's Film and Television Foundation. That is the background against which our debate takes place. The original Eady levy would have yielded £10 million for British film today if that levy were producing the same sum in real terms as it was when first introduced. We must examine what is happening now against that background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I indicated on Second Reading that I have no particular quarrel with scrapping the Eady levy. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
quarrel is with the Government's failure to put anything realistic in its place. It is worth reminding ourselves, particularly in the context of new clause 2, that three different kinds of levy have been proposed. I appreciate that we cannot discuss in detail one or two aspects of those levies and that amendment No. 39 relates to the proposal for a levy on films shown on television. But the three options which have been discussed and booted around in all conversations and debates on the subject are levies on films shown on televison; pre-recorded video cassettes and blank tapes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, we must look at the proposed levy for films shown on television and the two major reasons why such levies are being proposed. First, and most important, the levy must raise sufficient money to plough back into the promotion of British films. My hon. Friends do not regard the Government's proposals as sufficient for the promotion of British films. We want to see money raised from the use of British films and from films produced by the film industry. We also want to see the money raised from their use being ploughed back into further production. That is the first principle. Secondly, there is the principle of copyright—again I appreciate that we cannot discuss that in detail—and of having some return from the film industry, from the use of its products for those who are not part of the production of films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the specific point about a levy on films on television. The hon. Member for Hendon, North said, in his able introduction to the amendment, that there were 4 billion individual film viewings on television each year in this country as compared with 66 million cinema admissions. That is an instructive comparison because it demonstrates clearly that the vast majority of film viewing, takes place in the living room rather than in the cinema. I accept everything that was said in our earlier debates about the value of big screen viewing and the great difference between viewing a film in the cinema and viewing it on television. But that does not detract from the important fact that far more people watch films on television in their living rooms than go to the cinema.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A breakdown of viewing between the channels shows that in 1983, 786 films were shown on BBC 1 and BBC 2; 350 films were shown on ITV's main channel and 380 on Channel 4, totalling about 1,500 films shown on television in that year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that the buying-in price of those films is remarkably low and does not contribute significantly to the cost of production. The sale of films to television companies contributes around 6 per cent. to the cost of production. If the number of people who watch films on television is compared with the number who watch them in the cinema, the difference is extremely significant and makes for cheap and easy television for the television companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Christmas period is approaching when that point will be amply demonstrated. Not only do films provide an easy mechanism by which television companies can use up time and not only are they a cheap form of doing so, but they are also popular with the public. The viewing figures for films—especially feature films—shown on television are consistently
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
high. It is clear that a contribution should be made by television to the films industry for that priceless asset which the television companies receive and use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lot of dumping in this country of American-made films for showing on television. When packages of films are bought, many are bought at very low prices and put some money back in the American film industry. That means not only that we buy and view American products, but that our homegrown British products do not get the attention they deserve from television audiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a very strong argument for some sort of recompense from the television companies and perhaps from television viewers, although the precise mechanism whereby a levy is introduced is a matter for discussion. I hope that the Government will respond in detail to that point if the amendment is accepted. Some recompense is required from the television industry to the film industry in respect of the large scale and, at the moment, very cheap use made of films by television companies. That is an important argument and should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 takes us further than amendment No. 39, which I also support and hope to vote for. The new clause specifies that the revenue to be received from whatever mechanism the Secretary of State introduces for a levy on the use of films, should be a minimum of £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see a much higher figure, but £10 million would at least give some degree of security and a ground base for the promotion of British films and would approximately equal the amount raised when the Eady levy was first introduced. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says, and I shall try to catch your eye again, Mr. Crowther. if I am disappointed by his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point which I wish to make involves the relative cost of programming on television. If we consider television and its own product—that is, its own material—we find that the average hourly cost is for ITV £100,000, for BBC 1 and BBC 2 f90,000 and for Channel 4 £35,000. But if we compare that with the average cost of feature films bought in by BBC and ITV we see—it must be remembered that most of them last for much longer than an hour—that for the BBC the sum is £6,000 and for ITV £7,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That demonstrates graphically the difference in cost to the television companies of buying in feature films, and shows that in terms of recompense made to the film industry for the talent, energy and effort which goes into the production of films, extremely low amounts are paid by television. The amendments and new clauses are pleading for—I hope this will not fall on deaf ears—greater recognition from the Government of the necessary tribute from television, and perhaps from other sources, to ensure that the film industry can produce films, thrive and flourish. I hope that the Government will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) has produced some telling figures to support the amendments, which I support in principle. When I spoke at our first sitting, I addressed a question to my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
hon. Friend the Minister—namely, do the Government want to see continued in this country the production of middle-range budget feature films of a British nature? I am paraphrasing the question, as I cannot remember it exactly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendments we propose various ways in which the Government could positively help in that activity: amendment No. 39 merely asks them to accept a principle. I suspect that the Government's reluctance—I do not know whether this will apply at the end of the debate—to accept the principle is clouded by two factors: first, that there will be some sort of increase in public spending and taxation and secondly, that the proposal will be regarded unfavourably by the television companies. Certainly, there are emanations from both the BBC and the Independent Television Companies Association which show that television companies are still against the idea of paying some sort of levy on feature films shown on their channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were the Government to insist on this levy, they would, in the long run, help the television companies and the BBC to preserve an area of programming which will otherwise rapidly disappear. The supply of British films has been severely limited over the past decade and more, and when one considers some of the films which purport to be British one knows perfectly well that they cannot be shown on public television. Therefore, one day the television planners, who, I suspect, are looking only towards tomorrow, rather than three days, three years or five years ahead, will find that their supplies have dried up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that most members of the Committee have received a letter from the Independent Television Companies Association. It claims that the ITV companies are actively engaged in the production of films and that, of course, they give huge support to the film industry. The ITCH, in the shape of its general secretary, Mr. David Shaw, who wrote the letter, is absolutely right. There is probably more work for film technicians in this country than ever before as a result of television. The labs are busy, the editors are busy, the dubbing suites are busy and the cameramen are busy, but, of course, it will always remain a job that involves high unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people who work for television are not making the sort of films that the Committee is trying to protect. There is a claim in the letter, which I know some people believe to be right, that Channel 4 is the way in which the ITV companies are supporting the feature film industry, because many excellent 90-minute or so long-feature films have been made for it. However, if you, Mr. Crowther, had seen many of those films you would quickly understand that, excellent though they are, they are not made with the primary purpose of showing them in cinema theatres. They are made to be shown on television in the hope that some will be transferred, secondarily, to cinema theatres. But they are films that are different from those that will disappear from this country unless something is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people have written excellent papers on the ultimate death, or possibly life after death, to quote the Boulting Brothers, of the British film industry. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
turned up a memorandum from Mr. Bryan Forbes that was sent to the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts when we were considering our report on the private and public funding of the arts in the last Parliament. I am sure that the Committee knows that for a time Mr. Bryan Forbes was managing director and head of production of EMI studios and that he has been a most successful producer, director and, of course, actor. He is someone who knows a great deal about the state of the British film industry and I wish to bring one or two of his remarks to the attention of the Committee. He made matters plain in his memorandum of 28 May 1981, and I do not believe that the position has changed. The memorandum said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To have a viable native industry, capable of making films that can compete in the world market, we must somehow attract finance of the order of £50,000,000 a year which, properly allocated amongst responsible film-makers of proven track record, would finance at least 20 full length feature films."</p></blockquote>
I would not say, and I am sure Mr. Forbes would not say, that we look to a levy to produce £50 million. The purpose of the levy is to create a fund which is large enough to result in the rest of the money coming from other investors. It is well known that the City of London in its cautious and—dare I say it as a half-Scot—almost Scottish way is reluctant to put its money into high risk investment. Small portions come from one or two institutions, including, I believe, at one stage the National Union of Mineworkers' pension fund, but not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister agrees with me that the Government want the continued production of middle-range budget feature films for cinema theatres, our task as a Committee is to change the mind of the cautious investor from surveying what might be described as a double high-risk investment to surveying something slightly less risky—possibly only a high-risk investment—because any investment of this nature is risky, and we know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments contain different proposals. In fact, there is almost an infinity of choice. The Select Committee went for a levy of 0.25p per viewer of feature films on television. It was calculated that that would produce about £10 million a year. I believe that we should go further. The target should be about £20 million—about double the amount—with about 0.5p per viewer per year. Based on the audience research figures of the number of viewers who watch feature films, that would produce a fund of roughly £20 million. With that as a base, the administrators of the fund—I shall not pursue this line too far, but I shall assume that it would be the son of NFFC, if I may so call it—would have every chance, which they do not have now, with the puny amount suggested, of attracting high-risk capital, because it had substantial backing for its own funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The high-risk investor will not put all his money in high-risk investments or in one investment. He has to spread the load. This is one way in which we can encourage him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a novel suggestion. Many hon. Members have said that the French have such a system, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
they calculate it on the numbers of people in audiences watching films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer briefly to the question of blank tapes and to pre-recorded video tapes for hire or rent for features. In my view, it is not right to consider a levy on blank tapes, but wherever a feature film is exhibited it is absolutely right to impose some form of levy to help the film production industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, in conclusion, that there was a problem with the Eady levy. In the end, most of the Eady money was not ploughed back into the production of British films. It went by various means—deals with the distributors, and in other ways—into other hands, and very little of the money arrived on the studio floor with the next production. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister, in considering the matter, will take a leaf out of the French book, where the equivalent of Eady money has to be spent on production within a certain time, otherwise the money is forfeit. In that way, we could guarantee that the film makers got proper base funding, which would attract risk investment money and bring life back, even after death, to this branch of the British film industry which, despite the protests of the television industry, is very near to death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that perhaps the best way is to have a simple levy—not a complicated levy that is tied to the number of films shown on the television screen and the average viewing audience on any particular night, which makes it complicated and expensive to collect? Would it not be better simply to say to the television companies, whether BBC or ITV, that there will be a levy of, say, a farthing—to use an old-fashioned word—or 0.25p per known viewer per annum? It would be a simple, straightforward levy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put forward what he considers to be a simple, straightforward suggestion, but as he outlined it, I thought how complicated it would quickly become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is a count of a typical BBC viewer? New audience research would have to be done. Is the typical viewer someone who turns on his set, which happens automatically to go to channel 1, but because he never watches channel I he switches through? Does he register in the British Audience Research Bureau ratings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some attraction for me in going for audience research ratings as a measurement. We are not talking of a tax or indeed of public spending. The cinema fan is contributing something to his own enjoyment and it is the only way in which we can create a fund to continue that enjoyment. Such a person is identifiable as near as possible through audience ratings as being a cinema fan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Eady levy had its perfection in that in the captive situation of a cinema where the seat was paid for and there was a behind in that seat, so to speak, it was clear that the person in that seat was a cinema fan. He may not have liked a particular film, but it was right that he contributed. We are making clear to those who wish this type of entertainment to be preserved that the only way that we can see of creating funds to continue a viable British industry
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
is through a levy or contribution from showings on television and the hiring or renting of features on video cassettes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must be right about audience ratings being the best guide, because this happens to be one rating which the television companies accept.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The whole television industry is geared to working out ratings to find out how much advertisers are to be asked to pay and how much they will pay their contributors in residual fees, and so on. It would not be difficult in this era of information technology to take the simple figures of how many people watch each feature film and calculate the contribution from that. It is almost simpler than the scheme suggested by the hon. Member for St Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add briefly to what I said on Second Reading and at the second sitting of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that I supported a levy on television films for a reason which I believe to be clear. Although the Eady levy is disastrous to the modern cinema audience, it was a good idea at the time. It reflected the way in which films were shown in that era. It reflected audiences in their millions —I believe that audience participation reached 1 billion in the earliest days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as television became more popular and channel numbers increased, and as the video industry sprouted, there was a transition from people viewing films in the cinema to viewing them at home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a tragedy that there is such a dearth of people in cinemas. The difference between cinema and video is that films made for the cinema are quite wonderful in the cinema but are much less of a spectacle on television. The Bill increases the danger that an industry will be established which produces excellent, brilliantly produced and directed films, in which the acting also is brilliant, for television, and that films made for the cinema will gradually die out. The only way we can continue to support the cinema film industry is to accept that the audience which enjoys
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
the spin-off from the cinema industry by watching those films on television ought to contribute to the greater good of the cinema film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The film "Chariots of Fire", which I saw in the cinema and at home, was not the spectacle at home that it was in the cinema, but those who benefited by watching the film on television and enjoying its story and presentation, should encourage the British film industry to make such films for the great spectacle that they provide. A film shown in the cinema can be great art; a film shown on television, while it can be art, is more likely to be a fairly transient experience. Therefore, the great films, when seen on television and video, are not a spectacle at all, more a half experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use video and watch it regularly, not only because of the time changes of ordinary programmes but to catch up on films that I have missed in the cinema. That is an important and useful function of video. But I have seen on television films which have made me try to find time to see them in the cinema—the medium for which they were made—to listen to the sound and to envelop myself in the atmosphere of the cinema.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the Government's view. I have said that Eady was relevant in its day and I think that is relevant now. But I believe that the levy should be raised from the audience which watches feature films. I go further than my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton), in saying that there should be a levy on blank tapes because that would be fair. There are many films a levy on which, when they are shown by BBC or ITV, could benefit the film production industry. I also think that repeated showing should be reflected in a levy on the video shops and on blank tapes. I do not believe that it is right that for £1.00 or £1. 50, a person may take home a pre-recorded video and watch it, and that the sum that he pays should benefit only the video shop owner or the video distributor. I believe that a levy should be paid to the company which produces the film each time it is shown on television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our second sitting, I said that I thought the Eady levy should have been scrapped much earlier, but that it should be replaced by a levy on television companies and blank tapes. I also mentioned audio tapes, which are outside our present parameters. Therefore, I must support the amendment, not only because it is consistent with my earlier remarks, but because it is consistent with the wishes of many of my constituents—among whom are many film producers. Indeed, my constituency is attractive for that -reason and its value has been enhanced. My support for the amendment is consistent also with my family history. We must try to encourage the film industry, and not merely to replace existing structures. The Bill is valuable, but it is not sufficiently valuable to give the industry confidence, which I believe we ought to do. Our cinema film production industry is one of Britain's greatest assets and we should encourage it by giving it this vote of confidence and supporting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about amendments which seek to help the film industry. When I was appointed to the Committee I thought that the Films Bill would attempt to benefit the film industry. On Bills dealing with matters such as the abolition of bear baiting it was the express desire of the Committee then involved to put an end to an evil. But in this case I believe the Films Bill seeks to do something for the film industry. Incidentally, enormously welcome the Minister's return to the Committee Room. He has missed much, but if he remains in his place he will hear more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading many of us made it clear that the Eady levy had clearly outgrown its usefulness. The Government's argument that the useless Eady levy would be replaced with a sum of money that was twice the inadequate sum previously raised would not have cheered the heart of anyone in the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled new clause 7 which you, Mr. Crowther, have properly seen fit to include in this group of amendments. Like the other amendments, it is a probing one. The new clause gives the Government yet another opportunity of saying to the film industry that, for some reason close to their hearts but inexplicable to many of us on the Opposition Benches, they cannot support or live with the capital allowances that the film industry would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we must suggest to the Government ways in which they can encourage the film industry to continue producing films. I agree with the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) who said that films in cinema are quite different from films watched on television. If the hon. Gentleman came to my office and saw me watching snooker on a 10-in black and white television he would realise what a different experience that is even from watching snooker on a 27-in colour television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to impose a levy on tape rentals, which would be redistributed to film makers. At this sitting we have discussed the principle of recycling funds from one end of the film industry to another. The purpose of the new clause is acceptance of that principle, and the realisation that there may be valid objections to a levy on tapes. I shall not take up the Committee's time by going into detail, but, there are substantial objections to a levy on blank tapes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
The new clause also contends, that there is a relationship between video rental and film production, that one lives off the material produced by the other, and that the low cost of renting a film does not give sufficient reward to the film maker. The argument is one of social conscience because not only is it in the interests of the video rental business to help the production side, it has a duty to do so, especially as a levy would help the young and avant-garde film makers whose material may be worthwhile but not mainstream rental material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Films constitute 81 per cent. of material rented and sold pre-recorded in the last year for which figures are available. Video now has a 30 per cent. penetration of British homes but it has not generally been a major source of finance for film making. I accept that Channel 4 has changed that situation fractionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rental of video films falls into the category of exploiting film material at low cost, or at a price that is not representative of the cost of producing the original material. Therefore, such a levy would not add much to the price of renting a film, which at present is about U. It would provide for what the hon. Member for Dagenham described in our previous sitting as the urgent need for an internal recycling mechanism which gives money to those who make the material and bring profits for other people. It would also avoid doubts about a levy on blank tapes. However, the emphasis must be on the need for film production and on the failure by the Government to come up with a satisfactory suggestion for solving the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us are waiting for the Minister to give us some sort of hope. I remind him that the idea of the Films Bill is to encourage the film industry and to salute those who despite great difficulties imposed on them by successive Governments have done far better than this and previous Parliaments had any right to expect. We hope that the Government, with their knowledge of industry—although perhaps not of the film industry—will give careful thought to a sector that is prestigious and of which we are immensely proud, which does great good for the nation and which probably does some of the work of the British Council and the British overseas programme for them by waving the flag. We look to the Government for a means whereby an industry which is strapped for money will receive their consent to raising and spending money, and continue providing enjoyment and education for many people throughout the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale (Thanes, North)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud), having cycled and recycled around the problem, came back to where we started. In other words, this is the Films Bill, not a Television Bill, and we should concern ourselves with the film industry, not the television industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly surprised to find so many of my hon. Friends claiming that the Government must support the film industry. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) said that the only way that the money could be raised was by some kind of levy. But I dispute that. I do not believe that that is the only way or indeed the most proper way
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
to finance the film industry. It will not surprise the Committee to learn that I feel that it should be done through private enterprise. If there is to be a healthy film industry in this country, ultimately it should be private investors—putting their money where their mouths are—who fund it. Again, if a private and independent cinema circuit is to be maintained here, that will largely depend on private money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall support amendment No. 39 because of a principle. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said that the principle was to seek a recognition of the film industry from the Government, but I do not believe that. I feel that what is proposed is a tax on the television industry. The principle that I wish to see in the Bill is recognition by one industry of its dependence on another. My view, which I expressed during the Cable and Broadcasting Bill, is that independent television and the BBC—and latterly the video tape industry—have for far too long been parasites on the film industry and have paid very little for what they have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Figures have been bandied around; as a television producer, my rule of thumb was £1,000 a minute, or £60,000 an hour. However, the figure seems to be somewhere between £50,000 and £100,000 an hour. As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, if one divides such a figure by the amount paid for British films and then calculates the hours of screen time that television has given to them, one finds that they are very cheap television. I do not believe that that is necessarily bad, nor do I feel that it is improper that films popular with the public should be seen on television. Indeed, that is highly desirable. Again, I do not draw the distinction that has been made by some between films made for television—which seem to be in some way suspect—and blockbusters, which seem to be in some way better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his great experience of television production, my hon. Friend must admit that if something is being made for the small screen, different techniques are used. To put the record straight, the Government can create a climate but in no way was I looking for Government expenditure and I hope that he will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that. I also accept that if one happens to be making a film in scope, different techniques are applied. However, the fundamentals of film making and the fundamental attraction of the visual quality of what appears on either the big screen or the small screen are one and the same and I do not draw any distinction in respect of films made for television. Indeed, there are television companies—the company for which I worked is an honourable example—which have film subsidiaries that make excellent films both for television and, feeding off their own product in television series, the cinema, and they are continuing to do very nicely, thank you, out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to see films on television; we shall want to see films on cable television very soon, and an increasingly large number of people want to see films on video. I believe that most members of the Committee want to see British Films whenever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
possible. In the Cable and Broadcasting Bill we opposed, rightly, I believe, the imposition of a quota. I do not believe that the independent television companies or the BBC should be compelled to buy a mediocre product from an independent company merely to satisfy a sort of quota. Equally, as I said, I do not believe that independent television companies and the BBC should be compelled to take mediocre in-house productions merely because the craft unions in the television industry say that they should. I should like to think that the independent television companies and the BBC were able to purchase in an open market, and if they were, it seems entirely proper that they should pay a fair price for the product. The whole gist of my contribution is that I do not believe that they have paid a fair price so far. Both the independent companies and the BBC have purchasing cartels which they use to force down the price of the product they buy. That is bad for the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I believe that we were right to resist the quota and we are rightly resisting state funding for the film industry, but it would be quite wrong to resist this attempt to coerce independent television companies, the BBC and the video tape companies into paying for what they are getting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale) said at the beginning of his remarks, but I am sorry that he suggested that the Government should adopt the amendment. He seems to have fallen prey to the idea that what happened in the past, namely, that the television companies got their films on the cheap, is what is happening now and will continue to happen in future. I believe that the world in which I live is entirely different from that depicted by my hon. Friend and by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), who talked of movies that were purchased. He said that feature films had been purchased at an average cost of £6,000 by the BBC and £7,000 by ITV. Does the hon. Gentleman know how much was paid for "Chariots of Fire" to be shown on television? The payment was $2 million. Does he know how much was paid for "Star Wars" to be shown on British television? The amount was $4 million and for "Champion" it was $500,000. I am not talking about the number of screens on which those films were shown but their price, because that has an important bearing on what has been said today on both sides of the Committee. The price paid is a good one and it goes into the British movie industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for saying that the Minister should not adopt, as a panic measure, the suggestions put by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee is based on a simple proposition. There never was a time in the history of British movie making when it was more able to make a profit than now. The future is not one of despair because there never was a time when there were more opportunities to make profits and good movies as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend calculate the cost per person of the purchase of those films for showing

In those happy days of his youth when he used to buy 1s 6d worth of dark at the back of a cinema—no doubt waiting for the lights to brighten for the mighty Wurlitzer organ—was he conscious that his payment had contributed to the movie industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does he now feel guilty as he sits in front of his television screen knowing that he is watching, as he believes, for free? Does he really believe that we should somehow, as ordinary individuals, pay our money—which my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tell my hon. Friend that 20 years ago, when he was an even younger man than he looks now, in a debate about the film industry, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because of the talent which lies in the young producers, directors, actors and technicians, our film industry potentially has a great future, but the men who are concerned with the financial manipulations and combinations of the industry are throttling it."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1964; Vol. 688, c.1089.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend was talking about the duopoly in the film industry. Today, we are talking about the duopoly in his television industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard such an astoundingly irrelevant quotation in n my life. The duopoly position that we are in is far more competitive. Does anyone really believe that from the prices I have quoted a duopoly is screwing down the people who made "Chariots of Fire"? That is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is referring to past occasions where television was approached by the gentlemen from Hollywood who produced a lovely package. One good feature film was taken with 20 B, C and D films at a knock-down price. We have now, of course, exhausted the archives of most movies made in the 1930s by Paramount and others. But that is the world in which we lived. I am talking about the world in which we live now and the world of the future. That is not the world that I described in 1964 and it is not the world described by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee today. It is a world to be approached with direct broadcasting by satellite in which there will be pay-TV home boxes for cable and video recordings which people will buy avidly rather than going to the flea pit round the corner, which used to give so much pleasure to my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a problem for the television industry. It is a problem for the movie industry, which should move with the times. The movie industry knows that it is riddled with restrictive practices. The way in which some studios make movies is disgraceful and they must pull their fingers out. There is no reason in this new era to encourage them to believe that they can exist in the same way as they did in the thirties, or immediately after the war. The industry has changed and I have described the new opportunities that exist. But hon. Members do not refer to them because they are still sunk in the past. If they mention television helping the movie industry they say, "But television is not the real art form.".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is what the customers like. I do not know if many of them would notice the degree of difference between the "Chariots of Fire" film seen on television and the one seen at the cinema. If people notice an enormous difference, it is up to them to pay to go to the cinema. I would appreciate that difference. But hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are missing the argument. There is an enormous convergence of style between making the cinema film and making the television film. It was not that many years ago that the television film was not regarded by many as having much to do with film-making. Nor was it considered to have an art form that could be respected. However, that is untrue now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, the old 16mm camera was considered to be too clapped-out for making a good quality movie. No one wanted to use it because it was not good enough. Recently, however, as we all know, the 16mm camera has reached a high definition standard. Moreover, the equipment that goes with it enables a quality of film to be made by producers for television for which they would have given their eye teeth years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new technology and the cheaper method of making films has resulted in film producers being attracted to film-making for television, because television has exploited the new technology. Furthermore, with that has come the creative abilities of those who now make films, which are enjoyable and acceptable for the cinema as well as for television. No one thinks of those films as degraded products now. For those who wish to read about it there is a technical description in the current edition of "A Guide to Independent Television and Radio Broadcasting 1985".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee with a technical lecture. There is neither time, nor do I wish to be presumptuous. However, I beg hon. Members to look at the changes. Channel 4 is a good example. Such people as Vanessa Redgrave, Anna Massey and Julie Walters appear in modest budget films produced by Channel 4 which are to be seen next year. They would not appear in films made only for the tiny box. Those films are worthy of being seen in the cinema. In fact, 50 per cent. of the films being funded by Channel 4 are filmed with the express purpose of being shown in the cinema, not only on television. Some of them —"The Draughtsman's Contract" and others—have achieved high acclaim by film critics throughout the world on their merits as films fit for the cinema. That gives an entirely different picture from that

May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look at the matter in another way. I want him to resist the amendments and new clauses. I hope that he will do so with confidence, knowing that he need have no bad attack of loyal conscience. Television is far from being parasitical, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who is most cautious in his use of words and, to boot, a courteous man. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North used the word "Rachmanism" when speaking about the activities of television.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy for my hon. Friend to do so. We are discussing something that I did 20 years ago. My hon. Friend seems to be living in the past. Moreover, his own comments, let alone his habit of quoting mine, show that he is doing so. I have moved on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry has not sucked off the lifeblood. On the contrary, television, by its in-house productions for television using new film techniques and by assisting the film industry, as has Channel 4 and other companies to the tune of many millions of pounds, has helped to keep alive the very skills of the technicians, the laboratories, the dramatists and actors to which the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) paid so eloquent and sincere a tribute. They, and television of course, have provided a domestic mass audience for all types of film production which is why I have no objections to such films, being watched by millions of people. The commercial cinema has not got that mass audience, and never has had in Britain. We have always had a rather lame duck film industry because, with a too small market, we have never been able to compete with the Americans. That is why the film-going public in this country of the generation of my hon. Friends and myself were brought up and weaned on Myrna Loy and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were occasional periods when Ealing comedies and other productions shone through like a beacon light and we thought that the industry was having another revival, but in the end it could not be sustained. In so far as we have been able to sustain a British movie industry, it has been due partly to the guts, brains and determination of people, and partly due to some producers, such as David Puttnam and companies like Goldcrest, getting their act together
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
and understanding that, if they are to get private capital, the British film industry must behave not so much like a high risk industry but more like a responsible one. I know that those are harsh words, because there are many highly responsible people in the British film industry, but it is a high risk and, frankly, much of the money has been wasted. The industry has not been as stable as it could have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, a television company has a broad range of productions. It can spread its talents and its costs over a broad range. There are times when it wants to make a prestigious production such as "Jewel in the Crown" costing hundreds of thousands of pounds. A cynic said that television companies make such programmes only when they think that their licence is up for grabs, but they do spread the load fairly well. That applies to the BBC as well. But that is not the pattern of production in the film industry. We know what happens. Someone has an idea, buys the story, gets the talent around to recreate it for the screen, the actors are engaged and the money is somehow found and is spent. Either a profit or loss is made but, whatever happens, the organisation formed for that production is either put on the back burner or disbanded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure is wrong, but now the film industry has an opportunity. David Puttnam, if he were here, would recognise it as do many others. They know that they are no longer making films for the single market—the duopoly of distribution, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North rightly referred, with all the problems that it has posed for British film makers. The industry could now have the opportunity to break out of that stranglehold, because of tape and the home box-office. Plenty of people all over the world buy tape and pay-as-youview, and it is coming here. Therefore, the cinema as such is of less importance to them. There is the far greater opportunity of a steady stream of income, much of which is provided by those who work in television and recognise the value of the film to television and, who at the same time know that there are people in the movie industry who recognise the new skills which the artistic television people have brought to their world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point ought to be mentioned in this context. The very popular films like "Star Wars" are not the British ones that we have been talking about and want to support. We know that "Star Wars" was an American concept and financed by American money but its producers came here because we have the talent to make such films—and that applies to the Bond films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we have the talent? In part, it has to do with television. As I said earlier, television has helped to keep in work people who would otherwise be out of work. Moreover, it has helped to maintain skills and foster skills which otherwise we should not have had. It also has something to do with our geography—but not the geography of the cinema in "Muddle-combe", which makes little contribution to the artistic or financial strength of the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me illustrate my argument. Anyone who makes
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
a film in Hollywood knows that he is 3,000 miles away from New York where much of the finance is and where the wheeling and dealing has to be done. Moreover, he is 3,000 miles away from such legitimate stage as exists in the United States, and he is 6,000 miles away from the drama centre of the world. Anyone making films in this country has the best broadcasting organisations on his doorstep, as well as the best theatre—thank goodness, because those people have courage and vision, and have kept the skills alive. So we have the finest framework that is possible for anyone making movies—with perhaps one exception, France, which suffers from a language problem, although people there make up for it through their own creative ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Artists and technicians move from film to television. Actors and actresses move from film to television and to theatre. They are telling us—it does not seem to have got through to members of this Committee—that the division between film and television has narrowed and this is having an effect, thank goodness, on the structure of the film industry. Hon. Member's do not appreciate that change—the coming together of the two media, and the contribution that television has made to the vitality of film making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as television has harmed film making, it has harmed it because it has replaced the cinema as a habit. However, it has not destroyed British film making. On the contrary, it has nourished it. The answer does not necessarily lie with the television industry. It is for those who operate cinemas to run them better, to fight back and to become more attractive and competitive. In the same way, it is the duty of film makers and the companies behind them to make films in new ways, with the new financial structures that are now possible, instead of expecting investment from the City, on old fashioned principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of some people in television—I respect their views—can be summed up in this way. To develop some form of cross-funding from a levy on television or film-showing television in the United Kingdom could be said to be wrong on three counts. First, it is illogical, because most of the films that are shown on television are not British. So that would not help the British industry very much. Secondly, it is inflationary. If the cost of the levy were not deducted from normal expenditure on original work, the cost would have to be paid for by the consumer. At present the BBC is fighting over the cost of its licence fee, and one can imagine the effect of a levy imposed on the organisation. Thirdly, it is misdirected. If people still think of television as a milch cow, even after a deduction of 66 per cent. of its profits by a Government levy, as well as corporation tax, I remind them that ahead lies the challenge to our television companies of competing with tape and cable and of trying to finance direct broadcasting by satellite, which offers even greater opportunities for the British film industry. The cost of direct broadcasting by satellite will be great. The last figure I saw was about £400 million, and I should not be surprised if it had not doubled since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An industry faced with that challenge—and the others that I have mentioned, including the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
fragmentation of its audience—is not likely to look kindly on the amendments that have been proposed. We should recognise that times have changed. I cannot conclude better than by quoting the following words—I did not ask the author's permission to give his name:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The future for film makers in Britain will come, in the long term, only from film-making being, overall, profitable. The market for films is poor, in terms of opportunities presented by UK cinema, and is difficult to penetrate internationally—but the same is true for the products of much of British industry. by encouraging and developing creative talents combined with commercial skills to overcome these obstacles, as I think is envisaged in the Films Bill, will the film industry become adequately profitable."</p></blockquote>
I concur wholeheartedly with that comment. Television, as a broadcasting medium, needs to work with films rather than being seen to be harmful to films. I understand if people are anxious, as the funding in the Bill begins to diminish and run out, about what will replace the funding. I understand the degree of uncertainty facing those in the film industry and the problems. However, if we look purely to television as a crock of gold to save them, we shall be taking a disastrous path that will destroy both the British film industry and British television.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to imagine how it must have felt to be a Labour Minister in a minority Government. I told the Committee earlier of my tremendous inhibitions about coming into this area where many of my hon. Friends have so much expertise, knowledge and experience. I have been impressed by, and have listened carefully to, what has been said. However, non-expert I may be, I sometimes think that someone coming into a specialised world where there are many experts can sometimes see very clearly the principles that should be applied and the world of those experts as it really is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should keep a sense of proportion about the state of the British film industry. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) said. To hear some of the comments of hon. Members, one would think that the film industry was on its last legs. In fact, it is in a relatively healthy state and I do not believe that it views its own future with the pessimism that has been expressed by some members of the Committee. I recently attended the launch of the British Film Year and met many people from the industry. The message put forward then was one of confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the House on Second Reading about the number of major producers who have announced important programmes. For example, Goldcrest recently raised £20 million for new film projects. I do not believe that if raising money is as difficult and precarious as hon. Members have said, the industry will be helped by the rather exaggerated message that has gone out from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is not sick with obsolescent skills and products. We are not discussing redundancies and unemployment. The industry is doing well, studio space is at a premium and more people are employed in the industry now than for years. I am told at one moment that I can claim credit and at the next moment that the things that I claim credit for are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
happening. I am not claiming credit for anything, but I believe I am entitled to make observations about the state of the industry and the exaggerated pessimism that has come forth from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is not dependent on hugh injections of public money as my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden said. It is a strength of the British film industry that it is located in the world of commercial disciplines. That is part of its strength. The industry must be orientated towards a market to be successful. I have felt at times that there was a hankering on the part of Opposition Members—this is the only partisan point I shall make—for minority films. To hear some Opposition Members talk, one would think that the fuller the cinema the worse the film. If the industry is to be successful it has to be directed towards a market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What of the future? As my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) said, there is a huge expanding market-place. There is cable, and DBS will come into operation. The EEC estimates that 125,000 hours of fiction will be needed within the Community each year by the end of the 1980s, compared with 100,000 hours of the present combined annual production rate of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, for cinemas, and between 3,000 and 4,000 hours for television. As my hon. Friend said, there is tremendous growth in the market and an enormous challenge and opportunity opening up. When there is such growth and such great opportunity, it is rather odd to argue that a levy is needed between customers and the supplier as opposed to the usual commercial negotiations between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes of course. But, firstly the capital allowance with regard to the industry has only been in existence since 1979. It was always intended that it would go, and the film industry has known that. Secondly, there are concessions for the industry even within the new tax regime. Not everyone whom I meet from the film industry is as rude about these tax concessions, at least in private, as many members of the Committee have been in public. I meet people who say that they are of value to them. It has been said here that the business expansion scheme being applied to films is irrelevant to the industry. But the film industry asked for it and we gave it. My hon. Friend is aware that limited capital allowances still apply, as well as a system for accelerated write-off and cost recovery. Those are definite concessions to the film industry within the new regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to take care to identify who needs assistance, and why. There has been much talk in Committee of where money could come from, but there has been little analysis of how it should be spent, and who we are trying to help. Are we trying to help new talent, or merely to improve the position of present established producers? The White Paper identified four areas of special need. The first was the National Film and Television School, where support is being raised not by levy but by voluntary agreements with commercial and other interests. We have announced our arrangements for the British Film Institute production fund, as well as arrangements for the script development fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New talent has in the past been greatly helped by the NFFC and it is intended that such help will be given in future, by the son of NFFC. The arrangements arrived at have been achieved not by a levy but by an understanding with certain interests. We have managed to obtain more than double the money available via the Eady levy for that son of NFFC. Of course there is room for others to contribute if they want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the arrangements announced in the White Paper we have addressed the question of where the need lies, and in respect of new talent and experimental films we are doing more than has been done in recent years. However, it is important to ask who will be helped by the amendments, and why. In essence, there are two types of levy—one aimed at recompensing copyright owners and another, in which the hon. Member for Dagenham is more interested, that is redistributed by taking it from one industry and giving it to another, instead of the usual commercial relationship. But for the reasons that I have hinted at I have grave doubts about whether in the present climate, and in view of the changes going on and the expansion of the market, that is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked to come clean about the Eady levy and to say whether I felt that it had worked well. Although I very much doubt whether it would be desirable to devise such a levy today, it is difficult to say what my attitude would have been when it was invented. Nevertheless, that mechanism has done considerable harm to the cinema, and I believe that there is a danger that, through some of the devices proposed in the amendments, mistakes could be repeated in respect of new forms of media. The Eady levy was redistributive and a means of recycling money from the exhibition sector—mainly from American films —into the production of British films. Of course in practice quite a lot of the money tended to go to the American distributors anyway. It should be borne in mind when discussing levies that what is intended
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
does not necessarily work out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the various propositions that have been advanced, and I should like to make my observations about who the beneficiaries will be and about some of the drawbacks. Let us first consider briefly the copyright levy, which has been touched on. Such a levy is to be the subject of a consultative document; a Green paper will be published next month. I sympathise with the idea of that levy but matters are complicated, and video tapes and—dare I mention them in the context of this Committee—audio tapes will be affected. The hon. Member for Dagenham said that I should not try to shelter behind the consultative document. However, with the greatest respect to him, it is rather absurd to suggest that I should anticipate the outcome of the consultations. We are always being told that consultations undertaken by any Government are a sham, but it would certainly look as though these consultations had not been genuine if I leapt to certain conclusions now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the responses that we receive we shall consider whether the levy should merely be paid to copyright holders. We shall also examine the necessary machinery and the possibility of setting up some sort of central fund to be used in the film industry to support production. We shall have to see what comes out of the consultations, but the level and extent of such a levy would have to be consistent with copyright criteria; it must not be an arbitrary tax, as is recommended in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have not really been talking about a copyright levy, nor is it what the hon. Member for Dagenham is really interested in. He is interested in a redistributive levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was one of the matters considered in the Government's review of film policy. Many representations were received and hon. Members will recall that in paragraphs 5.8 and 5.9 the White Paper dealt with that subject and spelt out the Government's response to those representations. First, it made the point that we do not believe that statutory recycling mechanisms are an efficient way of encouraging an activity that should really be oriented towards the market—an expanding market. Secondly, the White Paper stated that the argument that the original Eady system was efficient because it rewarded success, cannot be used to promote arrangements for siphoning off returns from commercially successful productions to make films that would otherwise not attract market finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper also stated that the Government should not intervene by introducing a television film levy that would increase the costs both of the BBC, with consequent implications for the television licence fee, and of the ITV companies. I shall speak about those propositions in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that has been made again and again during our debate is the so-called duopoly. It has been argued that at present the purchase of films for television is subject to a duopoly that operates to the detriment of independent film producers. It is said that the BBC and ITV companies together control the market and pay too little for the films they show. Obviously there is a duopoly, but the question of prices is a matter of judgment. Some of my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
Friends have argued one way and my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden produced a different argument. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was perhaps not comparing like with like in his comparison between films in the cinema and on television, because films in the cinema are new and those on television are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to point out briefly that, first, the figures mentioned by the hon. Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith)—for example, £2 million for Chariots of Fire—are exceptional, and do not represent the average amount that is paid for feature films by television companies. Secondly, the low figures paid are not paid only for old films but also for newer films.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of opinion and no doubt many film producers hold that opinion. However, whether it is accurate and justified is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no doubt that the demand for films is voracious and increasing, and supply is falling a long way short of demand. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden said, that situation is likely to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BBC and ITV do not often negotiate with pigmies. The rights to films are usually, owned by the major distributors who are well able to argue their corner, and sometimes by independent producers who are also sufficiently established to have the rights retained and are therefore unlikely to be easily overpowered by BBC or ITV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make too much of the point but it must be looked at against the background of the development of cable and DBS and the increasing appetite and demand for films. The question is whether people will be able to produce enough. Just the development of the market will, I think, drive prices up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make those points because although I understand the concern about the duopoly I think that the argument has been somewhat overstated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the question is not whether we can produce enough but whether we can produce enough in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that. We also have the advantage that our language gives access to a very large market. My hon. Friend is right. These changes will greatly expand our market and also provide opportunities throughout the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) has proposed amendement No. 43. The part about the tribunal on prices was perhaps designed to initiate a discussion about it. I am not sure how serious my hon. Friend is about setting up that body. I do not need to weary the Committee by going into all the arguments that one would normally have against such a body and the difficulty. We have had different views expressed in Committee about the prices paid. What is the right price? There are no willing buyers or willing sellers according to some of the remarks made. How on earth is the Committee to make these great adjudications? I think that my hon. Friend was trying to call forth a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
It has also been suggested that a levy should be made on the BBC by an increase of, say, 50p on the licence fee, with the intention that the money so raised be used to benefit the British film industry. The details of how such money would be distributed are not necessarily clear but the general idea seems to be for a 50p increase in the licence fees to be channelled exclusively towards the film industry. Superficially, this is perhaps a seductive proposal. A new pot of £9 million, generated at a cost to the television household of 50p, may seem attractive. But the argument is based on looking at the film industry in isolation, without taking account of the much wider purpose and scope of television, and the much wider interests of viewers. If there is to be 50p extra for films, why should there not be an extra 50p each for drama, music, cookery, sport or a whole host of subjects? If the market can bear an extra 50p, why should it be directed exclusively towards films?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I am informed that the proportion of ITV and Channel 4 screen time taken by feature films is 8 per cent. and 11 per cent. respectively, if one excludes the minor feature films that would not necessarily be suitable for cinema showing. However I believe that there has been some argument about the figures, and, of course, as has been remarked in our debates, unfortunately the audience ratings for feature films on television are decreasing. To quote Michael Grade of the BBC:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reliance on feature films has to decline as they are no longer delivering the audiences. One reason for this is that new films made for cinema which one might expect to be shown on television and to attract large audiences are in many cases not suitable for television."</p></blockquote>
I am not convinced that consumers would be content either to accept a surcharge on the licence fee or, indeed, to accept that films alone should benefit from such a surcharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next suggestion, which was perhaps argued more strongly, was there should be a levy on the BBC but without an increase in the licence fee. Of course, if a levy were imposed on the BBC without an increase in the licence fee one would need to consider how the BBC itself would meet the cost. In the past five years, the BBC's expenditure on feature films has risen by 100 per cent. in cash terms after discounting the effect of the 40 per cent. fall in the value of sterling against the dollar and, as everyone is aware, most of the industry's dealings are done in dollars. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) is a member of the Select Committee before which Mr. Ian Trethowan and Mr. Cotton explained how very much cheaper was the United States material. It costs about $15,000 an hour compared with £70,000 an hour for the cheapest British drama.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the likeliest consequences of the proposal would be that the BBC must meet the cost of the levy within its current budget, thus causing a cut-back in the amount of British material that is used in favour of the cheaper United States material. Therefore, those who benefited from the levy might be British film producers, but they might do so at the expense of British television drama producers, British actors

and British actresses. Indeed, the levy might accelerate the trend towards showing fewer feature films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to the fact that feature films are declining. They take only 8 per cent. of the screen time of ITV and BBC. If there is to be a levy without an increase in licence fee, that share could be reduced further as material not subject to levy took the place of films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that part of the special tax on television companies should be used for the film industry by a proportion of the money received by the Exchequer from taxing the television companies' profits being remitted to the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the proposition was that the Treasury should take a television levy because the companies make so much profit. It is not suggested that those profits should be taken as such, but that if the companies paid a sensible and reasonable price for the films, perhaps they would not make quite so much profit for the Treasury to take away. It is not a question of recycling Treasury helpings, but of making the companies pay a sensible, reasonable and fair price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made my comments on the price paid for films by television companies. The proposition is arguable. How one sees it depends on which side of the fence one is on. However, I see the connection so ingeniously made by my hon. Friend in that intervention. It has been argued that taxes from the companies should be used for the benefit of the film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Minister may have misunderstood a passage in the speech that I made on that point. Certainly, his recent remarks suggest that he has done. In response to the hon. Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith), I made it clear that what the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said was exactly what I was proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered my hon. Friend. I have given my comments on the question of prices. I need not weary the Committee by replying to an argument that was not made. However, I recollect that the argument was made. For what it is worth, I shall merely say that the tax is not a hypothecated tax, the uses of that tax are many, and, clearly, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not find the suggestion the most acceptable in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not dwell on the issue for long, as the hon. Member for Dagenham seems to think that the suggestion was never made. However, it was suggested that the independent television companies and the BBC were not putting enough money into films and the cinema. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North for confirming that on that point at least my recollection was right. He expressed anxiety about the expenditure of the companies on films and, I think, made the point that that expenditure was very small compared with the total budget. Therefore, it was argued that it was unfair because of the large proportion of screen time that is taken by films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
It is not always easy to find accurate statistics for the industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham said that 25 per cent. of companies' screen time was devoted to films. Those films include mini features which would not be attractive for cinema screening. We have to consider the proportion taken by feature films. My figures give I I per cent. for Channel 4, 8 per cent. for Channel 3 and 8 per cent. for the BBC, and they are falling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can clarify what I said by reminding the Committee of the letter written by Mr. David Shaw of the Independent Television Companies Association. Mr. Shaw stated that most films and film series bought by ITV are purchased by a central buying organisation which has to compete in the market place with the BBC, and that over the last four years, annual expenditure on feature films, movies and series, including material purchased by ITV companies on an individual basis for local use, was approximately £28 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has moved away from the proportion of time, to the question of money. I was talking about the time taken up on the screen by films, and said that it was a small proportion. As my hon. Friend said, the time has to be considered in relation to expenditure on films. Examination of the expenditure on film on Channel 4 and its purchase of complete British feature films show a total of £15.4 million on those films, despite the fact that audiences are falling. Furthermore, that sum does not include a number of feature films on other projects in the feature films sector, all of which are reflected in the figure of 11 per cent. for screen time for films on Channel 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the more general question of whether independent television companies have a responsibility for the industry, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale). He said this morning and at our previous sitting that the companies have a vested interest, and a responsibility for the film industry. Of course they do, and they recognise that, but that is no argument against leaving these matters to usual commercial negotiations. They provide a market for the film industry's products and they pay for what they use. They stimulate the development of new films and film services and, although little has been said about it in Committee, they also provide opportunities for advertising films, which now total approximately 3,000 a year. That is not insignificant in terms of the use of studios and technicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North raised the question of an audience-related television levy. I have had difficulties with the principles of the amendments, so I am sure that my hon. Friend will not wish me to go into too much detail about it, having mentioned its difficulties earlier. The idea raises a number of problems, even if I were attracted to it in principle. A small number of films have been acquired to achieve good audience figures. The Bond films and similar blockbusters would have drawn audiences of 20 million or so one year ago. Now they are way down, in many instances barely achieving half of what "Coronation Street" regularly attracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
Each blockbuster that is bought has a very mixed package of films travelling with it. The problem for the programme schedulers is how to find somewhere appropriate for them in the schedules rather than use them as individual titles aiming at maximum audiences. As I keep saying, television screen time is declining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other problems with this idea. Audience numbers must have a different implied value at different times of the day. There is no reason why something that is shown in the afternoon should be given the same value per audience number as something shown at peak time, whether it is a film or anything else. There may also be scheduling reasons why a film should be placed in a particular time slot, to provide a follow-on audience for subsequent programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those are details and I have said that I do not believe that the principle is right. Therefore, although my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North spelt out the matter with great knowledge and expertise, I do not think that it can be a substitute for a direct market relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large part of the debate dealt with pre-recorded tapes. Rental and sale of pre-recorded cassettes make up a market that has shown rapid growth, and the total market in the United Kingdom is likely to be worth about £300 million this year. Piracy, which featured in some hon. Members' speeches, has declined from being about 75 per cent. of retail transactions, and is now, thanks to recent measures, coming under control. There are still pirate products on the market which originated elsewhere but the percentage is now down to 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the total and falling. Rental now dominates the market, comprising 98 per cent. of all transactions and 80 per cent. to 85 per cent. of turnover. There are now no artificialities in the market, which is diverse and private.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that the industry realises that there is a shortage of product, and it is working hard to remedy that and is investing in films. I do not have figures, but it is well known that the industry is investing in films which will be of value to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard much about duopoly, rigged markets and so on, but this is certainly a strong and free segment of the market. The idea was proposed that it should somehow be levied and the money passed back into film production. Again I am not persuaded by that idea in principle and all sorts of problems would arise in trying to carry it out. Levying a charge at the retail end would mean identifying at least 150 million individual transactions and collecting a small percentage of each. I believe that my hon. Friends would probably suggest that it should not be done in that way but through distributors, but there are problems about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that a strong argument for abolishing income tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, and I believe that there is as an argument for self assessment as there is for abolition of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pre-recorded video is a highly competitive market and margins are wafer thin and already under threat from the failure of numerous outlets, shortage of
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
product and so on. Even a levy as low as I Op could have a substantial effect on sales and be entirely self-defeating. Not only could VAT yield decline and the levy fall well short of expectations but video distributors' investment in film production could be cut back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about blank tape which interested many members of the Committee. The number of video machines in this country has risen dramatically. There are now about 7.5 million, in 40 per cent. of television households—unfortunately not yet including mine, but I hope that will soon be remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conventional wisdom used to be that 70 per cent. of video machine use was for time shifting, and a substantial percentage of that was for the recording of films which were played back repeatedly. Indeed, that has been the basis of some of the arguments advanced in the Committee. However, recent studies have shown that time shifting happens less than previously thought and that the pattern of use, particularly of time-shifted material, does not confirm earlier impressions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend tell us by whom those studies were made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so shortly, but to give the answer now would mean delving into my papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help my hon. Friend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I should allow that!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were made by the industry—an interested party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now see that the studies were made by Audits of Great Britain for the Broadcast Audience Research Board, whose acronym is BARB. According to its research, the average video/ television household records about five hours of material a week for time-shift purposes. Of that, only four hours a week is ever used; the remaining hour seems not to be used. Of those four hours, only about 36 minutes on average is played back more than once. Leaving aside technical questions of copyright, surely that is not unreasonable; it is what people pay their licence fee for. Therefore the only segment of time-shifted material that the film industry could really complain about is 36 minutes, a mere 1.5 per cent. of an average week's television viewing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to a copyright levy. It appears that the use of blank tape is largely separated from repeated viewing of films taped from television. I do not see any ground for saying that there is substantial damage to the producer. Therefore, I do not believe that there is justification for a levy. As to the mechanism that might be employed, there could be problems about that. Clearly, the intention is to identify and levy a specific class of transaction—the sale of blank cassettes to be used for time shift. That could mean levying a very large number of transactions, which would be difficult; direct imports by large retailers and manufacturers' supplies for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
making pre-recorded tapes would be a complication. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) observed earlier, there would also be problems in relation to educational establishments. All those matters need to be carefully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are very real difficulties, but when it is realised how remote is the use of blank tape from an economic loss to producers, I am not persuaded that there is a justification for a redistributive levy of the sort proposed. At present, the price of tapes is heavily discounted and, when recent currency movements are taken into account, there is little profit for manufacturers selling into the United Kingdom market. Any levy would undoubtedly be passed straight on to the consumer, and it is inevitable in current market circumstances that an increase in price would depress demand. It is quite possible that it would bring about a loss in VAT, outweighing perhaps even the receipts from a levy. So I am not persuaded by the merits of that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given my point of view on—if not answered—the arguments and philosophy that have been deployed for the different types of levy. However, as I have not gone through all the details of the amendment and new clauses, I shall say a word about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 proposes that the levy would be retained until the Secretary of State can guarantee £10 million a year by means of levy. That is to be done by a levy on the independent television companies or on pre-recorded or blank video cassettes. It is not clear why those areas were singled out as potential levy targets, although I realise that the hon. Member for Dagenham said that it was just a way of introducing the debate, and that he did not want to be tied to the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 seeks to change the procedure for designating an appointed day or for repealing the Film Levy Finance Act 1981 from the current position, whereby no parliamentary procedure is required to the affirmative resolution procedure. It is a side issue, but I should like to say just a word about it. It is a rather superfluous suggestion because, as we are witnessing, there will have been full debate and discussion on the matter during the passage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 covers much the same ground as does new clause 2, although the amendment would recompense foreign film producers in total, far more than British film producers. Moreover, of the large number of films shown on television each year, a significant proportion will not be recent films. I see no point in making extra payments to producers of Harold Lloyd films. That may be a technicality, and perhaps hon. Members were simply wishing to initiate a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee by going through the other amendments. I have mentioned the main amendments. Despite the persuasive advocacy of my hon. Friends, and the powerful speeches that have been made, I recommend my hon. Friends to vote against the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, the Committee will wish to reach a conclusion on this group of amendments, so
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
I shall be brief as I can. I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his full reply, but in my view it is neither adequate nor convincing. We can all make statistics prove anything, and we may have been as guilty in our arguments as I believe the Minister has been. Had we wished to challenge the facts on which he based his arguments, he probably would not have finished his speech by this evening, because there are different interpretations, additional facts to supplement his omissions, and so on. The Minister argued his case clearly, but on insubstantial grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I point out in passing to my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) that it is not a bad thing to look back to the past. One can say that it is nostalgia, but I should have thought that, as a good Conservative, he would agree with me that we look back to the past not because of nostalgia but because it is basic Conservative wisdom to learn from the experience of the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was precisely my point. When my hon. Friend quoted something that I said in another context in 1964, 1 said that I had moved forward since then. Clearly, my hon. Friend has not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite what my hon. Friend says, let me quote from the past again—this time for his edification. The author of the remarks that I wish to quote was a former Minister with responsibility for films. Let my hon. Friend take courage from the fact that that Minister went on to become Prime Minister. We hope that perhaps that will also be my hon. Friend's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When that former Minister was selling out the Government shareholding in British Lion and throwing it to the wolves of private enterprise, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it is for the good of the industry that it should stand on its own feet. Great changes are taking place today. The full impact of television—possibly, of pay-television on film making has yet to be felt."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that had he known of it then, he might have included television, satellites and video casettes. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The making of films for cinemas will continue to enjoy very substantial support by means of the Eady levy, which increases British producers' commercial returns in the home market by about 60 per cent., by the screen quota, and by finance from the N.F.F.C. This is the contribution which the Government make.". [
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1964; Vol.688, c.1073–1074.]</p></blockquote>
Moreover, that contribution was being made when American finance was liberally available for British film making. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden would say, much has changed, but the need for support for the film industry has not. If we are to throw the industry into the wilderness of a free market, it also deserves a measure of additional support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr.Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentlemen agree that the purpose behind his amendment, which I wholeheartedly support, is to create the funding basis upon which private capital can be attracted to supplement the money available so as to create a pool from which British films can be financed?

million with annual additions in time, an ocean, as it were, will be created that will give the industry the strength that it needs to compete with other film makers in other parts of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemen is right. When my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) made those remarks, he was seeking, in the context of the film industry then, precisely what my hon. Friends and Opposition Members are seeking to do today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister has conceded that a British film industry is important. He made that concession in Committee. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would have hoped that that could have been taken forgranted.".[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 29 November 1984; c.21.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister and all the rest of us are on all fours in that respect. However, if one wills the ends, one must provide the means. I believe that the underlying problem facing us in Committee today is that the Minister's hands are tied not by the advice that he is receiving from his officials, but perhaps by the Home Office and the Treasury, both of which have a vested interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Secretary of State who wants a thriving film industry would be deceiving himself if he thought that the suggestions contained in the Bill are adequate. A Secretary of State who turns a blind eye to the fact that the real world in which British film making is being asked to prosper is dominated and distorted by monopoly purchasers, is living in a make-believe world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must face the facts and not shelter behind illusory hopes. For instance, capital allowances favoured the financing of British films, but they distorted the operation of a free market. Therefore, the Government decided that that distortion, because of its political and policy implications, should be removed. The Government have deemed that capital allowances must go, and they have gone. I hope that it will be appreciated that that distortion favoured British film making. Moreover, now that the distortion has been removed there is a penalty on British film making, because the industry does not have those advantages. My hon. Friend the Minister has merely left a situation in which other distortions remain and about which we have argued. We therefore seek a form of balance to rectify the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister contented himself with making arrangements which might finance one modest film a year, but just as one swallow does not make a summer so no funds do not make a summer for the British film making industry. My hon. Friend earlier referred to the number of Oscars awarded and successful blockbusters, but neither do two British Oscar awards make an Indian summer, and I hope that, even now, he will address himself to making meaningful and not window-dressing arrangements. I do not believe that pious forecasts are forecasts with which people living in the real world of the film industry have any sympathy. I hope that the Government will not be unduly intransigent about this matter and that my hon. Friends will support amendment No. 39. I hope that my hon. Friend will
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
seek the support of his colleagues in the Home Office and Treasury for the arguments which we had adduced in Committee, and that he can come back on Report to improve rather than negate what I hope we shall have added to the bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of the previous debate, the Minister—I think, with your indulgence, Mr. Crowther—strayed into the question of what would be done with the resources if we were to provide for a redistributive mechanism, which might now be possible as a result of the vote on the previous amendment. I hope that the Minister will look at the further stages of the Bill in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now move to a question raised briefly during the last debate, because we believe that the mechanisms provided by the Bill for funding the British film industry are inadequate. The Government proposes to do away with the NFFC on conditions that give us no confidence that the body proposed to take its place will adequately undertake such important responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the opportunity, as we look towards the unfortunate demise of the NFFC, to renew the tributes paid on Second Reading to its work. It has laboured long and hard with inadequate resources, but it is almost universally regarded as having done an admirable job with those limited resources. Many British films would not have seen the light of day had it not been for the excellent work of the NFFC and its director, Mamoun Hassan. The NFFC filled a gap in the spectrum of film finance and perhaps we have not paid enough attention to that aspect of film finance so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State quite
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
fairly made the point on Second Reading that film producers were now eligible for finance under the business expansion scheme. It is true that those who want to make small films on a limited budget, either with the aid of the business expansion scheme or in some other way, might well find that their problems in raising finance are not insurmountable. The Minister has constantly made reference to the Goldcrest investment programme and so on, but that is at the other end of the scale. It is there for what one hopes will be the immensely successful large-scale commercial film that would not get off the ground without large injections of private money, mainly from America and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFFC always took a particular responsibility for financing the middle budget film that would cost £1 million or more, when it was not clear that small sums of finance would be adequate to get the project off the ground or that such a project would be guaranteed the commercial success which would attract a major investor. It is in that area that the NFFC did its most valuable work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made by the hon. Member for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) to the celebrated director David Puttnam. I believe that his name is in danger of being used as a talisman on either side of almost any argument developed in Committee sometimes like a banner being displayed by opposing forces as they charge into battle. However, I think that David Puttnum is on record as saying he would reaffirm it to the Committee if he were here—that he owes a debt of gratitude to the NFFC. His first four or five films, which launched him into his career, would not have succeeded without the aid given by the NFFC. That also applies to other famous directors. Richard Attenborough would make a similar claim and acknowledge a similar debt. Therefore, we should record our sadness at the passing of the NFFC and our concern about the circumstances and conditions provided for its successor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are clearly addressed to a very narrow point. Clause 3(2) provides for any property which, as the result of the dissolution of the NFFC, should become vested in the Secretary of State and be disposed of by him in such a way as to benefit the British film industry for any purpose connected with that industry. The provision is essentially a permissive one. There is no obligation on the Secretary of State to use what in a sense comes to him as a Godsend or windfall for the benefit of the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to establish what the alternatives are and what else might happen to the money. Might it, as provided in the 1981 Act, simply pass into the Consolidated Fund? The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State is to reply to the debate and perhaps he will tell the Committee whether, notwithstanding clause 3(2), the money—I shall speak about the sums involved shortly, but they are not insubstantial—might get swallowed up into the great maw of Government expenditure and never see the light of day in terms of film expenditure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We are living through an episode during which the Government are gobbling up more than £3 billion of public assets for the sake of financing their current expenditure. Therefore, we must not be too sanguine about their attitude towards the few million pounds that might have been vested in the NFFC. It is true that, as with other privatisation measures, that money is not really the Government's to dispose spose of It has been provided largely through the Eady levy—that is, by the film industry—and the NFFC was entitled to it precisely because it was under a statutory obligation to spend it for the benefit of the British film industry. For reasons of equity and politics, we need to know what the Government intend to do with the money.

I wish to say something about the sums of money involved. Perhaps the Minister will clarify his estimate of the value of the assets. He stated initially that they might produce in the region of £200,000 in annual income. However, on Second Reading I believe—perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—he suggested that a larger parcel of assets was involved that would produce a larger amount of income and suggested that this might approach £600,000 a year. I shall be grateful if the Minister, when replying to the debate, will let us know the best estimate of the investment value of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, it might also be opportune to press the Minister who is leading the Government's opposition on this point about his comment—he has made it several times—that, by virtue of the various arrangements made, the successor to the NFFC will have more than double the amount of money available to the NFCC. My impression is that the Minister may be calculating the f600,000 of income when looking at the sources of revenue available to the succeeding body, but overlooking them when looking at the current income available to the NFFC. Will the Minister confirm that that £600,000—if that is the sum—must surely be available at present to the NFFC? If the sum is to be doubled his calculation seems not to be as accurate as it might be.

I have outlined the nature of the anxieties underlying the amendment. It is clearly designed to remove that discretion and therefore the possibility that this money might end up in some indeterminate way for general Government purposes. The purpose is to ensure that what is essentially film industry money should be spent on the film industry. We come later to the mechanisms that might be used to decide how the money should be spent and the channels through which it should pass. However, it is important to establish at this stage that it is film industry money and that the first claim on it is that of the industry itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
