	<div class='member'>The Minister for Lifelong Learning (Jacqui Smith)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education (School Government) (Terms of Reference) (England) Regulations 2000.</p></blockquote>
May I say what a pleasure it is for the first time to introduce a debate in Committee with you in the Chair, Mr. Sayeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations were laid before the House on 22 June and were considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on Tuesday 27 June. They meet important undertakings that we made under section 38 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Section 38 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations setting out the terms of reference for governing bodies of maintained schools and to define the respective role and responsibilities of governing bodies and head teachers, whether generally or in relation to the curriculum. The Act also allows the Secretary of State to confer specific functions on governing bodies and head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governers form the largest volunteer force in the country and there are now 360,000 of them. Their work is important and increasingly demanding. The School Standards and Framework Act placed on governors an over-arching responsibility to promote high standards of achievement in school. We need to ensure that governing bodies can fulfil that important and central role. Our main objective in making the regulations is to improve the way in which governing bodies do business. The Select Committee on Education and Employment, in its report last year on the role of school governors, drew attention to the need for governing bodies to have a clearer understanding of their role and welcomed the Government's intention to provide a clear statement of the respective roles that we expect governing bodies and head teachers to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been worried that some governing bodies could become too involved in detailed management issues, which should properly be for the head teacher. Not only would that result in governing bodies becoming overloaded, it could risk their getting into unnecessary disputes with their head teachers. More importantly, it could divert governing bodies from focusing on their most important task, which is to help raise standards of achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In "Better Regulation Task Force Review of Red Tape Affecting Head Teachers", Lord Haskins identified the need to provide governing bodies with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
more clear definition of their role, to allow governors to focus more on what needs to be achieved rather than on the school's day-to-day running. Both that and the Select Committee report identified the need to define roles and responsibilities more clearly to make it easier for governors to concentrate less on detailed operational matters and more on key strategic issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations enshrine key roles for governing bodies that are widely accepted, such as setting the school's strategic direction and acting as "a critical friend". They increase the accountability of governing bodies by requiring them to explain their decisions and actions. The terms of reference set out—as operating principles for governing bodies—the Nolan principles of honesty, objectivity and integrity in public life. They require governing bodies to be open about their decisions and actions, other than, obviously, those that should properly be kept confidential for legal reasons or because they affect individuals. Governing bodies should be accountable for their decisions and be prepared to explain their decisions and actions to those with a legitimate interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also clarify the roles and responsibilities of governing bodies vis-à-vis head teachers. Sorting out the boundaries is crucial to getting that all-important relationship between the head and the governing body right. We want to use the regulations to secure a clearer consensus on the distinction between governance and management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important not to impose a straitjacket that will not allow account to be taken of the size or type of school or the personalities and strengths of individuals. Governing bodies and head teachers need some flexibility to enable them to operate on the basis that suits them best. However, how they agree to operate should be part of a nationally agreed framework, to protect both parties from unreasonable encroachment into each other's legitimate spheres of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guidance on the regulations, especially on the use of delegation, will help governing bodies organise their work load more effectively as well as minimise the scope for debilitating disputes. I am pleased to inform hon. Members that copies of the guidance supporting the regulations have now been placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In defining the role of governing bodies, we have emphasised that they should fulfil a largely strategic role in running the school. We recognise that governing bodies have some statutory duties placed on them that are not strategic, but as far as possible governing bodies should act strategically, setting objectives and targets, formulating policies, and monitoring and evaluating progress. They should consider the head teacher's professional advice and act as "a critical friend", supporting him and offering constructive criticism and advice. We expect governing bodies to ask searching questions rather than merely rubber-stamp proposals presented to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also clarify elements of the head's role and responsibilities in the context of the governing body's responsibilities. In drafting the regulations, we have taken particular care to build on relevant aspects of the head teacher's role as defined in the conditions of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
employment of head teachers published in the schoolteachers' pay and conditions document. They clarify that the head is responsible for the internal organisation, management and control of the school and the implementation of the strategic framework established by the governing body. Although the head is responsible for formulating objectives and policies and setting targets, on all those issues the final decision rests with the corporate governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In delegating functions for which governing bodies are responsible, the regulations require the governing body to consider its largely strategic role, as well as the head teacher's responsibility for the school's internal organisation, management and control. The head teacher is required to comply with any reasonable direction from the governing body that relates to any function that it delegates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations allocate responsibilities to governing bodies and head teachers for agreeing and implementing the school's curriculum policy and the performance management policy. The requirement for a school curriculum policy merely formalises what is already happening in schools. Although the performance management policy is new, agreeing it should not be onerous, as the Department has produced a national model performance management policy. The governing body can ask the head teacher to formulate the policy, which must be established by 31 December this year. It should review the policy once a year. It should ensure that all teachers at the school are consulted, but it can ask the head teacher to undertake those consultations on its behalf. The performance management policy will underpin the Education (School Teacher Appraisal) (England) Regulations 2000 laid on 20 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During consultation on the regulations, a strong consensus was expressed that the regulations are timely. In clarifying this grey area of governance and management, we hope that governing bodies and head teachers will have a clearer appreciation of each other's roles and responsibilities. The majority of governing bodies and heads work well together. We want all governing bodies and head teachers to work effectively together for the good of the school. I therefore commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.39 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Sayeed—in my case, as in the Minister's, for the first time—to consider these regulations on school government. I pay tribute to the extremely valuable, public-spirited work of thousands of school governors throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 38 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, the parent Act of the regulations, refers to the governing body of a school promoting high standards of educational achievement. We share that aim and recognise the contribution that governors make to its fulfilment. However, we invite the Committee to pause and consider how much additional work the regulations will involve. They will create work not only for governors, but for head teachers, who are not exactly short of additional work at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
As I calculate it, governing bodies are required to undertake at least 14 separate procedural steps under the provisions of section 4 of the Act and under the regulations. Much of the legislation will clearly generate further paperwork, which might be detailed and lengthy. Head teachers are required to take seven procedural steps under the regulations and if, as seems likely, the head is directed by the governing body to formulate a performance management policy, he or she will have to undertake a further four procedural steps. That formulation can clearly not be made in an instant. It might—and probably will—require the head to consult the school's entire teaching staff. To draw up a policy encompassing everything involved in the performance of a school will take time. We give pause to consider that aspect of the regulations. In the present circumstances, it is important to pause on any regulations before the House that impose extra burdens on head teachers. Has the Minister estimated the time that it will take heads to fulfil each procedural requirement in the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 5(2)(a) is about the formulation of
	<br><blockquote><p>aims and objectives for the school.</p></blockquote>
Regulation 5(2)(b) is about the formulation of
	<br><blockquote><p>policies … for achieving those aims and objectives,</p></blockquote>
while regulation (5)(2)(c) concerns the formulation of
	<br><blockquote><p>targets for the achievement of those aims and objectives.</p></blockquote>
In each case, we should bear in mind that the head is required to obtain the approval of the governing body, which may modify or reject what he proposes. Does the Minister have any idea of the targets that heads must set and formulate under regulation 5(2)(c)? How many targets will there be? How will they differ from the many other targets that schools have already been set?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister observed, guidance has been placed in the Library about the regulations. It suggests that 64 decisions are required to be made by or are delegated to the head, or are to be made by the governing body with advice from the head. It also suggests 32 separate responsibilities for heads in schools with delegated budgets. As a result of that extra work in the regulations, will head teachers expect to receive any more documents in the post entailing more hours of additional work for them? A head in my constituency told me that he had come to dread the prospect of receiving more such documents every morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister dispute the estimate that heads of secondary schools were sent 46 separate documents up to the middle of May this year? Some contained guidance and some information, but heads were required to read them all. Will she confirm the fact that, since May 1997, each school has received at least 366 separate pieces of paperwork directly from the Department, not to mention many of the documents sent by her Department to local education authorities that are sent on to schools?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is small wonder that there are more and more reports of head teachers coming to the end of their tether with the red tape emanating from the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Department. The Minister may have seen the report in last week's edition of 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> under the banner headline "Red tape boycott looms for heads". In that report, Mr. Mick Brooks, president of the National Association of Head Teachers and a Nottinghamshire primary head, is quoted as saying
	<br><blockquote><p>One head said to me, why don't we just return stuff to the DFEE unopened, marked "return to sender"? I can see some heads coming to the end of their tether.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will understand why I have set out those points. We need to consider how much additional work the regulations create. The Minister herself mentioned the Government's better regulation task force and quoted comments from it. We might do well to bear in mind the conclusion of that task force:
	<br><blockquote><p>There is a widespread and deeply held view that increased red tape is acting as a distraction from the drive to raise standards … Over-elaborate processes are being used to achieve straightforward objectives, leading to unnecessary duplication and confusing excessive lines of accountability.</p></blockquote>
In the light of that analysis, we should scrutinise these measures particularly carefully and ask just how much extra work is created. The Government need to give pause and reflect on the situation of the teaching profession, particularly head teachers. Such regulations may seem important in the Minister's scheme of things, but they can consume the time and energy of head teachers and take them away from the day-to-day task of providing leadership, which is so important in running a good school and giving our children a good education. Although we enter that forceful reservation about the regulations, we will not press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the regulations and their aim of clarifying the role of head teachers and governing bodies. They have received strong support from the National Governors Council, from local school governors in my constituency and from the Dudley Association of Governing Bodies, which represents all the school governors in the borough of Dudley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two brief points. The first is on the increasing work load of school governors and head teachers. That point emerges clearly from the better regulation task force report on red tape affecting head teachers and I am pleased that the report takes some account of it. We must recognise that school governors, for whose dedication I have nothing but respect, provide a vital resource for the local community. However, when they talk to me it is clear that they are extremely concerned about their work load and the levels of red tape in the system. No one wants to see school governors bogged down in the detail of running schools; that is why the regulations are important and should be approved. We need to make sure that the excellent partnerships in many of our schools between the head teacher, the governing body, staff and parents are allowed to flourish, but we should be clear that we do not want school governors buried under a mountain of paperwork. The guidance contains no fewer than 41
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
footnotes—which are not in the plainest English. Will the Minister tell us whether there is an intention to produce a simplified, easy-to-use version?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is on training. School governors undertake a variety of training courses to enable them to fulfil their role, but some are of distinctly poor quality. Are the Government making moves to provide training quality assurance and are there plans to introduce on-line training? In the digital age, it is easier for governors, who have access to the internet through schools—in my constituency they are all wired up—to log on and receive their training on-line. If the Government could do something in that respect, we might find ways of ensuring that our school governors receive the training that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the provisions in the statutory instrument and hope that it will not be opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Sayeed. I have had the pleasure of serving under you before, and I know you to be an extremely fair and just person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) seems to be able to create the direst situation from anything, and I sometimes wonder what it would be like to live with him. On second thoughts, I am sure that that is an absolute slur, because he is a great chap, as is the Opposition Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is even better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the hon. Gentleman; I know the hon. Member for Hertsmere well because we have spent a lot of time in Committee together. However, it is beyond my belief that any Conservative Front-Bench spokesman can come along to any Standing Committee and talk about overburdensome bureaucracy and regulation. I say that particularly after the excuse for a policy statement yesterday, in which it was said that 25,000 schools would be given their own—I am sorry, Mr. Sayeed. I digress in the excitement of the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a pity that the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who has a tremendous love for state sector schools, was not available when the Select Committee made its school governors' inquiry. I served on the Select Committee and, like most such work, it was very rewarding. We met governors not only in the House when we launched the inquiry, but throughout Britain. I attended a large gathering in Leeds, in the north-west; all members of the Committee met governors as part of that inquiry. In every meeting that we attended, we were told that the roles of the head teacher, the management of the school and the governors needed to be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the present confusion arose because of previous legislation, to which the hon. Member for Hertsmere was party, which gave an enhanced role to governors in order to control head teachers and management and take powers away from local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
education authorities. Along with every governors' association, I welcome the clarification of head teacher and management roles, and of the non-executive director role of the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations and guidance go a long way towards that clarification. The hon. Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson) is right that there are too many footnotes to cross-reference, but in comparison with the Croner "School Governors Legal Guide", it is simplicity itself. Governors have to plough through a plethora of regulations to make sense of their role, and the document before us is fairly simple in comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What other regulations does the Minister intend to remove? Governors' regulations have heaped up since the Education Reform Act 1988. Will the Minister simplify them by putting them into one document? I am sure that such an assurance would address many of the comments made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. If everything stays, all we will achieve is the compounding of regulation on regulation. Most of us know that the legislation will become a back-room lawyer's charter—one regulation will be cross-referenced with another, and the question will be which piece of legislation has supremacy. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who was a brilliant lawyer before he entered the House—and probably still is—would agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have gone beyond the Select Committee report's recommendations in a number of areas, which they are right to do where they see fit. Performance management is the one area that will create enormous tension unless we get it right. Governors were concerned about their role in performance management. Would it just be a role for the head? Alternatively, would governors have a role in terms of the threshold, which, technically, they are not supposed to have? Will they have a role to play in the leadership scale and promotions? That is not clear in the regulations. If they do have such a role, it will be a completely new one vis-à-vis teaching staff and opportunities for promotion and enhancement. I hope that the Minister will define clearly, on the record, where the governor's role begins and ends on performance management issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know why the hon. Member for Hertsmere was surprised at the idea of asking a head to set out the aims and objectives of the school. Any self-respecting head—even a public school head—who did not do that would fail in his duty. That is an important issue for governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the idea of setting targets in the school. I am delighted that the Minister listened carefully to the policy announcement made last week by the Liberal Democrat leader, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy). He announced that we wish to scrap all national targets and make it a responsibility of every school to set clear aims and objectives for every child's improvement, because every child matters. If that is a precursor to the Minister announcing, after the comprehensive spending review, that all the other targets will go—including the ludicrous exclusion target, among others—it will be greatly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Under paragraph 4(3), what will be the Government's advice, if any, on monitoring? That could be a major area of confusion. Where will the standards agenda and the monitoring of aims and objectives set by the governing body begin and end? That could create a mountain of bureaucracy and impinge on what happens in the classroom. Would it involve governors going into the classroom or some form of inspection within the system? We found that some governors were doing such work. Some school departments were therefore being inspected not only by the Office for Standards in Education but by governors. It would be helpful if the Minister put on record that we do not expect them to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, South—whom I confused with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) because they look similar—made a genuine point about training. The Select Committee raised two issues in that regard, in relation to which the Government gave their support. One was to have a single advice line. I asked recently when it would be set up. The answer that I was given was that it would not be in the foreseeable future, although I am sure that the Minister will tell us today when it will be launched. Giving an assurance that the existing organisations will be supported is not good enough—a simple, straightforward one-stop advice shop is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the role of the clerk does not appear in the regulations. It was the clear view of the Select Committee that governing bodies need to receive good advice on which they can rely. If, however, the Minister is saying that the role of the clerk will be enhanced under the regulations, I apologise for having misunderstood her argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mistake in paragraph 2(1). It is not only the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 that needs to be included in the regulations; reference should be made to the Learning and Skills Bill, when it is enacted, because it will set up city academies. I presume that the Government expect city academies to be covered by the regulations. If the regulations went through unamended, academies would be the only group of schools left out. With those brief points, my party is happy to welcome the regulations in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the regulations and strongly endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) said about the training of governors. In my constituency, it has been my experience that people who take on willingly the responsibilities of governorship in their local schools are essentially happy about what the hon. Member for Hertsmere chose to describe as a burdensome commitment to their schools. They would very much welcome the much closer relationship with the schools and greater responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations offer great benefits with regard to links with the local community. It has been put to me on more than one occasion that governors would accept additional training. The idea of my hon. Friend the

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Member for Dudley, South about on-line training would be welcomed by many governors who already lead extremely busy lives. It would be a way for them to accommodate their responsibility, which is meeting demands that, in many instances—despite what the hon. Member for Hertsmere said—they lay on themselves to deliver to their schools, pupils and communities. I am sure that they would, in the main, welcome the regulations. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough also referred to growing responsibility and greater involvement with the staff of the school, which I know from conversations that governors would welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to burden my hon. Friend the Minister, the Department, governors or schools further, I wish to pass on to her some information. Recently, I addressed a women's conference of the Secondary Heads Association. It was an interesting meeting for me and I trust that its members found my contribution interesting, too. The participants were extremely capable women from all over the country who have been dedicated to education all their lives. I have no evidence of numbers to lay before my hon. Friend, but the concerted representation that was made to me from such a responsible body warrants more than merely anecdotal attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association sees it as a disturbing trend that, when a female secondary head or assistant head retires, there seems to be a growing move to replace her with a male head or assistant head. It is part of the Government's policy to prioritise women in positions of responsibility throughout government—for example, in the civil service. Indeed, numbers and time scales have been set. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will pass on the message to governors of schools that such action would be a step back for women of their undoubted achievements, given the struggle that all of them have had, certainly in the education sector, to take on the most responsible of jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about positive discrimination. It would be extremely hard for anyone to argue that a woman who achieves the post of head or assistant head of any school is anything other than excellent and clearly fitted for the job. However, it should be clear to all governors that some responsibilities are specific to their communities and schools. Equally, there must be a reflection of the wider requirements that both central and local government are being urged to take on and disseminate. Those requirements are connected with genuine equality. There can be no equality in schools if there is a step back from the undoubted achievements of women, following the struggle that they have undertaken happily for so many years.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Sayeed. I want to make my contribution extremely brief, but should deal with two points that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere did not cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I deprecate the comments made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about my hon. Friend. They demean him. The problem with the Liberal Democrats is that they can pontificate all they like, knowing that they will never have to put their theories into practice. I thought that my hon. Friend did his homework extremely well, and did the Committee a service. I echo his comments as an ex-school governor and thank every governor in the land for the voluntary service that they provide so generously. I hope that many more people come forward. We should ensure that their task is as easy as possible, and I hope that the regulations make it a little easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough in asking what other regulations will be withdrawn. Whenever we put something on the statute book, we ought to know what we are replacing. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Member for Dudley, South that we need to provide better training for our governors, and we should carefully consider whether it should be provided on-line, through seminars or through other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss the role of Ofsted. On scanning the notes that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere obtained from the Library, I was surprised that there was no mention of Ofsted. Perhaps I missed one. When Ofsted inspects schools, is it supposed to scrutinise how the guidance notes have been drawn up and comment on them? If so, Ofsted will have to do considerably more work than at the moment. When Ofsted has carried out its inspection and made its report, what will be the role of the head teacher and the governors in considering the report? I am sure that the Minister will say that it depends on what type of recommendations are made. However, that matter must be addressed, as the guidance contains nothing about it. If the Minister cannot give us answers today, she should consider—dare I say it?—an addendum to the guidance, preferably on one side of A4 to keep it simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An underperforming head teacher will cause problems for a governing body. Gross cases of underperformance are easy to deal with, as one can go through the statutory procedures and give someone notice to quit. Someone who is slightly underperforming is much more difficult to deal with. Will the Minister tell us how governors would deal with such a situation? Perhaps it would be through the performance management policy. Governors would surely want to deal with it, as it is likely that the whole school would underperform if the head underperformed, and no one would want that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. One of the problems that the heads repeatedly reported was the amount of regulation and paperwork that regularly arrived from the Department for Education and Employment. Therefore, I was surprised when the hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned extra regulations and more paperwork, because his Government started the trend. Are we going to remove some of the rules and regulations that apply to the heads and governing bodies? They are hugely burdened by a great deal of paperwork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Leeds, we had a problem finding the many governors needed to serve voluntarily. Those who do so have a great deal of enthusiasm and take pleasure in wanting to serve the school in the community in which they live. We must pay tribute to their hard work, notwithstanding what my hon, Friend the Member for Dudley, South said about training. That point was also made by my hon, Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson). We need to encourage more people to serve on governing bodies. I am sure that there is a nationwide problem of finding parent-governors and local education authority governors. I am concerned that we shall discourage governors from serving voluntarily unless we reduce the volume of detailed rules and regulations of their obligations. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give some comfort on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the pleasurable position of considering regulations that, far from putting extra burdens on schools' governing bodies and head teachers, will play an important role in clarifying and reducing the amount of work. I reassure hon. Members that the guidance and regulations relate mainly to existing obligations, perhaps with the exception of the strategic framework, curriculum policy and performance management policy. The aim of the regulations is to clarify responsibility to ensure that tasks are performed as efficiently as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertsmere raised a point about regulation 5. I pointed out that it mirrors heads' responsibilities under current documents on school teachers' pay and conditions. Therefore, the regulation crystallises work already being done, and does not impose new burdens. I accept comments made by my hon. Friends about the burden on governors and head teachers rather more easily than I accept those made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. That is especially true given that, presumably, head teachers are today concerning themselves with the possibility of organising school transport for their pupils. That was one of the schemes that the Leader of the Opposition came up with yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The point about the burden of work is however important. We are conscious of the demands on schools, particularly head teachers; that is why we are committed to less red tape and to allowing heads more freedom to focus on essentials. We are taking action to help reduce the burdens on head teachers, for example by considering reform of the standards fund, by reducing—as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently announced—automatic communications to schools by a third in number and a half in length and by giving schools practical help with performance management. We take that action seriously because, as I emphasised, the key role of governors and head teachers is to concentrate on raising standards in our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond specifically to the points made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough on performance management. Including performance management in the regulations builds on previous performance management regulations and makes sense in terms of clarifying the role and responsibilities of governors. However, under the new performance management arrangements, governing bodies will have two key roles. The first, to review head teachers' performance and pay, is not a new one. I accept that, as the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) said, reviewing head teachers' performance and challenging it where it is unsatisfactory are important responsibilities. However, under the new arrangements, governors would carry out that task with the help of an accredited external adviser—support that has not previously been available to governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the second role, governing bodies would need to agree a performance management policy for the school and ensure that it is operated effectively by monitoring at a strategic level. We are not saying that governing bodies should be responsible for drawing up the nitty-gritty of performance management policy, but they would be responsible for monitoring it. In terms of support and training for that—linking the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Dudley, South and for Hampstead and Highgate on performance management—in June we issued performance management guidance for governors. We have also developed a training pack on performance management that is specifically for governors. That training will be available from 26 June, when the training for heads begins. The training consists of three modules—to ensure flexibility and to help meet the varied training needs of governors. I accept that governors need that flexibility. Funding for training is available through the standards fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth while commenting on the questions posed by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about what we mean when we talk about governing bodies "monitoring" and "evaluating". Individual governors are not required to collect detailed information. Governing bodies should agree monitoring arrangements with head teachers, including the format in which performance information should be provided to check on progress. Using that information, they should evaluate how matters are progressing and the need for any changes. We do not expect—this is part of our intention to clarify roles and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
responsibilities under the regulations—governors to visit classrooms as inspectors with clipboards. Monitoring classrooms is the job not of governors, but of Ofsted. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate that constructive contact between governors and members of staff can be important in helping governors carry out their role. Organising a school so that governors are linked with particular members of staff, who keep the governors up to date on curriculum issues, can be a helpful way for governing bodies to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough mentioned the advice line. The Select Committee recommended not that the Government should take over the provision of a single form of support in the form of an advice line but that governor organisations should work together to provide a single source of advice. As I pointed out in my response to the question to which he alluded, it is important to allow governor organisations to iron out any difficulties that they may have in agreeing the format of that advice line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is not suggesting that the Government should charge in, remove support for governor organisations and impose something over the heads of those organisations. I give him the commitment that we shall continue to work with the three organisations that represent governors in order to reach a conclusion on providing a single advice line for governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate raised the important issue of equal opportunities. I shall certainly pass on her anxieties about the appointment of women as head teachers to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I agree that governing bodies need to be aware of their responsibilities in relation to equal opportunities, and we shall consider further how those responsibilities and that role should be fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also strongly agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Dudley, South and for Hampstead and Highgate about the importance of training. As we have made clear, we shall introduce a national strategy for support and training. Although I realise that LEAs do much good work in providing governor training and support, the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South made about the need to ensure that such provision is quality assured and subject to a national standard about which governors can be confident is important. We are currently working on that and on how to encourage voluntary accreditation for qualifications that reflect the significant contribution that governors make and the skills that they build up in undertaking their activities as governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) mentioned the important issue of recruitment, which we also take seriously. We have supported the setting up of school governor one-stop shops in excellence in city areas, which is already having a beneficial effect in helping LEAs recruit in some of the areas that, as he rightly says, present more difficulties. In answer to the question about the relationship of city academies to the regulations, city

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an important statement—the stark revelation that city academies will not be subject to the normal regulations. Last week, on Report and Third Reading of the Learning and Skills Bill, certain provisions for city academies were accepted, including compliance with LEA policies on admissions, exclusions and accepting excluded pupils. If the Minister is now saying that none of the regulations applies to such schools, that is a major change from what the Secretary of State led us to believe last week on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am glad that members of the Committee have had the chance to examine the guidance and I hope that they will have the opportunity to read the planner, which is aimed at clarifying the levels at which different decisions can most effectively and efficiently be taken. We have received a good response to it. I have some sympathy with the comments of members of the Committee about the 41 footnotes to the document. Although I did not spend my time pouring over education legislation before I became a Minister, some people like to have a cross-reference to such legislation, and that was the intention behind the footnotes. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South will agree that the preceding guidance is clear and readable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered quite a few of the specific points made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. We want the guidance to concentrate on the regulations in relation to the roles and responsibilities of head teachers and governing bodies. There will be other guidance and forms of advice about the position in respect of Ofsted. We have to decide whether we want the guidance to be a governing body's guide to all of its responsibilities or whether we want it to clarify the position. I do not believe that governing bodies are unclear about their responsibilities to

Ofsted. If the hon. Gentleman believes that they are and can put forward a case for that, I shall be willing to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations make a clear distinction between roles and responsibilities. Head teachers and governing bodies have their distinct roles to play, and I am sure that the regulations will make the lives of both parties easier by laying down the ground rules as well as making the roles more transparent and open. They have been well received during the consultation process. I wish finally to take the opportunity to say that we aim to achieve support for the excellent work of
