	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking new clause 10—
	<i>Community safety order (No. 1)</i>—

	<ol>

	<li>'—In the circumstances set out in this section a county court may make a community safety order.</li>

	<li>The applicant is the head of the paid service of a local authority.</li>

	<li>A county court may make a community safety order at any time on application if the conditions set out in this section are satisfied.</li>

	<li>Before making an application for a community safety order, the head of paid service of a local authority shall consult with a police officer responsible for the policing of the local authority area of the rank of superintendent or above and shall inform the court whether the police officer supports the application or not.</li>

	<li>A community safety order may contain such provisions as the court considers necessary to protect persons living in or visiting property owned or managed by a qualifying person from crime, harassment or intimidation or to protect property belonging to any person living in such property or property belonging to a qualifying person and may include:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>an order restricting the respondent from a specified area or several such areas either completely or at specified times;</li>

	<li>an order requiring the respondent to remain within the curtilage of a dwelling or other premises at specified times;</li>

	<li>an order requiring the respondent to enter a specified area or specified premises only when escorted by a specified person or with the written consent of a specified person;</li>

	<li>an order prohibiting the respondent from approaching a specified person or persons;</li>

	<li>an order requiring the respondent not to approach specified premises or enter within a specific area around such premises;</li>

	<li>an order prohibiting the respondent from contacting specified persons in any way or in specified ways;</li>

	<li>an order requiring the respondent not to cause any forms of nuisance or annoyance to specified persons.</li></ol>

	<li>(6) Where the previous subsection requires a person to be specified this may be done by naming that person or by a description of a class of persons.</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>

	<li>(7) Where the conditions of the community safety order are met in relation to any child or young person a community safety order may be made:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>where the child or young person is over the age of 10 years of age, against the child or young person; and</li>

	<li>in any case against the parent or guardian of that child.</li></ol>

	<li>(8) Where an order is made against a parent or guardian under the previous subsection it may—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>contain provisions relating to that child as set out in subsection (7); but</li>

	<li>require the parents or guardian to take specified steps to ensure that his child complies with the order rather than requiring the child to comply with the order.</li></ol>

	<li>(9) The conditions to be satisfied for the making of a community safety order are that the respondent or in the case of an application relating to a child, the child:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>has been guilty of not less than five unlawful acts within an area that in the opinion of the applicant forms a neighbourhood which have interfered with the peace or comfort of one or more residential occupiers in that neighbourhood or members of their households; or</li>

	<li>has on not less than five occasions been guilty of damaging property belonging to a qualifying person within an area that in the opinion of the applicant forms a neighbourhood;</li>

	<li>has been guilty on not less than five occasions of conduct which amounts to an offence under any provision of the Public Order Act 1984 (as amended) and these offences have been committed within a qualifying area.</li>

	<li>has been guilty on not less than five occasions of a combination of the matters described in subparagraphs (a) to (c).</li></ol>

	<li>In this section "residential occupier" in relation to any premises means a person occupying the premises as a residence where the premises belong to a qualifying person or are in the vicinity of premises belonging to a qualifying person.</li>

	<li>A qualifying area means an area that the local authority considers to be a neighbourhood and which includes dwellings belonging to a qualifying person (whether or not it also includes dwellings or other premises belonging to other persons).</li>

	<li>A qualifying person for the purposes of this section is:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>a local authority;</li>

	<li>a housing action trust;</li>

	<li>a registered social landlord;</li>

	<li>a housing association</li></ol>

	<li>An act is unlawful for the purposes of this section if it is a crime or a tort.</li>

	<li>A person is guilty of an act if he has committed that act whether or not he has been convicted of that act by a criminal court and proof of that act shall be required on the balance of probabilities.</li>

	<li>In deciding whether the conditions for a community safety order are met, a child may be guilty of the conduct referred to notwithstanding that he could not be convicted of a criminal offence.</li>

	<li>The following offences are conclusively to be assumed to have interfered with the peace or comfort of a residential occupier:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>a burglary committed in any dwelling occupied by the residential occupier or members of his household;</li>

	<li>theft from any such dwelling;</li>

	<li>any offence against the person of any residential occupier or any member of his household committed in that person's dwelling or in the vicinity of that dwelling.</li></ol>

	<li>For the purposes of this section "the vicinity of" a dwelling or premises shall include:

	<ol>

	<li>where the dwelling house or premises is part of a block of flats, any other part of the same block of flats; and</li>

	<li>where the dwelling house or premises is situated on an estate, any other part of the same estate;</li></ol>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
and whether or not a group of dwellings or other premises forms an "estate" or shall be decided without reference to the identity of the person or persons responsible for the management or control of any of those dwellings or premises.</li>

	<li>When deciding whether or not to make a community safety order the court shall consider all the circumstances of the case including:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>whether any person or property require the protection of a community safety order to prevent further crime, harassment, intimidation or nuisance;</li>

	<li>whether or not there are other powers available tot he courts which are reasonably capable of being exercised by which those persons or that property could be protected from such conduct by the respondent;</li>

	<li>the seriousness of the respondent's conduct;</li>

	<li>the extent to which persons living in or visiting the neighbourhood have been, or appear likely to have been affected by the respondent's conduct;</li>

	<li>any evidence that persons have been or may have been reluctant to report any unlawful conduct by the respondent or to appear as witnesses in any court proceedings against the respondent because of a fear of intimidation or harassment.</li></ol>

	<li>(19) A person breaching a community safety order commits an offence and shall be liable—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both;</li>

	<li>on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.</li></ol>

	<li>(20) the Lord Chancellor amy make such rules and give such directions as he sees fit for the purpose of:</li>

	<ol>

	<li>enabling an application for a community service order to be made to the magistrates and Crown Courts;</li>

	<li>enabling those courts to consider that application and decide whether to make an order;</li>

	<li>enabling an application for an order to be made to the county court;</li>

	<li>enabling the county court to consider the application and decide whether to make an order;</li>

	<li>enabling the application tot he county court to be made on an expedited basis and setting out the circumstances in which an expedited application can be made.'.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party is holding a major conference on housing today and my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) is starring in it. I thought that the Minister would be attending it, but I am delighted to see him in the Committee today so that I can raise with him an issue that has come to my attention. He wrote to me on 29 February 1996, but the letter began with the words "Dear Diana". I realise that Opposition Members are supposed to look alike but, for the record and for the Minister's correspondence Unit, I must say that there is a substantial difference between the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) and myself—apart from the fact that she is not in Committee at the moment. When the Minister writes to members of the Committee, it would be nice if he got their names correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have had a good debate about community safety orders and members of the Committee have had the opportunity to raise important points concerning evidence and to discuss the purpose behind community service orders. The problem of intimidation of witnesses remains unresolved, but our debate on clause stands part and new clause 10 has enabled us to raise important points that I hope that the Government will consider carefully. The 
	<i>Hansard</i> report our proceedings shows clearly that the matter of evidence must be dealt with. However, it might be more appropriate to return to that subject at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>that if the warrant for arrest of the respondent is not granted he will interfere with witness or otherwise obstruct the course of justice.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
Amendment No. 329 would tighten up the wording of clause 118(1) which, at present, is a little vague. It should be clear to the respondent what type of behaviour will make him liable to the arrested. When the respondent is brought before the court, the court and his legal advisers will have the task of ensuring that he understand the order that the court has made against him. If a power of arrest were made ex parte and served on the respondent, he will not be brought before the court and will probably not have the benefit of immediate legal advice. It is important that it can be made as clear as possible to the respondent when he will make himself liable for arrest under the power of arrest. It is also of the utmost importance that there should be no uncertainty surrounding the criteria that the constable applies when deciding whether to make the arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of amendment No. 330 is identical to section 2(5) of the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976, which concerns the arrest of a person for breach of an injunction. The amendment would increase the prospect of the respondent being dealt with for the breach at the first hearing of the matter—in other words, when he is brought the court for the time after his arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police are already under a duty to bring the respondent before the court within 24 hours; that is made clear in clause 118(2). The amendment would place an additional duty on the arresting constable to contact the court as soon as possible. That would enable court time to be allocated at the earliest opportunity, increasing the likelihood of the court being able to hear the case fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty to notify the local authority is, in our view, essential. The experience of practitioners in cases of domestic violence for which injunctions are granted is that many court hearings are ineffective because witnesses are not present to give evidence. That results in a further waste of court time, and a waste of taxpayer's money should the respondent be legally aided. The duty to notify the local authority is geared to increasing the likelihood of witnesses being in court if the respondent appears in court after being arrested. It is in the interests of the victim, the respondent, the court, the prison service and the local authority that remands to future dates are avoided whenever possible. The repondent's breach should be dealt with as soon as possible. If the case is not disposed of at the first hearing, the local authority may wish to make representations as to whether the respondent should be remanded in custody or on bail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 331 would add further conditions to subsection (4). The Bill gives the court the power to issue a warrant for the respondent's immediate arrest—a bench warrant, issued to those who apply to the bench in person. The respondent may then be held in custody for up to 24 hours. After that, he may be remanded in custody until his case is heard. The only precondition to the court's power to issue a bench warrant is that the injunction in respect of which the warrant is sought was granted in the circumstances set out in subsections (2) to (5) of clause 115 or subsections (2) to (4) of clause 116. That encompasses any behaviour that is a nuisance or annoyance to neighbours or persons residing in the district of the local authority, whereas the power to grant a power of arrest under clauses 115 and 116 is strictly limited to
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
cases of violence or threats of violence with a risk of harm to others. The power of the court to issue a bench warrant is not limited in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest that, except for cases where there is fear of witness being intimidated—a factor mentioned in an earlier debate—the same criteria should apply when a judge is considering whether to issue a bench warrant as when considering granting a power of arrest. It is inappropriate that the court should entertain applications for arrest and remanding in custody if no harm is threatened to others, such as in cases of noise nuisance. It is important to note that the power to issue a bench warrant arises only in cases where the judge, on the application for an injunction, either did not attach a power of arrest to the part of the injunction that the respondent is alleged to have breached, or did not attach a power of arrest to any part of the injunction. It is difficult to see why an alleged breach of an injunction granted in such circumstances should give rise to the power to grant a bench warrant, if the judge was not persuaded, or did not have the power, to grant a power of arrest when the case first came to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add the power to issue a bench warrant when necessary to avoid the court being frustrated by the respondent and if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the normal committal procedure—for example, the respondent being given advance notice of the allegation of the breach—will result in the respondent intimidating witnesses into refusing to give evidence. The local authority may then seek to have the respondent held in custody until the case is hard.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can be somewhat helpful. Amendment No. 329 would, as the hon. Gentleman said, remove the requirement under which somebody other than the person named in the injunction could be arrested for being in contempt of court for breaching that injunction. I am prepared to consider that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 314 would require that, where someone is arrested, the police should inform whomever took out the injunction—usually the local authority or another social landlord. Injunctions with a power of arrest attached will be sought and granted only in extreme circumstances, but it is right that, where housing officers have devoted what is likely to be a considerable effort to the case, they should be informed when the troublemaker has been arrested and removed from the locality. I am minded to consider the amendment in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My immediate reaction to amendments Nos. 330 and 331 was that they were unnecessary, but in light of the hon. Gentleman's explanation I am prepared to consider them also. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments, as I shall certainly undertake to table amendments that will realise the substance of amendments Nos. 329 and 314. I shall consider whether I need to do the same in respect of amendments Nos. 330 and 331.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>OFFENCE OF HARASSMENT OF RESIDENTIAL OCCUPIER</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>'(1) In this section "residential occupier" in relation to any premises means a person occupying the premises as a residence:
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) under a lease;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) under a contract;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) by virtue of any enactment or rule of law giving him the right to remain in occupation or restricting the right of any other person to recover possession of the premises.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>(2) If any person does any unlawful act or acts which interfere with the peace or comfort of a residential occupier or members of his household knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that that conduct is likely to cause a residential occupier to give up the occupation of his home or to refrain from exercising any right or pursuing any remedy in respect of his home, then that person shall be guilty of an offence if the residential occupier gives up the occupation of his home wholly or partly by reason of that act or those acts.</p>

	<p>(3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable—

	<ol>

	<li>on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both;</li>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not detain the Committee for long, as the new clause is very simple and, indeed, modest. It would create an offence of harassment of residential occupiers, and it sets out clearly who is regarded as being an occupier. It is a necessary response to the representations that have been made by constituents to Opposition and Conservative Members about the way in which individuals harass their neighbours or others. Subsection (2) would make it unlawful for any person to
	<br><blockquote><p>"interfere with the peace or comfort of a residential occupier or members of his household knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that"</p></blockquote>
the occupier might give up residence because of the act undertaken by the perpetrator of the harassment. I have heard at my constituency surgeries of such cases, and there are at present no means by which they can be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting the new clause and in choosing the level of punishment that courts may impose on a person convicted of the offence, we have been conscious of the need to send a message to those who harass and cause distress to neighbours and others that the House is not prepared to tolerate such activity. There is a great need for debate about noisy neighbours, for example, and last week we discussed the need to control those who act unlawfully. The new clause seeks to put on the record the fears of many citizens about the way in which they are being harassed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully and with interest to the attractive way in which the hon. Member for Leicester, East moved new clause 12. After superficial consideration of his speech, I can say that I have much sympathy with the objectives that lie behind the proposals. The hon. Gentlemen is not alone in having dealt with such problems in his constituency surgeries and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals will make it easier and quicker for landlords to evict anti-social tenants. We accept that anti-social behaviour is not restricted to the rented sector. A small minority of owner-occupiers—or, more often, their children—can make other people's lives a misery. As the Committee well knows, anti-social behaviour can affect people in all tenures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and accepting the objectives that lie behind the new clause, I must say that I have some doubts about its practicability. The criminal liability envisaged under the new clause would not come into effect until the people who were on the receiving end of such acts leave their homes. No offence would be committed until a resident gives up the occupation of his home wholly or partly because of that act or acts. Action should be taken before that stage is reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has said that nothing would happen until people vacate their premises. However, would not there be a history of complaints and registering incidents with the police or some other agency? So the point is that there would be a progression of incidents up to the time when premises are vacated. Will the Under-Secretary accept that view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that such matters often have a history, but I am making the point that action must be taken before an occupant leaves his home. I shall deal with the ways in which that can be done in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An act in unlawful for the purposes of this section if it is a crime or a tort."</p></blockquote>
I have some reservations about the way in which criminal actions and torts—two different matters—would be combined to make an unlawful act. The law of tort exists in part to regulate the relationships between neighbours in such matters as alleged acts of nuisance or trespass, but it might not be appropriate to mix torts with unlawful criminal acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that a wide range of remedies is available to home occupiers who are on the receiving end of unlawful acts of tort. They can seek injunctions or damages long before unlawful acts force them to leave their homes. I invite the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) to consider the fact that that is the appropriate way to deal with acts of tort, such as nuisance. Such acts must be dealt with before people are driven to leave their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be somewhat draconian to impose criminal liability when dealing with such matters, especially acts of tort, which have cause people to consider leaving their homes. If someone were to commit a nuisance towards a neighbour who decided to leave his home either wholly or partly because of that nuisance, it would be somewhat draconian for the neighbour responsible for the nuisance to face criminal liability. Not all nuisances are criminal acts. They are the sort of incidents in relationships between neighbours that are properly regulated by the law of tort, under which injunctions and damages are available. It is important to deal with unlawful acts that amount to criminal actions within the framework of the criminal law. It is also important that they are dealt with promptly and appropriately long before a home owner is forced to leave his home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respectfully remind the Committee of recent further legislative protection given under criminal law to home owners who are on the receiving end of such acts. The Criminal Damage Act 1971 include offences of destroying or damaging property or threatening to do so. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created a new offence to deal more effectively with intentional harassment, including racial harassment. Legislation also exists to deal with criminal assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leicester, East rightly mentioned the problems caused by noise, which are real for many home owners. Local authorities already have wide-ranging powers to prevent or abate noise nuisance under part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as amended by the Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993. They have a duty to investigate complaints about noise nuisance by owner occupiers or tenants. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
problem constitutes a statutory nuisance, the authority must serve an abatement notice on the person responsible, or on the owner or occupier of the premises. Contravention can lead to a heavy fine. The Committee may also be aware of a private Member's Bill that is intended to clarify and strengthen local authorities' powers to deal with noisy neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appropriate measures to protect residential occupiers already exist under civil and criminal law. They can be brought into operation before a home owner is forced to leave his home. I appreciate the problem that the hon. Member for Leicester, East has raised—problems are often caused by a minority of anti-social tenants. I accept the intention behind the new clause but, for the reasons I have given, it is unworkable, and the matter is already adequately covered elsewhere in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response. He focused only on when an occupier has to give up occupying his home. Subsection (2) of the new clause also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or to refrain from exercising any right or pursuing any remedy in respect of his home".</p></blockquote>
That gives the new clause a much wider brief—a fact that I hope that the Under-Secretary will take on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention two examples from my constituency. First, a council tenant was being harassed by an owner-occupier—which made it difficult for the council to deal with the problem. My constituent—the tenant—said that she felt that both the council and the police left her to deal with the problem on her own. She had been living in her home for 21 years. She said that her neighbours, who moved in relatively recently, tried to kick down her front door, trespassed into her garden, threw dog mess into the garden, made a noise nuisance and so on. In her letter, she mentions other examples of incidents that became more and more distressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She has had to have therapy as a result. A psychotherapist wrote to me, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"She has been very distressed because of the situation with her neighbours who have been racially and generally harassing her over recent years."</p></blockquote>
The psychotherapists says the woman
	<br><blockquote><p>"feels trapped in her own home—afraid to go out and then once out afraid to go back home."</p></blockquote>
When I made contact with the local police, who are generally supportive in such matters, they replied
	<br><blockquote><p>"The undertaking"—</p></blockquote>
which was given at one point by the neighbours—
	<br><blockquote><p>"quite frankly is a waste of time when the alleging behaviour continues."</p></blockquote>
The police also said that they were trying to get the court to consider an injunction with the power of arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary says that the existing law is adequate but the local police force says that it is inadequate and that we need a specific offence to cover such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case involved a constituent who appeared as a witness in a murder trial against a neighbour—which, as the Committee can imagine, was traumatic. After the neighbour come out of gaol, he continued to harass my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
constituent: he threw bricks through her window, threatened her with a machete and caused her extreme distress and grief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to highlight those two cases, which both involve council tenants. One of them wished to leaver her home and be transferred by the council, but the council has a policy of not transferring people who are harassed but trying to evict the harasser. The other tenant is being harassed by an owner-occupier over whom the council has little or no power. The new clause covers both those examples rather well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Under-Secretary says about not wanting to mix crimes and torts, but the tort of nuisance has stages that come close to criminal activity. The examples of nuisance that I highlighted should be considered criminal offences rather than simply civil ones. The Under-Secretary may not be able to accept the new clause as its stands, but will he think of some way of covering all different forms of property ownership and owners, so that people can have quiet enjoyment in their own homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has given the Committee some important examples. I have the utmost sympathy for her constituents and others who are in that position. In neither of the examples that she gave would there have been any offence committed under the provisions of the new clause before the "residential occupier" gave up the occupation of his home wholly or partly because of the acts complained of. That is a shame. It is important for tenants and home owners to have the protection of the law before we arrive at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's first example concerned noise, nuisance and trespass, and the police offered sound advice. The resident should have sought an injunction to restrain the person carrying out these acts. If the person had then gone on to carry out further acts in breach of the injunction, he would have been in a serious position—probably in contempt of court—and could have faced a prison sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that would happen at present. But there are difficulties in such cases because often there are no other witnesses, so getting an injunction is not easy. In the case which I cited, the police and the council are trying to work together. The Under-Secretary referred to someone leaving his home. Does he accept that if someone leaves his home temporarily to live with mum because he cannot face returning to his own home, he would be covered by the new clause, so the offence would apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause refers to causing
	<br><blockquote><p>"a residential occupier to give up the occupation of his home".</p></blockquote>
It is a matter for the hon. Lady to interpret that. My point is that something should happen before that stage is arrived at. The hon. Lady's second example sounded like criminal acts were being committed. Breaking windows and threatening someone with a machete sound like serious offences. Anyone threatening someone else with a machete would be in a serious position when brought before the criminal courts and could face a prison sentence or other appropriate sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
The hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) and hon. Friends will know that the law of nuisance regulates the relationship between neighbours. It can cover a wide range of activity that one neighbour believes to be obnoxious, while another thinks that he is behaving perfectly legitimately in carrying on his occupation. Smells very often constitute a nuisance and lead to torts. There is a decided case of the courts finding that the smell made by a fish and chip shop amounted to a nuisance. It was found to be an inconvenience that materially interfered with the ordinary comfort of human existence. I enjoy fish and chips and would never object to the smell, but someone else might find the smell of fish and chips obnoxious. The fish and chips shop owner faced civil proceedings brought by the occupier of a home who regarded the smell as a nuisance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman would be upset if we could smell fish and chips for the next two and half hours, and he could not get at them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am with the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proper course for someone who is affected by the smell of fish and chips or anything else is to go to court and seek an injunction and/or damages against the person emitting the smell. Suppose, however, that the person who was upset by the smell had decided instead to leave his home. Before doing so, he went to the owner of the fish and chip shop and said, "I am going to leave my home unless you give up cooking your fish and chips".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fish and chip shop owner may have said, "I am terribly sorry. I do not want to upset you, but this is my livelihood. My customers enjoy my fish and chips." If the residential occupier who was complaining about the smell of fish and chips went on to leave his home, that would fall within the ambit of the clause. He would have given up the occupation of his home by reason of the acts committed by the fish and chip shop owner, who would have known that he was likely to leave his home because of that, as the occupier had told him so, and the fish and chip shop owner could then find himself before the courts facing a criminal sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the Minister going on about the smell from fish and chip shops. Is it not fair to say that if a nuisance is caused by pollution from cooling fish and chips, that would come under the environmental health legislation, and the local authority environmental health department would be the department to monitor the pollution and take action? Are we comparing like with like in this example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair and important point. There may well be measures that can be taken by environmental health officers. Also, civil remedies are available to someone affected by such a smell. He can take the matter to the courts to seek an injunction and damages. That is the appropriate way to deal with such nuisances—not hauling someone before the criminal courts and leaving him to face imprisonment following conviction.

I offer that to the Committee as a somewhat lighthearted example, but a true one that might follow from the way in which the new clause would operate. It would cast the net far too wide.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) If a local authority is of the opinion that criminal proceedings for the breach of any byelaw would afford an inadequate remedy they may, for the purpose of ensuring that there is no further breach of that byelaw take proceedings in the county court for an injunction prohibiting any further breach of that byelaw or any other byelaw.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present section 23 of the Housing Act 1985 allows the local housing authority to make byelaws for the management and regulation of its houses. New clause 13 is simple and would clarify the vagueness in the Bill. Section 56 of the Act defines houses to include flats, but does not make it clear that that includes blocks of flats. There is therefore some uncertainty as to whether byelaws can be made covering common parts of blocks of flats rather than individual flats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was right to say that under section 23 of the Housing Act 1985 local authorities can make byelaws for the management, use
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
and regulation of their houses. More commonly, they can make byelaws in respect of land provided in connection with housing. Such byelaws, as Committee members may know, often relate to dogs on the grassed areas of estates or to the control of ball games, but they could cover more serious matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 13 proposes that, in addition to byelaws for the management, use and regulation of houses under section 23(1), authorities should also be able to make byelaws for blocks of flats. The amendment is unnecessary, as the definition of "house" already includes blocks of flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 14 concerns whether byelaws can be enforced using the civil law—injunctions—as well as by prosecution. We believe that the civil law already applies. If an action that is contrary to a byelaw constitutes a criminal offence or an actionable tort—for example, trespass or a nuisance—it is already possible to remedy a breach by injunction in appropriate cases.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clause 15 is to enable the courts to make a wide-ranging order to protect witnesses who are at risk of intimidation and their households, family or property. During pervious sittings, we have had much
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
discussion of anti-social behaviour on estates and in residential areas. We hope that the new clause will deal with a key concern, which is that there is currently no one offence that deals with the harassment of owner-occupiers, tenants or members of their families. New clause 15 would give local housing authorities, housing action trusts, registered social landlords or charitable housing trusts the power to apply to apply to the court for witness protection orders should witnesses be subject to intimidation. Applications could be made by local housing authorities or other social landlords when taking action for various reasons, including the possession of a dwelling, an injunction relating to a breach of tenancy or the breach of agreements, a trespass nuisance or an application for an injunction by the local authority using its powers under the Local Government Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Witness protection orders have a simple purpose. For instance, a social landlord may ask the court to consider the risk of a witness to an incident being intimidated by a third party. That risk may be to the witness or to his or her family or property. If the court decided that a risk existed, it could agree to a witness protection order to provide for protection against third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under witness protection orders, the court could make various provisions. It could restrict the respondent from a specified area completely, or at specified times. It could order an individual to remain within the curtilage of dwelling or other premises, or require an individual to enter a specified area only when accompanied by a third party. Other restrictions could be specified at the request of a social landlord, to protect witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The witness protection order will be backed up with a power of arrest. That will provide effective protection to people who have given witness statements in difficult, bitter and potentially violent situations. It is an important protection. It will have two effects. First, witnesses can have a legally based protection if the court judges that they, their property or family are threatened. Secondly, it will ensure that more people will come forward to make witness statements in difficult cases. Social landlords can apply can apply to the court for a witness protection order as a back-up in difficult cases. That will allow more witnesses to come forward. Without such protection, individuals would not come forward because of the consequences to themselves, their families and their property from individuals who faced severe penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause will give courts the power to take steps to protect witnesses from serious threats from third parties and, in due course, to allow witnesses to come forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that witness intimidation is a serious problem. I accept that new clause 15 has been moved with the best of intentions, to protect witnesses so that they feel able to give evidence in cases of unlawful acts or neighbour nuisance. I appreciate also that in some circumstances witness intimidation can be a major stumbling block for local authorities trying to bring anti-social tenants to court. The Government have recognised that and sought to deal with it in various ways. I respectfully refer the Committee to clause 108, which represents an important step forward in tackling witness intimidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with situations in which someone is prepared to act as a witness and give a statement or evidence about someone else's behaviour. As the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
Committee knows, there is often great hesitation on the part of tenants and owner-occupiers before they take such a course. Many of those who want to complain about unlawful acts and neighbour nuisance seek anonymity and protection from any possible consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 108 is an important measure in that regard. It contains a revised ground for possession based on nuisance and annoyance to neighbours. That has been strengthened in various ways, one of which is crucial to the issue before us. It will enable a landlord to evict a tenant for behaviour "likely to cause" nuisance or annoyance. That enables a third party, rather than the victim of the behaviour, to give evidence against the perpetrator. The victim does not need to take the considerable step—which it is for many people—of agreeing to be a witness and give evidence. The victim can make a complaint in anonymity and rely on evidence from third parties to secure the desired outcome and prevent the behaviour from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with the protection that can be afforded to witnesses who are prepared to come forward, give a statement and so on. It contains much that is already covered in clauses 117 to 119 and in clauses 115 and 121. Much of what the new clause seeks to achieve can be achieved by local authorities now. They can take out injunctions to restrain a respondent from intimidating witnesses. Where violence or the threat of violence is present, clauses 115 to 121 will provide an extremely effective means of preventing the tenant from harassing neighbours who may have complained about him. That was one of the Government's main intentions to tabling that amendment. The local authority will be able to obtain an injunction to prevent such activities. Breach of the injunction will mean immediate arrest under clauses 117 to 119.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is serious, and we have been examining other ways in which we might assist local authorities. Authorities that are unfortunately plagued by the problem of anti-social tenants have much experience in using the courts effectively to secure the quickest possible eviction. Other authorities, which are fortunate enough to have to seek eviction for nuisance or annoyance less frequently, may not be so familiar with the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason we will shortly issue guidance to local authorities on how to make best use of the courts. In that guidance we will deal with witnesses. We will remind local authorities that they can apply for non-molestation orders or for non-disclosure of witnesses' addresses, and that an application can be made ex parte before or during the proceedings. More generally, any means whereby the process of eviction is speeded up will cut down the opportunity for the perpetrator of such deeds—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether we are straying a little from the purpose of the new clause, which deals with the powers of the courts. The new clause seeks to leave it to the courts to make a decision and to balance the interests of the defendants and the witnesses. I am not clear how guidance to local authorities helps the courts. Surely the Lord Chancellor must give guidance to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee if I was straying. I wanted to explain how seriously the Government take the problem. The hon. Gentleman's points are covered by what I have already said about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
powers that the Committee has given the courts under clauses 115 to 121, which permit the courts to take out injunctions to restrain people from committing unlawful acts that affect victims and witnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are taking the matter seriously. I hope that I have convinced the Committee that important steps have been taken to protect witnesses and the sort of problems envisaged in the new clause are already being dealt with satisfactorily. There are powerful tools in place for the courts to deal with people who intimidate witnesses, one of the most important of which is the opportunity for third party witnesses to give evidence, thereby removing the fear, for many tenants, of having to give evidence at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to an article in the 
	<i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i> a few days ago on 28 February? The headline reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Residents 'too scared to go out'".</p></blockquote>
The article refers to an estate where residents have suffered from burglary and other crimes, so they asked for a public meeting. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A public meeting to discuss the problems of crime in one area of Leeds was held during the day because residents were too scared to venture out after dark."</p></blockquote>
It refers to an elderly lady, who would not reveal her name because she was afraid of the consequences. The Under-Secretary has referred to laws that are in place at present, so we would assume that residents in the Lincoln Green area could appeal to the police, who are aware of the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article continues with comments from a resident:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'We want the police to take action to stop our lives being made a misery by burglars and robbers.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Inspector Sam Warmington, Community Liaison Officer for the Chapeltown Police Division, urged residents to crackdown on the causes of crime by joining the police, Leeds City Council and social agencies to improve the area."</p></blockquote>
In other words, although there are already all the agencies to which the Under-Secretary referred, people are still too scared to venture out after dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must firm up the existing laws. I am sure that the problems in Leeds are mirrored in more than one estate in every constituency. We must protect residents who regard themselves as prisoners in their own homes. Unless we use this opportunity to take action, we shall be letting those people down. They are living in fear because existing laws do not protect them. Residents who give evidence in court are often subjected to abuse and further criminal damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must tell the people in the Lincoln Green area of Chapeltown in Leeds that we are on their side. We want to beat the vandals and the burglars. We would do that by accepting the principle of new clause 15. We are always being reminded of what happened under the previous Labour Government, but this had nothing to do with that. I am talking about a report of a few days ago issued under a Conservative Government. There is room for action. The Under-Secretary says that there is protection, but residents are still scared to venture out of their homes. We have an opportunity today to demonstrate to those people that we are on their side and want to do something about it. I ask the Minister to think very carefully about this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add briefly to the weight of my hon. Friend's argument. The problems on the estate that he has just described are mirrored throughout the country, particularly in areas such as mine. The whole thrust of the Bill and of the Government's argument is to give the estates back to the tenants and residents. Millions of pounds of Government money is spent regenerating these estates. We all recognise the problems that have developed over the years and surely we can start giving th estates back to the tenants through this new clause and give them the impetus to create the better estates that we want to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many estates there are large families who occupy flats throughout the estate and who intimidate some of the witnesses who come forward. The new clause prevents that happening. As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton pointed out, the current laws do not go to the heart of the matter. This new clause, with its strong approach, hits all the subjects that are brought to us in our surgeries. The Minister has not convinced us of his argument. The new clause strengthens clearly the opportunity for the courts to protect witnesses from intimidation. We hope that the Minister will reconsider and accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Members for Normanton and for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe). I have every sympathy for the residents of Lincoln Green and any other estate in Leeds or Bradford who suffer these problems. I took on board the description which the hon. Member for Normanton gave of the conditions on the Lincoln Green estate, where residents are too afraid to give their names to newspaper reporters, to go to meetings or to go out at night. Such people are too afraid to put themselves forward as witnesses. The measure envisaged in clause 108, which removes the necessity for such people to put themselves forward as witnesses and allows their parties to act as witnesses, will remove much of their fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is apparent from the state of affairs that the hon. Member for Normanton described that people are too afraid to become witnesses and to initiate proceedings. Whatever measures we take, whether with this new clause or under clause 115 to 121, the residents are simply too afraid to make a complaint in the first place. The message that should go out to those people and to the local authorities is that there is now a new provision in the Housing Bill, which is shortly to become law, which will enable third parties to act as witnesses and to give evidence. That will remove the need for hard-pressed and frightened residents to give evidence at all. It should not be too difficult on an estate such as the hon. Gentleman described for the third parties to gain the evidence that they need. When that has been done and the action has been instituted, the people who are responsible—the anti-social tenants whom hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to see dealt with firmly—will find themselves in a serious position. Under clause 108 they will be in jeopardy of losing their own accommodation and leaving the estate altogether, which is something that other residents would welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Under-Secretary saying that is someone who is accused of creating a nuisance or damage on an estate pleads not guilty, the person who reported the matter and made a statement to the police will not be called as a witness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I direct the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 108. The evidence that can be given to establish a ground under that clause can be given by a third party according to the way in which the clause is worded. That will be in the message that will go out. The sort of person he described would not have to give evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting; we are moving away from an existing law. Is the Under-Secretary saying that individuals who plead guilty will not have to appear before a court, but that a third party who took the evidence from a witness can appear on behalf of that witness without giving any details about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Evidence would have to come from third parties about what they say taking place while they were on an estate. I apologise for revisiting an earlier debate, but the key words are found in clause 108, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tenant or a person residing in or visiting the dwelling-house…has been guilty of conduct which was"—</p></blockquote>
here is the important part—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or is likely to have been a nuisance".</p></blockquote>
A third party can given evidence about what
	<br><blockquote><p>"is likely to have been a nuisance or annoyance to a person residing, visiting or otherwise engaging in a lawful activity".</p></blockquote>
There must be evidence about what a person has done, but it need not come from someone on the estate who has been a victim of that person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I heard the Under-Secretary say that the third party must witness the incident. Therefore, that person would be a first witness. The Under-Secretary is moving away from the present practice in which a person is accused of criminal damage, vandalism or any offence if the police act on a statement made to them. If that person pleads not guilty and is taken to court, one of the problems for those who made the statement and others is that they are called as witnesses. They have to substantiate their statements to the court for it to make a decision. However, the Under-Secretary seems to be saying that third parties can present the evidence if they witness an incident. The matter is becoming misted because we want to strengthen existing laws, but the Under-Secretary has not reassured us about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. It is important to bear in mind the fact that we are talking about civil proceedings for possession of a house, not about any criminal proceedings resulting from the act about which complaint was made. We are talking the sort of conduct that causes a nuisance or annoyance to someone living on such an estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Vandalism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, vandalism might be criminal damage or it might be the sort of unlawful behaviour with which we are dealing. The point is that third parties, not the resident who complains, can give evidence relating to civil proceedings for possession. Residents can complain to the local authority which can take up the matter and seek the evidence necessary to establish unlawful conduct on the part of the person causing the problems. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
removes the necessity for the resident to give evidence, so removing their fear of doing so. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. I hope also that the people on estates, such as Lincoln Green to which the hon. Gentleman referred, will welcome this innovation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard an interesting exchange on an important issue which is crucial to those who want to give evidence against individuals in such cases. If the Opposition thought that the mater had been dealt with in other clauses, we should not have tabled new clause 15. We did so for clarity and specifically to ensure that witnesses who give evidence obtain statutory back-up from courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton referred to an estate in Leeds in which individuals feared the intimidation that occurred following incidents to which they were third-party witnesses. They felt intimidated about giving evidence because courts offer them no statutory protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South said about subsection (11) of the new clause, which would provide an innovation that should be emphasised. It would mean that an individual against whom a witness was giving evidence could not ensure that his or her mates went round committing damage to the witness's property, family or person at a later date. It would give the courts power to consider that issue and make sure that witness protection was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome that the Under-Secretary said about guidance for local authorities and we would welcome further discussion in due course. For now, new clause 15 weeks to ensure that courts have powers, if social landlords or housing authorities request action, to grant witness protection to those who give evidence in difficult and often dangerous cases. We want simply to clarify and strengthen statutory protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That power is not likely to be used frequently. IT may only be used in cases such as those referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton. But if the housing authorities or social landlords feel that witnesses need protection, and if they can make a clear and unassailable case to the courts, the courts have a duty to offer protection to ensure that a witness will be able to give evidence. In addition, more witnesses would be willing to come forward to give evidence if they felt that they had the security of the court and the protection of the law around them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how a Government who are concerned about victims can ignore our pleas to make sure that witnesses have protection. We do not believe that that is provided by the Bill. That is why we have tabled the new clause. Unless the Minister says something dramatic, we shall have to force the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is intended to probe what the Government are doing. We shall not push it to a vote at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union issued a directive last summer requiring the UK Government to amend the Data Protection Act 1984 to bring it in line with the directive. The first question is, when will the Government do that? Will they do it through primary legislation or by regulations? As I understand it, the Government must have the new legislation in place by either June or October 1998. Can the Minister tell us how the Government intend to proceed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 30 years, housing management has changed dramatically. There was a time when the majority of people involved in housing management had worked their way up from rent collectors or other related jobs. When I was first elected a council in Oldham, the housing manager had been a rent collector and had a fund of information and acknowledge about the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was perfectly all right—up to a point. I remember going to see him on one occasion about a tenant, and before I could open my mouth he assured me that the fact that she was not getting what she wanted had nothing to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
do with the fact that she had set the dog on him when he was a rent collector. He was keen to claim that everything was being done on a professional basis and that the argument that they had had about the dog had nothing to do with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fund of local information has on the whole disappeared. The majority of people involved in housing management now have professional qualifications. They tend to have a good knowledge of housing management, but they lack that fund of background information about tenants and neighbourhoods, which often served people well, but was perhaps also a cause of some unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for housing managers now is that they are told with hindsight that a particular tenant has been placed inappropriately and that there is bound to be trouble. They are frustrated because they do not think that they are given sufficient information. That frustration is considerable, and I have to say that it would not be relieved by the new clause. There is little that can be done about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly easy, when a police officer has been called to an incident at a tenant's address, for him to ask the housing manager why on earth the tenant had been placed there when it was perfectly obvious that there would be a problem, because of some piece of information, such as the fact that the tenant's husband had just come out of prison. The poor housing manager does not have that crucial piece of information and feels a right fool that he has placed a tenant inappropriately as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter how good the system for passing on information, the information emerges only with hindsight. It also often happens that the housing manager is told by two or three neighbours of some information about a new tenant which, had he had it before, would have led him to put the tenant elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is especially acute for housing associations with small numbers of properties. Most of the nominations come from the local authority, and occasionally a housing association may feel that the authority has nominated a particular tenant to get rid of him from an estate. There may be resentment that the information supplied about a tenant is insufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a substantial problem, but I recognise that it cannot be solved simply by changing legislation. We must also balance the rights of the individual citizen. The Data Protection Act 1984 carefully sets out rights to protect an individual, especially from the holding of false information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember, however, that at this stage the data protection legislation covers only information held on computers, not that on paper files. The most recent example of slight prejudice by a housing manager that I can remember concerned a paper file. When I went to talk to him, he pointed to a file about three inches thick and said simply, "You realise that we have a problem with this tenant,"—because of the thickness of the file. I accept that legislation does not a present deal with paper files. I hope that when the Government amend the Data Protection Act 1984, they will bring paper files within its ambit. Once files are covered by the Act, individuals on whom files are kept will have a right to see them and to ask for corrections to be made, which may occasionally cause problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing which is exempt from the Data Protection Act 1984—and which, as I understand it, will remain exempt under the European Union directive—is information held by the police. That is where problems arise: on occasions, the police feel unable to pass certain pieces of information to housing departments. As I understand it, they can normally pass on a tenant's criminal record—although even that is occasionally frustrated, and a housing department that wants to bring a civil prosecution is unable to get hold of the criminal record. That may arise when a housing department is applying for an eviction because a tenant has been involved in violence to neighbours. It is important for the council to have the full criminal record, but it is often difficult to obtain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least the criminal record is held, and the person on whom it is held has the right to have it corrected. But the police have a large amount of information which comes under the category of criminal intelligence. A police officer may well have been called to an address at which there was an obvious threat of violence and been able to calm the situation. As a result, there will not have been a prosecution. If that happens three or four times and it is obvious that one tenant is to blame and the other is a totally innocent party, the innocent tenant will rightly want the housing authority to bring proceedings to obtain an eviction order. Then the question is whether the housing authority is able to call the police as witnesses or to get a statement from the police for the civil proceedings. That is where housing authorities find themselves in difficulty. The new clause would confer on them the right of access to such information from the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult area, and I do not expect the Minister to be able to accept the new clause, but I expect him to tell us the timetable in which the Government propose to implement the EU directive. When will we have new legislation or, if the Government intend to implement the directive by regulation new regulations? I hope that the Department of the Environment will have a clear input into such regulations to try to solve some of the difficulties of housing management. I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has listened with interest to the exposition of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). The hon. Gentleman has given us the benefit of his knowledge and analysis of the Data Protection Act 1984 and the current position with regard to Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would exempt social landlords from the requirement under the Data Protection Act 1984 to provide information held on computerised records to someone while landlords were considering or taking possession proceedings on grounds of anti-social behaviour, or while they were considering or taking out injunctions for the same reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is not entirely clear. I had assumed that it stemmed from concern that information provided could identify witnesses who were prepared to testify against the tenant in possession proceedings—thus opening up the possibility of intimidation. However, if that is part of the purpose of the new clause, the provision is not needed, because under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
section 21(4) of the Data Protection Act, social landlords would not have to provide information about identifiable third parties who have not given their consent to information being disclosed to the person making the request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the European Community directive in which I realise he has an interest. The Government are shortly to consult on the way in which the directive should be implemented in the United Kingdom and amendments to the Data Protection Act are likely to be made in the coming two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee have heard the expression many times. As an experienced Member of the House, the hon. Gentleman is able to interpret it as he wishes. However, if it will assist, I shall try to give him more precise information in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for paper records, the hon. Gentleman knows that access to personal files under 1989 housing regulations relates to information held on paper in connection with a tenancy. The information must be provided on request and if there are inaccuracies the local authority has to amend. This parallels the Data Protection Act: information about a third party cannot be released unless the third party agrees. I hope that my comments on the general purpose of new clause 18 and on the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman will satisfy the Committee and persuade the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>TENANCIES WHICH ARE ASSURED SHORTHOLD TENANCIES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 338, in page 44, line 20, after 'tenancy', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'which is subject to a written tenancy agreement'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The management would allow assured shorthold as the default tenancy only when there is a written and signed tenancy agreement. IT would also limit the weakening of security of tenure for private tenants. In particular, it would retain the assured tenancy as the default tenancy in all tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assured shorthold tenancies allow landlords to evict tenants legally and speedily at the end of a tenancy, which, it typically, is for six months. At present, to create an insecure tenancy, the landlord must give notice to the tenant that the agreement will be a shorthold one; this must be done in a certain legally defined way. If a
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
landlord does not give proper notice, or does so incorrectly, the tenancy will be an assured tenancy giving greater security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government introduced assured shorthold tenancies, it was felt that as tenants would have limited security in their homes, landlords must, to create such insecure tenancies, be legally obliged to ensure that tenants knew of the nature of the tenancy. Requiring a notice stating the nature of the tenancy encouraged responsible landlords renting through proper legal contracts, and a well-ordered private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allowing all tenancies by default to be shorthold tenancies dispenses not only with the need for the tenant to be given prior warning of the limited security, but with the need for written tenancy agreements. In the absence of written notices, or tenancy agreements, a regime of oral tenancies would prevail. That would remove the present incentive to landlords who are willing and competent to let professionally. It would also be much more difficult for tenants to assert their right sand much easier for landlords to abuse theirs. Written agreements and notices provide both landlords and tenants with much-needed information on their contractual rights and obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most responsible landlords wish to offer written tenancy agreements which outline their and their tenants' responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not affect such landlords, but would encourage and promote responsible renting by disadvantaging those irresponsible landlords who do not want written agreements. Competent landlords usually know and fulfil their legal responsibilities to their tenants and, in keeping with their knowledge of the law, will let their properties by way of deliberately created assured and assured shorthold tenancies. Those landlords are less likely to harass tenants, to fail to do repairs, to have inadequate insurance or to inform their mortgage lender that the property is tenanted. Unscrupulous landlords often let without notice or written agreements because it is less expensive to do so and because they do not want tenants to know about the landlord's responsibilities. At present, such unscrupulous landlords are controlled by casual tenancies defaulting to fully assured tenancies with greater security, thus giving their tenants much-needed protection. IF the clause remains as drafted, there will be an influx of latter-day Rachmans taking advantage of their tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incompetent landlords tend to know neither their rights nor their responsibilities or those of their tenants. They are exemplified by the sort who let their property via cards in tobacconists' windows or advertisements in local newspapers. They frequently neither know nor care about agreements, deposits and obligations regarding repairs and safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the important subject of assured shorthold tenancies and changes in the basis for creating such tenancies. It may be helpful to the Committee in considering the amendment to be aware of the background to the issue, especially of clause 75, which provides that any new assured tenancy will automatically be a shorthold, unless it is specifically excluded. The exclusions are listed in schedule 2A to the 1988 Act, as inserted by schedule 4 to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will therefore not longer be necessary for a landlord to serve a prior notice on a special form, saying that the tenant is to have an assured shorthold tenancy. That will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
prevent landlords accidentally creating full assured tenancies through ignorance or inexperience. Those landlords who wish to let property on full assured terms will still be able to do so, by serving a simple notice to that effect, or by including a simple declaration the tenancy agreement itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction f assured shorthold tenancies is an important factor in the recent revival of the private rented sector. Since 1988, the sector has increased from 1.7 million households to just over 2 million households. When shorthold tenancies were introduced, tenants were accustomed to regulated tenancies which gave long-term security of tenure, however, shorthold tenancies have now been around for about seven years and they are the norm. The current procedure for creating shorthold assured tenancies is unnecessarily complicated. We do not believe that there is a case for retaining it, particularly as it puts landlords off letting their property altogether. They often leave the property empty and perhaps let it fall into disrepair. The clause will simplify procedures and make it easier to be a landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 338 would require landlords to issue a written tenancy agreement if a tenancy is to be a shorthold assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any sensible landlord wants a written agreement. Not only does it act as a clear statement of who is responsible for what, but it puts the landlord in a much stronger legal position should anything go wrong. For example, should he need to seek possession, he would easily be able to prove what kind of tenancy exists, and what the terms of the agreement were. If the landlord wants to recover his property using the accelerated possession procedure, he must have had a written agreement with his tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would create another procedural trap for landlords. Those who failed to issue a written agreement would find that they had created a full assured tenancy. That is exactly the scenario that clause 75 will end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear from the amendment at what stage during the tenancy the landlord would have to issue the written agreement. I assume that the intention is for the written tenancy agreement to be issued in advance. Otherwise, the amendment would have little practical effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister. There are many examples of landlords who do not have written agreements.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to put shorthold tenancy on a different basis with a special set of procedural requirements, such as those that the hob. Gentleman proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can go some way to giving the hon. Gentleman some assurance—I emphasise "some". We are prepared to consider requiring landlords to give tenants, on request, a statement of the principal details of the agreement, including the rent and the basis of the tenancy. That would be appropriate only for those tenancies that were not in writing. However, it would not be appropriate to compel landlords to issue assured shorthold tenants with written agreements, for the reasons that I have outlined. I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with amazement to the Minister's statements. He said that a sensible landlord would have a written agreement. I agree with him. But if that is so, why do not we ensure that it happens? We heard a lot about landlords. It is important to ensure that we have a properly regulated private rented sector if the proposals that we shall discuss later come to fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed by the Minister's reply, because if we mean to ensure that landlords and tenants in the private rented sector operate in a businesslike way, written agreements are a prerequisite. The Government would like the private rented sector to expand. They would like homeless and vulnerable people to go into the private rented sector. I—and, I suspect, other members of the Committee—want to create stability for landlords and tenants. That is in everyone's interest. A new Housing Bill should clarify matters, not muddy the waters. But that happens when one relies on oral agreements. The Minister himself made the argument for the case that many of us support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do tenants who have no proper written agreements deal with safety in their homes? I am a member of the National COGAS group, which is concerned about the number of deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning. I can give the Minister a case study of tenants who tried to take action against their landlord without security. If tenants do not have written agreements, landlords will be able to get away with telling them, "just get out if you don't like what's happening." Many such cases have been recorded. I will describe one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Barrister and her student husband rented a fairly expensive flat in Newham. It look well maintained and decorated. They were more than able to afford the rent, the home was convenient for their work and they were happy there. Two or so years after they moved, their dog became seriously ill, They discovered that lethal carbon monoxide fumes were escaping from their gas fire. The gas board condemned the fires and the tenants wrote to the landlord informing him of that. His response was to tear down the gas board notices and to suggest that they leave the home. After receiving advice, the tenants discovered that the landlord had failed to create an assured shorthold tenancy and they were unable to take action. That can happen in many rented properties if we rely on oral tenancy agreements. If the Under-Secretary is not convinced by such arguments, he should be concerned about safety. We should be clarifying the legal situation, not muddying the waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced. The purpose of the clause is to make it more simple to create assured shorthold tenancies and to remove procedural tabs.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary made great play about sensible landlords who act with integrity. The amendment would encourage all landlords to be sensible. Is not that a good objective to pursue? If the Under-Secretary believes in sensible landlords, the amendment would be the way in which to achieve such an aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be sensible for the landlord to have a written tenancy agreement. It would be in his own interests. However, that does not mean that all landlords who enter into oral agreements are bad landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary reflect on the matter as it is extremely serious? He said that the Government propose that the landlord should issue a statement setting out the terms and conditions after the tenancy had begun. Being a lawyer, the Under-Secretary will know that, when a person enters into an agreement and decides to live in a particular house, a contract has been created and its terms and conditions cannot be changed. The Government's proposal goes against tenants under contract law, because terms and conditions would be imposed after the contract has been entered into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person enters into the contract when he has taken up the tenancy and a certain course of action must be followed. Under the Government's proposal, there will be further litigation because the tenant will go to the court and claim that the landlord be stopped from changing the terms and conditions. Will the Under-Secretary seek advice on the legality of what is being proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman allow me to complete the first part of my argument, I shall then deal with his point. He must accept that an oral agreement is every bit as much of an agreement as a written agreement. Under the amendment, where a landlord and tenant intend to create assured shorthold tenancy, there would be a risk, in the absence of a written agreement, of the tenant being granted a fully assured tenancy. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that such a position would be out of all proportion to the deficiency of having failed to provide a written agreement in the first place. He will be aware of the importance that Conservative Members attach to making such practice as simple as possible. We want to encourage landlords to let properties and we do not wish to put procedural handicaps in their way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the hon. Gentleman to be clear about the concession that I am willing to make. I shall consider making it a requirement for landlords to give their tenants, on request, a statement covering the details of the agreement so that the tenant will have the opportunity of seeing the agreement in writing. However, that will not alter the agreement itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not cover my point. If I make a promise to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham,
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
East, we are bound even though it was an oral promise. We are trying to avoid disputes, not create them. I agree with what Lord Denning said in a famous judgment: If one writes it down, on is bound. That is the problem with putting an agreement in writing so that people are clear where they stand at the outset, not half way through the tenancy when matters might have changed? The Under-Secretary is proposing something that happens after the tenancy has commenced, which means imposing new terms and conditions. I believe that the proposal is in breach of contract law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it clear that what I proposed was by way of considering taking such a step and giving the tenant the right on request to receive a statement of the main details of the agreement that has already been concluded. I was not talking about changing the terms of the agreement but about letting tenants have a statement of what has been concluded, which would assist them. An oral agreement is every bit as good as a written agreement, and there is no reason why a landlord should face the great, disproportionate step of having a sure shorthold tenancy converted into an assured tenancy by reason of its absence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As a chartered surveyor who has had to deal with such agreements and sort out some of the muddles that have been caused by inadequate agreements being served in the first place, may I ask my hon. Friend to reflect very carefully on the matter to see whether it would be sensible to create a simplified mandatory form of agreement? My hon.

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With these amendments, we are continuing our debate about security for people living in the private rented sector. I propose that the minimum period before which a recovery order takes effect for shorthold properties should be 12 months. That is particularly important for families. It is anticipated that many vulnerable families—I stress that I am talking of families—will come to live in the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A six-month tenancy does not give a family adequate security or stability. It makes it incredibly difficult for families to establish themselves in the local community, to find schools and GPs, and to discover where the best shops and other local facilities are to be found. Families that have constantly to move from one property to another are always having to sort out gas, electricity, water and council tax bills. If they receive benefits, they will also need to make new claims for housing benefit and income support. The added costs of moving home have to be considered for those who live on fixed incomes, as does the fact that moving home is one of the most traumatic and disturbing experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The desire for a stable home is a basic human instinct. If we are to improve the nation's housing and the lot of homeless people, we should be considering ways to ensure that families have some security. We have heard much about landlords. I agree with the Government that we should encourage landlords to provide housing in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
private rented sector. I believe that stability is also in the interests of landlords. Even if landlords do not want to be involved in that sort of letting, they will still have the option to let for less than 12 months, as they can do now. Owner-occupiers who want to let their properties for three months while they are abroad can arrange an assured tenancy for a fixed term, giving notice that the dwelling might be recovered under ground 1—that the landlord occupied it as his main or principle home, or that his spouse intends to occupy it. It will still be possible for landlords to let for shorter periods than 12 months. There is usually no difficulty in such circumstances, but if there is a problem, the accelerated possession procedure can be used. Landlords can cite various grounds if tenants do not move out when short lets are over. Other grounds apply for student lets or holiday lets. If the amendment was accepted, landlords could still let for less than 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the other matters that the Government are concerned about is rent arrears. We shall consider that at another time. However, there are ways of getting tenants out of a property. The amendment would encourage responsible tenants—and responsible landlords, who want to make sustainable investments. We know that many landlords want longer-term tenancies. It is in their interests to have tenants who remain for a considerable period with stability, so that they may receive a return on their properties. Moreover, if tenants know that they will remain for some time, they have an incentive to look after the property for the landlord, as it is their home. As has been shown, the lower the turnover of tenants and the lower the void rates, the better the investment will be for the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we all want the private sector to house many more people than it does at the moment, it must be in everyone's interest to ensure that tenants and landlords alike have security, and I have argued that that is in the interests of both. Landlords may still let properties for shorter periods, and the law will still enable them to secure repossession. Given the views of the Under-Secretary and his Department on the role of the private sector, I hope that he will consider the amendments carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee if I deal first with the purpose of clause 76, which follows on from the procedural change that has been made in clause 75 with regard to the creation of assured shorthold tenancies. Clause 76 amends section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. That section sets out the procedure for a landlord to recover possession when a shorthold tenancy expires at the end of the initial fixed term which currently must be at least six months. An amendment is needed because clause 75 of the Bill will remove the requirement for a new shorthold tenancy to have an initial fixed term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 76 will prevent a court from making an order under section 21 for possession of a new assured shorthold tenancy until six months after the beginning of the tenancy at the earliest. Where the tenancy is a replacement tenancy, the possession order may not be made to take effect until six months after the beginning of the original tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will ensure that shorthold tenants retain their existing right to a minimum of six months' security of tenure—I remind the Committee that that was the period for assured shorthold tenancies in the Housing Act 1988—even if their tenancy agreement has no initial fixed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has read out the purposes of the clause in terms that are fairly easy to understand. Why is not it possible to do that in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have set out the way in which the clause will operate. As I have said, the clause is necessary because clause 75 has changed the procedural requirements for assured shorthold tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaps to his feet, I should say that the clause establishes that the minimum period of an assured shorthold tenancy will be six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) makes is that the Under-Secretary is able to explain eloquently and clearly what clause 76 means, but, as it is drafted in the Bill, the clause would not win many awards for plain English. For example, subsection (6)—which amendment No. 340 would delete—states that the reference to the original tenancy is
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the replacement tenancy came into being on the coming to an end of a tenancy which was not a replacement tenancy, to the tenancy on the coming to an end of which the replacement tenancy came into being".</p></blockquote>
That is as clear as mud. What my hon. Friend was saying, and what amendment No. 340 seeks to ensure, is that we need to be clear about what we mean. The clause deals with a complicated area of the law, and it should not be the case that lawyers benefit from the fact that the Bill is unclear. The Under-Secretary is a lawyer and a man of common sense, and all that my hon. Friend and I are asking is that we be clear what we are saying. I ask the Under-Secretary to re-examine amendment No. 340 and to come up with a better form of words that would explain exactly what is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that lawyers would not always win awards for plain English, but I am at one with him in trying to stop unnecessary benefits accruing to lawyers as a result of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began my address in the way that I did because the Committee must see the matter in the context of the change that has been made in clause 75. Through clause 75, the Committee has changed the original basis of the Housing Act—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish this before the hon. Gentleman makes a further point? The original basis for the assured shorthold tenancy was that a landlord and tenant could enter into an assured shorthold tenancy through the provision of a notice by the landlord and an agreement between them for a fixed term of no less than six months. Failing that, the normal tenancy—the default tenancy—would be a full assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
Clause 75 has changes that so that an assured shorthold tenancy will be the default tenancy, save in the circumstances set out in the relevant schedule to which we have referred, which sets out the circumstances in which tenancies will be assured tenancies rather than assured shorthold tenancies, one of which will be the case in which a notice is served by the landlord establishing that it will be a fully assured tenancy, rather than an assured shorthold tenancy. I hope that that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that, all the way through the Bill, the Under-Secretary has assumed that we could understand it. Suddenly he has reached a clause that he thinks is so oddly worded that he must explain it to us. Perhaps that gives us a message. I hope that when he deals with amendment No. 340, he will think of better wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have explained the effect of the measure sufficiently clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says no. I invite him to consider that the assured shorthold tenancy is now the default tenancy, in effect. It is therefore important for the Committee to know that there will be a minimum period for the assured—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman let me finish the sentence, before he leaps in with his customary searching powers of analysis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point for the Committee to remember is that, however the assured shorthold tenancy comes into being, the minimum period of security remains the same, at six months. The measure is a different way of achieving the same minimum period of security of six months. If the hon. Gentleman is about to tell me that that is wrong, I should be interested to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Under-Secretary thinks that it takes searching powers of analysis to work out that subsection (6) is gobbledegook. Does he accept that? If he wants it to have the effect that he has outlined, does he accept that he must reword it, because it is important for ordinary people to understand what legislation means? At present, it is impossible to work out what subsection (6) means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause means that the tenant has security of tenure for a minimum period of six months, whatever the original fixed term of the tenancy says, and whether or not it has been succeeded by replacement tenancies. So the period of security always goes back to the beginning of the original tenancy, in order to guarantee the tenant a minimum period of security of six months, whatever the initial period is said to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I defer to the Under-Secretary on his analysis of the law. However, how would the good people of Chester, for example, understand the phrases that appear in subsection (6)(a)7? We understand what the Under-Secretary is trying to achieve. Why does he not

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The good people of Chester have the inestimable advantage of being represented by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester (Mr. Brandreth), who can bring great clarity, wit and wisdom to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the people of Chester and those elsewhere to know the effect of the Bill. Apart from arguments and quibbles about wording, that is the important effect of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch raised an important point of principle about what the minimum period of security should be, which is slightly different from the question of the procedures under which tenancies are created. I listened carefully to the hon. Lady's speech. She was anxious that landlords and tenants should be allowed flexibility. I invite her to consider the fact that landlords can contract with tenants for whatever fixed term they want, so long as the effect is to give more than six months' security. So a landlord can contract with a tenant for a year or for two years, during which time the tenants have the benefit of security. The important point is that six months is the minimum period, which allows landlords flexibility in several circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Under Secretary has said, but he has yet to deal with the main problem. If the private rented sector is to be used to house those who might previously have been housed in the social rented sector, we must ensure that the limit is not six months but 12 months, in the interests of keeping together vulnerable families. We are talking about vulnerable families, and I clearly referred to the effects on them. The Under-Secretary is right to say that there are many forms of tenancy agreements, including ones for less than six months, as I have said. I am worried about what going into the rented sector will mean for those who are new to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Lady's view and the sympathies that lead her to it. However, she is revisiting the Housing Act 1988, under which the six-month minimum period of security was established. I see no reason to change that period because of anything that has taken place since 1988. In fact, the average period during which an assured shorthold tenant stays in the same premises—either through a fixed-term tenancy, or a succession of replacement tenancies—is much longer than six months. I might be wrong, but I understand that the average stay is approximately three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that both parties should have an opportunity to enter into an agreement at the beginning of the tenancy so that they know where each other stands. Landlords should have the flexibility to let houses for whatever period they want, subject to a minimum period of six months. For example, a landlord might want to go abroad for six months, after which he might want to return to his house. The effect of increasing the minimum period from six months to 12 months will be to deny the landlord
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
that opportunity, thereby ensuring that his house remains empty rather than providing a six-month tenancy for someone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has discussed the matter dealt with in amendment No. 339. The effect of amendment No. 339, would be to disallow repossession orders during the first six months of a replacement tenancy, which would give tenants additional security. The Opposition are concerned because we look at the big picture, which is that the Government are moving towards the private rented sector, that they want to deregulate as much as possible and that tenants are suffering because their rights are being diminished. Suspicion is building up within the Opposition about the Government's intentions on tenants' rights. The Government and Conservative Members have voted against a national mandatory register. They do not want there to be written contracts for tenancies. Amendment No. 339 would ensure that tenants' rights were supported. Although the Under-Secretary has referred to these matters, I want him to re-emphasise that tenants will be protected after the first six months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary should take a careful look at subsections (6)(a) and (b) of clause 16. I would not say that the Bill is one of the most perfectly drafted pieces of legislation. Can the Under-Secretary put his hand on his heart and say that he is proud of subsection (6)? Does he expect the majority of his constituents to be able to read and understand it? We have already got ourselves into something of a mess, because instead of repealing the legislation and reprinting it all in one place, we are inserting pieces into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can often see that problem in the Library; instead of getting a new print, pieces are stuck in to legislation and one has to try to work out how they fit together, which is often difficult. Unfortunately, it also happens in local authority libraries. Now we have a mess like this. Does the Under-Secretary believe that it is set out clearly and precisely, so that the ordinary person can work out what the legislation intends. If not, he must be a member of that lawyers' union that tries to make legislation complicated and difficult to understand, so that it can be interpreted only by people who charges fat fees. That is not good enough. It is a good example of how a little extra work—by the parliamentary draftsman if not by the Minister—would produce something plain, simple and easy to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amazingly, when the Under-Secretary told us how the clause worked, he seemed to be able to express it clearly. I always understood that if legislation could be easily described, it could be drafted to be easily understood. I ask the Under-Secretary to have another look.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to say anything this morning, but I have been driven to speak to condemn the parliamentary draftsman over subsection (6). The Under-Secretary kindly provided us with a hefty tome of notes on clauses, chopping down many tress in the process—the idea being that hon. Members would not dip into it. Unfortunately this hon. Member has dipped into it and has found a definition of subsection (6), which I commend to the Committee. The parliamentary draftsman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
has taken 68 words of gobbledegook to try to establish his meaning, but the other definition is couched in 40-odd words. I shall read it to the Committee, to see if hon. Members can understand it better than the definition in the Bill. The notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (6) defines the original tenancy in subsection (5) as the tenancy which immediately preceded the replacement tenancy, provided that the former was not itself a replacement tenancy, and where there have been successive replacement tenancies, as the tenancy which immediately preceded the first in the succession of replacement tenancies."</p></blockquote>
I commend that to the Committee. It is a great deal better than the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend will use that definition, and try to do a little better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the effect of the amendments, I must advice the Committee to resist them. Amendments Nos. 343 and 344, reflect the essential length of minimum security; and amendments Nos. 339 and 340 deal with minimum security for replacement tenancies, which would be a departure from the present policy of assured shorthold tenancies of giving six months' security from the beginning of the original tenancy. Amendments Nos. 339 and 340 would extend that to six months' security from the beginning of the replacement tenancy. That is against the policy of assured shorthold tenancies, which is to give a minimum period of security of six months and then for the parties to be able to reach an agreement between themselves. As I said earlier, it is also open to the parties to agree to a period of longer than six months in the first place if they wish to do so. We want as much flexibility as possible for landlords to bring property onto the market, subject to the minimum period of security of six months. On that basis, I must resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am also disappointed that the Under-Secretary did not outline his views on creating a more stable private rented sector.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 341, in page 45, line 18, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(8) The tenant may determine the tenancy at any time with no notice if he was induced to accept the tenancy by a false statement knowingly or recklessly made by the Landlord or any agent acting on his behalf.'.</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendment would be to allow the tenant to determine a tenancy if the Landlord or his agent had made a false statement. In effect, it would equalise the position between landlord and tenant, in the light of ground 17 proposed in clause 79.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frequently, tenants consulting advice agencies want to leave properties because they have accepted a tenancy that they would otherwise have rejected because the landlord lied or misled them about the condition of the property, or made the property appear more attractive or to be in a better condition than it was. It is clearly important to protect tenants from arbitrary eviction by landlords, and consequently a minimum rental period should be laid down in law during which tenants know that they are secure. Equally, there should be a method by which tenants can unlock themselves from tenancies based upon false promises. A landlord's main concern is that his property is rented out and bringing in regular income. If a tenant were to have the right to bring a tenancy to an end at any time, as long as reasonable notice were given, landlords should not have a problem with reletting without suffering a gap in their income stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be unreasonable to expect tenants who were leaving early by choice to contribute towards any legitimate costs of advertising incurred as a result.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
However, if a tenant wanted to leave because of an act, omission or false promise made by a landlord, he should have the right to do so without financial penalty. The amendment would allow tenants to terminate in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argued for the amendment on the basis that he seeks to equalise the position of landlords and tenants in the light of clause 79, which will allow a private landlord to end a tenancy if the court finds that he was persuaded to grant it by false information. In order to assess that proposition, it may be helpful if I explain the background. Local authorities and housing associations can already apply to the courts for possession of a secure tenancy obtained by deceit under ground 5 in schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985. Housing associations now let on assured tenancies, but there is no comparable ground for possession for assured tenancies under the Housing Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an offence under section 74 of the Housing Act 1985 knowingly or recklessly to withhold information in connection with an application for assistance under the homelessness legislation. Provisions in clause 132 will create a similar offence for statements in connection with an application for housing through the housing register. It is only reasonable that a tenant, having had a claim for housing disproved, should forfeit the tenancy in favour of other households with a better claim to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explains the position of assured tenants of social landlords. Assured tenancies may also be granted by private landlords. There is no reason why a private landlord should not be able to repossess his property if a court finds that he was persuaded to grant the tenancy on the basis of false information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leicester, East argued that the new clause would equalise the position between landlords and tenants. But, as he will know, most representations made by a landlord would in fact normally be a term of the tenancy agreement. For example, if a landlord promises that certain facilities will be available, it becomes a term of the tenancy to provide them. If the landlord reneges on the promise—by failing to provide the facilities—he will be in breach of the agreement. The ordinary legal remedies would then be available to the tenant through the courts for him to try to enforce his rights under the terms of the agreement. Under those same general legal remedies, the tenant may then have the right to take action against the landlord for misrepresentation—which again could have serious legal consequences. Misrepresentation may give the tenant important legal rights. The position of tenants who have allegedly been subject to misrepresentation from misleading statements is covered by the general law, meaning that the amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause and the amendment effectively do the same thing. We want matters to be clear and in writing. Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 describes the procedure for obtaining possession of a property let on a shorthold tenancy. An assured shorthold tenancy must initially be granted for a fixed term. At the end of the term, the tenancy continues as a statutory periodic tenancy if the tenant remains in occupation. The period of tenancy is determined by how often the tenant pays rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To claim possession, the landlord must give the tenant two months notice. If the notice is served before or on the day on which the fixed term comes to an end, the two months can expire at the end of the fixed term or at any time afterwards. If the notice is served after the fixed term, the notice must expire at the end of the period of the tenancy. It must be at least as long as the notice to quite was agreed to be. A notice to quite must be at least as long as the period of the tenancy with a minimum length of four weeks. Thus, if an assured tenancy remains after the end of a fixed tern and the tenant pays rent every three months, the landlord would have to give at least three months notice rather than the usual two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 21 does not specify that notice must be given in writing. The Minister may wish to comment on whether that was an omission from the Housing Act 1988. It is difficult for a landlord to succeed in practice in a claim for possession of a property let on an assured shorthold tenancy without being able to produce written not ice, but it would be in everyone's interest if the notice were required to be in writing. There is no good reason for leaving the nature of the notice unspecified and every reason for stating that it must be in writing. That would assist landlords. A prescribed form could indicate the dates when notice could expire, which would enable landlords to be sure that they had complied with the requirements of section 21. The service of notice would be more straightforward for landlords if they could simply purchase a prescribed form and deal with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the amendment. Many of the amendments that we propose are in the interests of tenants and landlords and this is one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady and shall have to respond in a little detail, although I hope not to fall foul of the Committee's desire for matters not to be made over elaborate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 346 would require the notice for possession under section 21 to be served by the landlord in writing in a form that may be prescribed by regulations. At present, there is no specific requirement for the landlord to give notice of possession in writing in a prescribed form as there is for an assured tenancy. That is because the landlord has an automatic right to repossess the property in those circumstances and doe snot have to give a reason for doing

so. It also reflects the fact that the tenant would be aware that he has no security of tenure under a periodic shorthold tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However the current provision is not absolute clear as sub-section (4), which deals with the notice of possession for a contractual periodic tenancy, refers to the date specified in the notice. That implies that the notice would be in written form. Indeed, I would expect that a landlord who wanted to regain possession of his property would put notice of possession in writing, in order to be certain of gaining possession at the end of the notice or, if necessary through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware that the current provision is causing any real difficulty. However, as the hon. Lady has made a reasonable case for requiring the notice of possession for shorthold tenants to be in writing, I am prepared to consider clarifying the legislation in that respect. However, I see the need only for a simple statement that the landlord intends to seek possession, with notice of the date on which that possession is required. I do not consider that there is a case for prescribing the form of the notice in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 21 requires the landlord to give two months' notice of possession proceedings in the case of assured shorthold tenancies. I believe that the requirement is sufficient. That is the period of notice that was established in 1988, so it has been operation for some time now, and I believe that it is apt, given that the tenant in those circumstances will be aware that he has no security of tenure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To increase the notice to three months, as the hon. Lady suggests in new clause 28, goes against everything that we are trying to do under this chapter of the Bill. Our objective is to give landlords more confidence to let their property, safe in the knowledge that they can regain possession when they need to, subject to reasonable safeguards for tenants. We feel that we have struck the right balance with the present period of two months' notice. Increasing the requirement to three months would appear to landlords to impose further restrictions on their ability to regain possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Two months' notice gives the tenant a reasonable time to find alternative accommodation or—if he believes that he has the right to retain the tenancy—to start action to contest the landlord's right to possession. If the tenant believes that he has a right to retain the tenancy, the landlord cannot, of course, ask the tenant to leave without a court order for possession. The landlord cannot begin possession proceedings until the notice has expired. The case is then likely to take a little while to come before the court. Even if the court finds that the landlord has the right to possession, it will be for the judge's discretion when the order will come into effect. There is therefore no question of the tenant being thrown out into the street without a reasonable period to find alternative accommodation.

I urge the Committee to resist amendment No. 346 on the ground that I will consider instead whether a simple written notice should be required. I must also advise the Committee to resist new clause 28.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
