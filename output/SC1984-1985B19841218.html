	<section>

	<div class='title'>DISSOLUTION OF NATIONAL FILM FINANCE CORPORATION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Amendment proposed</i>[11 December], No. 11, in page 3, line 23, to leave out from the word 'transferred' to the end of line 34 and insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>,on the following legally enforceable conditions—

	<ol>

	<li>that the company will itself invest in the production of relevant films or will make available by way of financial facilities to those who wish to produce relevant films—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>any income derived from rights acquired from the Secretary of State under this section</li>

	<li>any trading profit made in the preceding year</li>

	<li>a sum equivalent to any sum received by way of grant or loan from the Secretary of State.</li></ol>

	<li>that the company will obtain the approval of the Secretary of State to the appointment or re-appointment of its chief executive.</li>

	<li>that the company, through its chief executive, will pay proper regard to the promotion of British film production as well as to the commercial viability of any particular film project and the commercial interests of the company.</li>

	<li>that the chief executive will report to the Secretary of State each year as to his and the company's fulfilment of the condition specified in paragraph (c) and that this report shall be laid before Parliament.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3A) In the event that no company can be found to meet the conditions specified in subsection (3), no order shall be made by the Secretary of State under paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the National Film Finance Act 1981 or under this section.' [
	<i>Mr. Gould.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also discussing the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 12, in page 3, line 27, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"on a commercially successful basis."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 13, in page 3, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) that at least one independent director shall be appointed to the board of the company to represent film producers."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 14, in page 3, line 31, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(cc) that it will have as a main objective the encouragement of new film makers.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 15, in page 3, line 31, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ccc) that the chief executive of the company shall have sole creative authority within a financial framework set by directors of the company under an independent chairman.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 36, in page 3, line 31, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) that the company will transfer to the Secretary of State a share or shareholding in the company which carries with it the power of veto on any decisions made by the company in pursuance of the conditions specified in paragraph (a) and (b).".</p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>

	<p>No. 40, in page 3, line 31, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) that one special share shall be retained by the Secretary of State to enable him to exercise a right to veto over transactions of the company if he deems that they are contrary to paragraphs (a) or (b). ".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 41, in page, 3, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(c) that no individual or organisation is granted any preferential terms for the acquisition of shares in the company.'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 42, in page, 3, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(c) that the shares in the company are initially available on equal terms to any member of the public.'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 16, in page, 4, line 16, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>`Subject to the provisions 3(cc) of this section.'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 37, in clause 4, page 4, line 35, leave out '(a) and (b)' and insert '(a) (b) and (c)'.
	<br><blockquote><p>`Subject to the provisions 3(cc) of this section.'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>I must draw the Committee's attention to the fact that we shall also be discussing two amendments that were starred at the previous sitting. They have now been added to this group, as this is clearly the proper time to debate them. We are, therefore, also discussing the following amendments:</p>

	<p>No. 51, in page 4, line 8, leave out 'of a person'.</p>

	<p>No. 52, in page 4, line 16, leave out 'that person' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>`the person or persons exercising such power'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that at our previous sitting there was general agreement throughout the Committee that it was important that the body to succeed the National Film Finance Corporation should be injected with an element of public responsibility. Although the Minister resisted the notion of inserting anything to that effect in the Bill, he was sympathetic to the general proposition that it would be wrong simply to hand over to a private commercial company the complete responsibility for fulfilling the functions that have been carried out by the NFFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition and probably some Conservative Members in the Committee retain the view that it is important to have something in the Bill. That something could take one of two forms. It could take the form of a general statement of obligation imposed on the company. I have said that the wording of clause 3 is now extremely loose, primarily because no obligation is imposed on the company. One remedy, which would satisfy most Committee members and almost everyone in the industry, would be to strengthen the wording of the clause so that it was clear to the company that it had an obligation with regard to the public interest and the future of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another method of achieving a similar result, upon which for a moment I thought the Minister looked Blighty more kindly and which I still hope he might be prepared to consider, would be to eschew the language of obligation by including in the Bill a provision in which, for example, it says that the Government will appoint the chief executive or the chairman, or both. Futhermore, it should be stated that a duty of independence in fulfilling his functions will be imposed upon him. I believe that the amendment of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
proposes a golden share, is on the same track, because it provides another mechanism whereby the public interest can be protected and fed into the operations of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still believe I think that I carry with me all hon. Members on the Opposition Benches and, I hope, some Conservative Members too that either an obligation or a mechanism should be in the Bill. We do not wish the company to be hamstrung, but we believe that it is not satisfactory for the clause to be retained in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that all of us would be much happier if the Minister would say whether the reserve power would be retained if the company were a limited company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a subtle distinction between limited partnerships and limited companies, which perhaps the Minister understands. If there is not to be a company per se, but the four bodies and any other bodies are to form a partnership that will administer the son of NFFC, we would be much happier if we knew that there would be written into the partnership deed, as it were safeguards in respect of the national assets and the party's attentions. If the Minister would accept that point, we might be nearer to being satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend draws attention to a matter that we raised in our previous sitting, and to which we have not yet had a reply. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to my hon. Friend's intervention, and to the matter that I was discussing when our previous sitting ended. Much reliance is being placed on the contract. The Minister offers nothing in the Bill, but instead a great contract which is to reslove all the problems. I hope, therefore, that he will tell us with whom the contract is to be made. If the Minister could give us some assurance on that subject the Committee would be more inclined to accept what he offers. But we need to know more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by drawing attention to a piece of paper that I imagine most members of the Committee have recieved since our previous sitting. The document is extraordinary in that it has been issued by six of the major organisations in the film industry. Those are the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians—the major trade union in the industry—the Association of Independent Producers, the British Film Institute, the Brithish Film and Television Producers Association, the Directors Guild of Great Britain and the National Film and Television School. That is a most—I shall not say surprising—impressive array of people who know the industry and care about its future. The document represents an impressive degree of unanimity about what we should seek to achieve in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bring myself into order in mentioning the document by citing the first of the objectives on which those six important bodies have agreed. They say that there must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"An appropriate body to replace the existing National Film Finance Corporation, secured by statute, adequately funded, with a fully representative Board and an independent Chief Executive and Chairman."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
Surely that must carry some weight with the Minister; it carries considerable weight with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Brinton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document is, I believe, unique. I cannot think of an occasion when all branches of the British Film industry have got together before. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will bear that in mind when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The document is not just another piece of special pleading from one interest group in the industry. It is as near as we could get to a clear statement from the industry as a whole about what it wants. It is not simply to be thrown aside or tossed into the waste paper basket. It is a considered statement, clearly resulting from substantial discussions between bodies which, because they have different roles in the industry, do not always see eye to eye. One would not expect them to. Yet here is the clearest possible statement from the industry as a whole about what it sees as essential if something is to replace the NFFC. I go no further now than the first objective, but I hope that the Minister will also consider the other six objectives listed in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are driven to the conclusion that for the moment, despite the Minister's best intentions and many assurances—for which we are grateful, and to which we shall hold him—we do not yet have in the Bill the statutory securing of those objectives that the industry believes important. We support the industry in that belief. I hope that the Minister will now move a step further, so that we can not only accept his good intentions but see a means whereby those intentions can be put into effect. At present the means are not as clear as they should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two main worries on Second Reading were those of finance and administration. We are now looking at the other side of the same coin. If we are genuinely concerned about the future and the viability of a native film industry, it seems a trifle silly to give it more money and not to look closely at what it will do and how it will do it. It is only logically consistent, therefore, to toughen up both parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general arguments about the package of amendments were amply dealt with at our two earlier sittings, but as some of the amendments stand in my name, it seems reasonable for me to say a few brief words. The amendments set out to do three important things. First, they seek to provide some details about the composition of the new body. We know from our last sitting that the chief executive will be appointed by the Government, but it seems desirable, as amendment No. 13 proposes, that at least some of the directors should represent the film procedures directly. Secondly, they seek to provide some guarantee for the creative nature of the new body, so that it fulfils the necessary objective of encouraging new film makers without whom, of course, we would not have a film industry. Thirdly, they seek to provide more detail about the relationship between the new body and the Secretary of State—for instance, that the chief executive has sole creative authority within the financial framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
In my view, it is sensible to encourage new film makers, even beyond the support that has been announced for the film school. That is what the NFFC did. As far as I can see from the Bill as drafted, it does not appear that the new body will have that as a priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we pass the Bill, we want to be more sure about what we are creating. We must ensure the independence of the new body and be sure of the direction that we want it to have. If we saw fit to provide more funds and recycled money—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I did not hear his precise words. I hope that he will forgive me therefore if I have misunderstood him. I think we all agree that the encouragement of new film makers is an important objective. My hon. Friend the Minister said at our last sitting, in relation to amendment No. 14, which sought
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make the encouragement of new film makers the main objective of the company. I agree that that is extremely important. There has been universal praise of the NFFC for what it has done in that area. As I have already told the Committee, in our discussions with the proposed participants in 'son' both we and they were in complete agreement on the important objective of encouraging the emergency of new film makers." —[
	<i>Official Reort, Standing Committee B,</i> 13 December 1984; c. 168.]</p></blockquote>
When my hon. Friend said that, it seemed to me that he met the Committee's fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is no good meeting the Committee's fears unless a procedure and financial structure is set up to obtain those ends? That was my argument. It is all very well having weasel words from the Minister, saying, "Leave it to me. Things may be all right.", without setting out the procedure for how it will come all right and saying whence the money will come to make it so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we see fit to provide more funds and recycled money, which is surely a recognition of the uncommercial nature of much film making, in the strict sense, it must be right to provide some cultural guarantees. The amendments are framed in a spirit of doing the best for the industry, in an endeavour to enable it to foster talent and let it know where it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was impressed—as, no doubt, were all members of the Committee—by this new Diet of Worms, this concord, this solemn Pinewood-Elstree binding, in which the most astonishing names are in close juxtaposition. I can say only to the Minister that if those eminent men have got it right, it would appear that he has not got it right. Perhaps he will think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has ranged over a wide number of matters and we have raised several issues with the Minister. I, for my part, have listened carefully to what he said. I hope that he has taken note of our arguments in the spirit in which we made them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the commercial problem—to put it that way—which the Minister faces. None of us knows the full details of the contract yet, because not even the Minister knows them. I suggest to the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) that perhaps we should let the matter rest here and not push it to a vote at this
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
stage. We could then see, in the weeks ahead, how the contract develops. It is not often that an Opposition Member supports a Minister, but the Minister said that the details would be made known to us on Report. If, by then, we are not satisfied, those of us interested in the matter can bring it back to the Floor of the House. I therefore suggest that line of action to the hon. Member for Hendon, North and my hon. Friends so that we can then debate other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) for his intervention. I said that on Report I would give as much detail as I could in response to the kind of questions which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may not have concluded our agreement with the partners in the son of NFFC-I should have said participants and not partners; I was picking up the vocabulary that has been used. I shall seek to outline our aims and to build into those objectives one or two of the points which have been raised in Committee. The concerns expressed are absolutely legitimate and I shall make as full a statement as I can on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is most extraordinary that I should receive Whipping instructions from the Opposition. Perhaps my own Whip will find that helpful!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the astonishment at the document which was made available to all Committee members—which informs us of the extraordinary conversion of the film industry into one unit—and especially at the first recommendation, which has a bearing on this group of amendments. However, my hon. Friend the Minister has been forthcoming, expansive and informative since I made several interventions at the end of the previous sitting. It would, therefore, be ungenerous not to recognise his helpfulness. I appreciate his undertakings in response to my later interventions, and I am happy to leave matters until we are given the details which he promised in col. 184—specifically that he would have in mind the contract between himself and the prospective partners in the son of NFFC and also that he would consider writing into the Bill whether he could recover money from some of the partners if he felt that the conditions had not been met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be "into the contract". The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) used the phrase "the Bill" and I corrected him later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that correction. Having heard those assurances, I am happy with the advice of my hon. Friend the Minister not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share with other Committee Members their welcome for the Minister's assurances, especially those given in the previous sitting. The Hansard record of that debate will be of immense value to those who wish to know what is likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it remains of cardinal importance that as much as possible should be out in the open and on the record. I understand that negotiations are about to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
take place, are in progress or about to be concluded. I hope that as much as possible of such negotiations, exchanges of letters, and so on, will be published or at least made available so that we can see the conditions which are proposed and accepted on either side. I hope also that the contract will be spelt out in great detail before we are invited, on Report, finally to accept any form which clause 3 might take. I urge to the Minister to be as clear as possible on those points. The Opposition still feel that what counts is not so much the Minister's assurances or the short-term deals that he makes with commercial companies, but that something should be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been as flexible and helpful as we can in our suggestions that might meet that point. Something should be written into the Bill to give us a lever over the future development of the undertaking. Without that, the successor to the NFFC will fly away from us and there will be no further possibility of our intervening to make sure that it is doing what we all believe to be necessary in the interests of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am content to accept the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) to join ranks with the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). While we do not wish to press the matter to a vote, we should be interested to hear on Report the outcome of the Minister's negotiations and to hear in detail the form of the agreement. We still urge the Minister to provide something in the Bill to guarantee the future of the film industry. On condition that we reserve the right to return to this matter on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 4, line 17, leave out from 'which' to `the' in line 18 and insert 'satisfies'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As will be apparent, the amendment is designed to probe and to suggest a means of tightening up clause 3. Clause 3 refers to the concept of a "relevant film". The definition of a relevant film relates to the whole definition in schedule 1. Given the flexibility of the definition of British film, it is not immediately apparent why a relevant film should not be a British film.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present drafting provides two elements of additional flexibility. It is not clear why they should be there. First, it provides that it is not a question of objective fact whether a film meets a certain definition, but states that it should be intended to satisfy. That is difficult to prove because then it is a matter of subjective intention. It is hard to see why we should abandon a perfectly clear objective test in favour of a matter of intention. Anyone could say that he intended to meet the definition, but that his intention failed to manifest itself in practice. Secondly, there is the further provision. Even given the immense flexibility in the requirement of intention only, the clause then says that the film need not meet the requirement at all and need only do so:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or to a substantial extent".</p></blockquote>
What does a substantial extent mean? Is it a little more than half? the provision injects an unnecessary element of uncertainty and laxity. The definition should mean something. There is little point in limiting the clause to
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
"relevant film" if the concept of a relevant film is deprived of all substantial meaning by these widely-drawn provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reply to those two points and assure us that the purpose of the drafting is not to enable the successor to the NFFC to escape any such constraints but is intended to have a real limitation on the films that will qualify under clause 3. I also hope that the Minister will explain why it is necessary to inject those additional elements of uncertainty into what looks to be a straightforward definition of a British film.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to add a few comments to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a British film in schedule 1, to which this part of clause 3 refers, is broad and loose. I appreciated the Minister's comments at our last sitting when he touched on the problem of the definition of a British film. Nonetheless, it seems odd that in addition to schedule 1 allowing a wide definition, two extra qualifications are included relating to intention and to the possibility of a substantial rather than an entire extant being allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies to the debate will he tell us why he feels that the breadth of definition in schedule 1 is insufficient to give the flexibility required to ensure that a film will qualify as a British film in law, even when all common sense says that it is a British film but there may be technical reasons why it might fall foul of the British qualification? Will he tell us why additional qualifications are needed beyond those already in the schedule, to which the clause refers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. At the last Committee sitting I raised the question of "relevant" films and said, "whatever they are". The Minister replied at that time that it was quite clearly defined in the legislation. It is because Conservative Members do not feel that it is clearly defined in the legislation that they have some hesitation about the clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton)—I am intervening because he is absent—intends to raise in later amendments the subject of relevance under the schedule. I think it might be helpful, while both Ministers are here, if we touch on that now and receive some indication as to whether the amendments which my hon. Friend has tabled will be accepted because they do have a bearing on this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We can only have comments like that in a single word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (Mr. Trippier): I am anxious to reply to this debate. I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) made it clear to the Committee that this was essentially a probing amendment. Having listened to the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) I do not think that there is much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
difference between us on that point. There is nothing sinister behind this part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must oppose the amendment, not for any dogmatic reason of allowing the successor company to the NFFC a measure of freedom to produce large numbers of foreign films, but for simple, practical reasons. A degree of flexibility is built into the clause and I shall endeavour to explain to the Committee why that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are mistaken if they believe that the film which is finally assembled is exactly the same as the script and shooting schedule upon which the production first started. Producers' and directors' lives are bedevilled by hundreds of problems along the way. Stars, supporting artistes, and extras can fall ill or leave the project and need replacing; a location shot can be ruined by some unforeseen event; new shots and scenes must be added as the production work continues. All along, the intention may be to make a qualifying British film, but films can be seriously impaired by the loss of certain scenes and if the only substitute is to use some different location or personnel to make new scenes to save the film, the film maker will have no option but to use what facilities he finds available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the argument, and I apologise if I have interrupted the Minister before he had completed it. However, does he not recognise that the exceptional unforeseeable circumstances that he describes are fully provided for in schedule 1, paragraph 7(3)? What purpose, other than to provide for such circumstances, could there be for that subparagraph? Is he not therefore over-egging the pudding by writing into clause 3 yet further possibilities for people to escape from the definition of a British film?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. It is important to introduce the degree of flexibility to which I referred earlier. The hon. Gentleman's point is closely linked to the question that he asked in his substantive speech to the Committee. It is a fair point, and I intend to deal with it fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I maintain that the problem that I have outlined is a potential problem which faces all film makers, including those at present supported by NFFC finance. But to set out with the intention to make a British film, and then to be held by statutory conditions, regardless of any circumstances or problems that may arise, to every aspect of the certification rules on labour content and so on would impose an intolerable burden upon film makers. I do not believe that Opposition Members intended that, but nevertheless that would be the effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) asked about the use of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or to a substantial extent".</p></blockquote>
They are included to take account of the power of the Secretary of State in paragraph 7(3) of schedule 1 to alter the determination of labour costs to the film producer's advantage if he is satisfied that the film producer took all reasonable steps to meet the
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
conditions in the schedule and only failed to meet them because of exceptional circumstances beyond his control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that during the previous sitting my hon. Friend the Minister of State cited the film "Zulu" as an example. It was a good example, and I cite it again here. The appropriate factor will be determined by the Department of Trade and Industry, where the power for the certification of films lies. I hope that after that explanation the hon. Member for Dagenham will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division. However, could he say a little more? At the end of his argument he seemed to be making my point rather than his—but perhaps I misunderstood him. Surely if clause 3 simply said something such as "A relevant film shall be a British film as defined in schedule 1", that definition would include the element of flexibility provided in schedule 1 paragraph 7(3). Paragraph 7(3) provides for that element of flexibility within defined limits and for precise purposes, but it is adequately drawn to meet the unforeseeable nature of film making. However, I cannot understand why it is necessary that the definition of "relevant" in clause 3 seeks to provide a totally unrestricted element of laxity and uncertainty. Why can we not rely on the provision in the schedule rather than on this widely-drawn provision in clause 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 1(4) is extremely tightly drawn. There is a need for some flexibility to meet the points to which I referred earlier. The reason why it is necessary to be satisfied that the son of NFFC will assist in the production of films which are intended to be British, is that it is impossible to know whether a film is British until after it has been completed and certified by the Department of Trade and Industry as a British film. We can only tell whether a film is a British film once it has been completed, and not at the time when finance has been made available from son of NFFC. It is necessary to refer in the Bill to films intended to be British rather than to films which are British.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the amount of public money, if any, which is to be made available, not just to the successor of the NFFC, but to the film industry generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause stands, the power provided to the Secretary of State is purely permissive. There is no guarantee that any money will find its way to the successor company or to any other institution in the film industry. The amendments seek to ensure that an adequate sum of money is paid to the successor body and to other bodies that could make good use of that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 touches on a point which should command widespread support. It proposes that any decision that the Secretary of State might take on these issues should be his own decision. Such a decision should be taken only in the interests of the film industry. The amendment provides that the heavy hand of the Treasury is removed from the Secretary of State when he makes such decisions. I am sure that every Minister in Whitehall wishes to have that heavy hand removed. But no doubt, Treasury Ministers are equally determined to make sure that it remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to resist his friends in the Treasury and to tell them that it is a relatively small matter in the overall management of the country's economy and a matter of precise and definite interest to the film industry. That should be the sole and most important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are reinforced in our view that the Treasury should have little to do with this issue when one considers what has happened to the film industry over the past couple of years. It is common knowledge that the renaissance enjoyed by the British film industry recently has been almost entirely due to the regime of capital allowances provided by the Treasury. In this instance, I am happy to express gratitude and respect to the Treasury for that concession, but the industry is painfully aware of the fact that what the Treasury gives the Treasury can take away, in breach of clear undertakings given by Ministers to the industry. In other words, there is an unfortunate precedent which gives the industry little confidence in what the Minister says, or even in permissive provisions in legislation, if the Treasury decides the issue in the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Hanley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond and Barnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may recall that at our last sitting I asked my hon. Friend the Minister whether he could assure us that the Government intended to continue to give support to British films if the new body failed. He declined to answer—clearly, quite rightly, as it was the wrong time to reply. I merely express the fear which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
expressed in the earlier debate and which was not answered on that occasion. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can tell me why this provision is here at all, if the Department of Trade and Industry does not intend to fight its corner against the Treasury over support for British films, if the new NFFC fails to take off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman is right to ask about a situation that might arise if the successor company folds up after, say, three years, which is surely quite possible. We have had no assurances or guarantees on that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will pursue the issue with the Minister, because it is extremely important. So far, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, we have had no ministerial reply to his question. On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I fear that the clause is drawn in this way simply to take account of the natural caution that Ministers have in these matters and the natural deference to the Treasury that seems to afflict Ministers in the Department. I have tabled the amendment in an endeavour to encourage Ministers to overcome that inhibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could get away from what I describe as the dead hand of the Treasury, and get rid of this provision, there might be a slightly better chance—certainly, the industry would feel more confident about that better chance—of placing the financial assistance to the industry on a secure basis which could not be undermined at any moment by one of the endless succession of cuts with which we have become all too familiar in recent years. Bearing in mind the industry's unhappy experience over capital allowances and the breach of the clear ministerial undertaking, which plunged the industry into such difficulties, I well understand why anyone who is familiar with that history, on reading the words in the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>'.with the consent of the Treasury",</p></blockquote>
will say, "Well, that is that. We can dismiss the provision because at any moment the Treasury will go back on any assurance that the Minister has given." However, the clause is there; the oddity is that it is drawn in purely permissive terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the second purpose of the amendments, that not only should the Minister provide public money, irrespective of whether he gets Treasury approval, but that that public money should be of a certain minimum value. Various amendments specify different sums and different ways of calculating how the sum should be arrived at. The amendments bring into question the amount of public money that is at present devoted to the film industry and the amount that the Government intend to provide for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State concluded his speech with a series of slightly odd calculations about the immense sums of money which, in his view, were being made available to the industry. He reached a grand total of f50-odd million. When we looked—in a somewhat startled way—at the way in which he had reached that total, it became clear that he had counted in all the sums paid by independent television companies for the maintenance of Channel 4. I think that it would be reasonable for the Minister to concede that it is neither
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
appropriate nor fair to take the £45 million as money that is made available to the British film industry. But I am sure that he will wish to comment on that point when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real amounts of money that are available to the industry are very much less. Moreover, they must be considered in the context of the effective removal of capital allowances. We must not forget that the context in which our debates are taking place is one in which the main financial and tax incentive—the sole and most effective measure to have promoted film production in recent years, is about to be terminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has rightly frequently drawn attention to the inadequacy of the money produced for the film industry through the Eady levy. I believe that we all accept that the Eady levy had become inadequate to fulfil its true purpose. However, surely the £1.5 million, which everyone concedes is inadequate, provides a benchmark by which to measure what the Government now intend to provide. The Government say that they will provide £1.5 million directly to the successor company and £0.5 million to the national film development fund. However, those are marginal improvements on a total amount that universally is conceded to be inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must all hope and expect that the amendment that we have succeeded in getting through the Committee will remain in the Bill, when some of the problems will be eased by an effective distributive mechanism. However, I am a little anxious about press reports which claim that that is not the Government's intention. If the Government were to go back on the Committee's decision on the redistributive mechanism, the question of what money the Government intend to provide would be brought into even greater focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one amendment we propose the relatively modest amount of £5 million a year. If that is considered excessive, the next stage of the argument can be brought into play. We should study what other countries do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman comment on the contention that the only way in which higher investment can be obtained in the British film industry from other sources, such as the City of London, is if there is an adequate fund? All the reports that I have read quote a figure of about £20 million as the seedbed, as it were, that would attract the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I believe that the ACTT, for example, has conducted the exercise. It has talked to people in the City and asked them what they would require. The hon. Gentleman has fairly represented the replies that were obtained from that exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the amount of money made available is of vital importance—I hope that I will carry him with me on this—it is also true that the psychological effect of a reasonably serious Government commitment would also be to have some impact in the City. If the City sees that the Government believe that the industry has
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
afuture and that it is worth putting money into it, I believe that the City will conclude that there is a general view in Government that the film industry has a future, that it will survive and that it is worth sustaining. Such investment would help to create a climate in which money would be forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear that of course the Opposition realise the immense role to be played by private investment capital in the industry. There is no question about that. However, our wish is to ensure that conditions exist that will bring forward that capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if there is sufficient seedcorn financing—the funds need not be substantial that in itself provides the very incentive needed by the City? The initial investment will be made by the son of NFFC, but it needs enough finance at the start to make the City realise that the Government are determined that the industry shall succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has reinforced the duality of the importance of the financial commitment, and the Government's commitment to help in the industry's future. We should pay tribute to the ACTT which has recognised the importance of involvement in the City. It asked people in the City what they thought was required, and the answers were extremely useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are discussing the appropriate levels of Government assistance to the industry, it is relevant to consider what other countries do in that aspect. I do not propose to weary the Committee with a long recitation of all the aids and incentives provided by other countries. I hope that many Committee members will have had access to an excellent document produced by the Cinematograph Films Council. It provides a most comprehensive review of the regimes which apply in an enormous range of countries. Virtually every country either has a film industry or aspires to having a film industry. Without exception, they all provide financial assistance to it. Anyone who cares to dip into that document will see a bewildering range of tax and other financial incentives, redistributive mechansims, grants, loans and subsidies provided by public funds. It shows that Governments in all those countries recognise the cultural significance of a film industry. They do not allow it to languish if it fails in the market place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take account of that comparative experience. It is difficult for him or anyone else to argue that everyone else is out of step but us. It is universally accepted that it is worth making a commitment to the film industry. It is hard to argue that we alone are exempt from that requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister finds himself in some slight difficulty, because the Government have not yet fully made up their minds as to whether to argue that their proposals in the way of public help are sufficient. On the other hand, the Minister may be inclined to say that an element of subsidy will not be offered. Indeed, I am reminded that the industry is apparently debilitated by subsidy. The Minister has to say whether he holds that view. However, if he believes that some subsidy is justified, we can discuss how much is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course my hon. Friend the Minister will reply to that. But I suggest that while the Minister is willing, the Department is weak in its relations with the Treasury. The Treasury is the problem—we need to persuade the Treasury rather than the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on one of the main problems. I hope that the Minister will defend his departmental interests rather than play a minuscule part in some wider economic stragegy with which the film industry is not directly concerned. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman, if he cares to intervene at a later stage, will reinforce my view that we need a clear statement from the Minister that he first recognises the need for public and governmental support for the industry and, secondly, recognises his role in defending that commitment to the industry against the pretentious of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that tension with the Treasury is a constant preoccupation with Ministers. That is true of the Minister's Government and as well as of others. Therefore, I am not suggesting that he has a unique responsibility but, nevertheless, it is true to say that some of the most successful Ministers in Whitehall are those who fight their corners most strongly against the Treasury. Therefore, I urge the Minister to follow that useful precedent. Will the Minister give us his view on the element of public commitment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by drawing attention again to a statement which impressed the Committee, and that came from six bodies within the film industry. It identified a number of points which they regarded as vital to the future of the industry. They pointed out the importance of a redistributive mechanism—which was the subject of an earlier debate—of the reestablishment of fiscal incentives for film production, and of the need for adequate funding. There is no question of what those bodies meant by adequate funding. It is that in one way or another the film industry should have the year by year provision of enough money, as the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) pointed out, to give the City confidence that this is an industry in which it is worth investing. Unless it has that confidence the film industry will not survive in the form in which we wish to see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely want to add my voice to that of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), as I believe in the spirit of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not talk about numbers. We cannot say how much money is needed or how much we are short of. That depends on the circumstances of the case when and if the new body fails. However, we all hope that it will not do so. But I believe that we require today a clear statement from the Minister of the Government's intentions with regard to their support of the film industry in the future. I seek both financial and spiritual support today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interest in the Bill has shown the Minister and our right hon. and hon. Friends that the film industry is not something that can be slipped through using a small Bill once every five or 10 years. The legislation has gripped the imagination of the public and, in particular of the industry, and many disparate bodies are now united in a way that we have not seen for years. Therefore, I ask the Government to give a clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
statement about their support for the film industry, not only for the sake of the industry but for the sake of those who enjoy the product of that industry. Mine is not a straightforward plea to support only those who are engaged in the industry. It also involves those who benefit. When arguing his corner with the Treasury, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will remind it that in one fell swoop in this parliamentary session £300 million has been saved. Therefore, a small contribution to the film industry, which creates a product with a permanent cultural benefit for the country, can be seen as small beer compared with the many great savings that have been found in other areas. Therefore, I ask my Hon. Friend for that support, which would mean so much to so many people for so little cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could take this batch of amendments logically. If only two of them were accepted it would show the Department's determination to support the film industry. That takes us to base one. One could make all sorts of cracks about the Treasury. That amorphous body that seems to poke its nose into everything and spoil everything for everyone else should just occasionally get that little nose punched. After all, what is 5 million quid? It is the price of a couple of tanks. We are not talking about vast sums. Can the Ministers in the Department not stand up to the Treasury over the price of a couple of tanks? Films would be of much greater propaganda value to us than a couple of tanks, which would be stuck in barracks and have their guns polished from time to time—or someone may fire the guns occasionally, and that is another 30,000 quid gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about a great deal of money. If the Minister cannot stand up to the Treasury for such a small amount, there is not much hope for the rest of us. Why do we need the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Treasury"?</p></blockquote>
What has the Treasury got to do with whether the Department backs the film industry? If the Department intends to back the industry, let it have the courage of its corner, and stand up and say, "We shall back it". Does the Minister mean that that backing will depend on whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer says, "You have been a good boy in the rest of your Department; you can have your film industry support for this year"? That is not good enough. Perhaps the Government feel that this is only for the short term—say, three to five years—and then, or if it flops, they will think of something different. That is no good, and inspires no confidence. I cannot see why the Minister will not accept the amendment. No doubt the Department had discussions with the Treasury before the Bill came to the Floor of the House. No doubt the Treasury said that the Department could invest in the film industry—at least, I hope that it did. The Treasury always forgets that one reaps only what one sows. The Treasury is good at scavenging across the countryside devastating everything in sight to glean pennies for its coffers. However, unless the Treasury and the Minister understand that only by sowing the seeds of investment shall we reap the product of films and a film industry, the industry will be in a sorry state in the future.

	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Treasury"</p></blockquote>
so that we can all have a little more confidence in the future of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to amendment No. 20, which would turn the word "may" into the word "shall". I could refer the Committee to the arguments about the same substitution in the Committee stages of the Cable and Broadcasting Act, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, and other Acts. Civil servants always like to use the word "may", because it is a get-out. They do not have to do anything if they use that word. I see the civil servants nodding their heads sagely; perhaps that makes my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "shall" is definitive. Lord Denning has been heard to argue at great length both in the other place as Master of the Rolls in the Court of Appeal about the definitive meaning of the word "shall". It means "you will do something". The present wording of the Bill, using the word "may", means, "You need do nothing." The amendment would further strengthen the Bill. If there were no British company to which the monies could be applied, we should all have to think again. However, there are several British companies and, indeed, there will be the son of NFFC. However, I shall not go back to the arguments heard on clause 3. The sum of £5 million is not very large in real terms if we consider how much the Government spend in any one year on other matters. Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 set a target—to put it that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The target of,
	<br><blockquote><p>"12 feature films and six short films annually"</p></blockquote>
is not very big. In their White Paper, the Government took pride in the fact that 33 films were being made, if my memory serves me correctly. That was supposed to be the renaissance of a British film industry. All that can be said—almost cynically—is that we are not asking for much with 12 and six films. However, they provide a definitive target, and that is no bad thing. Personally speaking, I should like the targets to be higher than 12 and six, but I must not be too greedy in asking for a piece of the cake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of amendments does not ask much—merely that the Minister will do something so that he will not be left with a clause which enables him to do nothing. It asks that the Treasury can be quietly told by the Department that the Bill is positive and shows that the Government have confidence in the film industry and intend to do something about it. The other amendments speak of small and perhaps paltry sums, but with a minimal target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how the Government can fail to accept the amendments. I am not expressing a pious hope. I merely say that the Minister and his colleaues have told us time and again that they have great confidence in the film industry and intend to support it. Now through the amendments, the Opposition simply ask the Minister to put his money where his comments have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I cannot withdraw that remark. Only this morning I read in the newspapers the decision of the Minister for the Arts about funding for the British Film Institute for the coming year, and the severe difficulties for certain aspects of its work that that will pose. I am sure that behind the noble Lord's decision—he is undoubtedly sympathetic—we shall find the requirements of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequeur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the kernal of the amendments is to seek to stregthen the Minister's arm. We are seeking to put into legislation requirements which will enable the Minister to do what he wishes and will give him a legislative argument against the predatory ravages of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor. The major point of the amendments is probably best made in the joint industry statement that has been quoted extensively this morning, and which bears requoting because it is remarkable and significant. Its first crucial point, about an appropriate body to replace the existing NFFC, is that it should be adequately funded. The point is that there should be adequate funding for the successor body to the NFFC, to enable it to do the job that we all want it to do properly. It is important to specify the minimum funding in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) spoke about tanks. Another useful analogy to the amount specified in amendment No. 23 is the annual cost of this Government supporting fewer than a handful of Falkland islanders. Compared with that, there cannot conceivably by any argument, bearing in mind that what we are asking for is support of the British film industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arguing for proper funding, the Minister will wish to put three major points to his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. First, we have already persuaded the Committee—Conservative members of the Committee succeeded in doing so, and great credit to them—to institute in the Bill the principle of the raising of a levy on the showing of films on television. So the Chancellor cannot complain that funding for the successor body to the NFFC and support for the British film industry will be a drain on the public sector borrowing requirement. It will not be. The means of raising funds from the showing of films is already there, and is now written into the Bill. So the Minister's first argument is that it will not be a drain on the public sector borrowing requirement or, indeed, on the existing public purse, because the means of raising the money is already there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument will be that the original take from the Eady levy in its first year of operation, projected forward to current prices, comes to more than £10 million—that being the amount originally envisaged, in present-day terms, that would be raised by the Eady levy and ploughed back into the film industry. By proposing the amount
	<br><blockquote><p>" of not less than £5 million"</p></blockquote>
in amendment No. 23, we are making an extremely modest demand on the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument that the Minister will wish to make is that the film industry reaps for this country extremely valuable benefits in terms of foreign currency
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
earnings. It is not simply a question of the promotion of culture and talent and the making of good films. It is also a question of the net overseas earnings by United Kingdom film companies which, in 1983, were £93 million. One of the most significant features of 1983 was the dramatic increase in receipts from the north American market. So the Chancellor and his Treasury officials will have no answer when the Minister says, "We want to devote £5 million of money to the promotion of British films, and we have already instituted a means of raising that money." If the Chancellor were than to say, "That is not good value for money, and not worth pursuing," that would be no argument at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We put forward these amendments to assist the Minister. Even with the powers of argument and persuasion that we know the Minister possesses, the heavier weight of the Chancellor in the status ranking of Government officials may mean that the Minister fails to convince his right hon. Friend the Chancellor, in spite of the clear logic of the arguments, of the rightness of his cause. We have a sober reminder of that likelihood in this morning's announcement about the British Film Institute. In these amendments, therefore, we seek to strengthen the Minister's arm. We seek to write into legislation, because even the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not above the law, a requirement on the Government to put minimal adequate funding into the successor body to the NFFC. The Minister should welcome our amendments with open arms so that he can carry out what both sides of the Committee want, and that is the proper funding of the future promotion and production of British films by new talent in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) did about punching the Treasury on the nose. If one takes a close look at my hon. Friend's cheek, it appears that somebody has tried and missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be churlish to deny that the Treasury's hand is much in evidence in the Bill, as it was in the White Paper. I have said before, and everyone in the industry knows, that we had to wait a long time for the White Paper because the Treasury got its hands on it and mangled it. That is why we have this convoluted Bill, which is much weaker than it would have been, had the Minister in charge of the Bill at the time had his way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the chance for the Under-Secretary of State to shine. I can honestly say that I have done it. In this very Committee Room, the morning after the 1979 election was announced, sitting there as the Minister, I defied the Treasury. It is true, of course, that I did not come back as the Minister, but neither did the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. So we were equal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Minister for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) listed the countries that were engaged in the film industry and said-1 think it is true, without exception—that they give more per capita than we do, it is important to remember that they would love to
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
have the know-how and expertise of our producers, directors, technicians and actors. The Minister should grasp that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may not have been bored with it, Sir John, but perhaps your predecessor in the Chair was bored with the word "renaissance". We have heard it from Ministers. We have also been told that it is a delicate industry. So we have a delicate renaissance. I do not know whether that has ever been heard of before. However, I stress the renaissance, because it is a possibility. If amendment No. 18, in particular, is accepted, then without the Treasury's involvement, we have a chance to build on this industry in a positive manner. So in the absence of the Minister of State, perhaps this is the time for the Under-Secretary of State to grasp his opportunity, to defy the Treasury, and to show the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I address my remarks, as is proper, to you, Sir John, but I hope that one of my two Whips will be listening, because I find the amendments unacceptable. In my view, it is right to keep the Treasury in the picture, because it has to cough up a good deal more money. Therefore, I am not in favour of amendment No. 18. I have a neutral attitude to the "may" or "shall" argument because I believe it to be largely irrelevant. However, I find myself parting company with the Opposition on the question of not less than £5 million. They have set their sights too low. The last of the amendments deals with the production of at least 12 feature films and no fewer than six short films annually. My hon. Friend the Minister has already given an undertaking that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The intention is that initially 'son' should aim to part-fund 10 feature films a year".[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B, 13 December 1984; C. 165.</i>]</p></blockquote>
To part-fund 10 feature films a year is a tiny contribution. It will be evident early that that is inadequate. That is why I want the Treasury kept in the picture. It will have to cough up more money and there will be no argument about that later whatever argument there may be now.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an amazing debate. The ears of Treasury Ministers must be burning this morning, as some emotive and dramatic terminology has been banded about. There have been phrases such as, "Punch the Treasury on the nose" and "The Treasury has mangled it". We have heard about the "heavy hand" and the "dead hand" of the Treasury. Hon. Members have said that they have a profound distrust of the Treasury. Perhaps the most emotive phrase was the "predatory ravages" of the Treasury. I wish to take the opportunity provided by the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry) to redress the balance. Hon. Members are wrong. The Treasury is a fine body—that might do my future career a darn sight more good than taking the advice of the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it was kind of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to pay tribute to the Treasury. It has been forgotten that it is due to the Treasury that the business expansion scheme was extended to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
incorporate the British film industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) said that he wanted a clear statement from me that the Government were committed to supporting the film industry. But we have said that time and time again. I passionately believe in that. Not only should we support the industry financially but spiritually, as he suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments refer to the discretionary powers of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and also to the giving of assistance and the amounts of such assistance. I understand the concern of all hon. Members that there should be no doubt whatsoever that finance will be available for project development and for the son of NFFC, and that the amount should be sufficient to achieve its purpose. I repeat what the Government have stated both in the White Paper and on Second Reading. We intend to give substantial and continuing support towards project development work and the son of NFFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to contribute £1.5 million to the son each year for five years under clause 4(1)(a). We envisage that the son will be the agent appointed under clause 4(3) to operate the film project development scheme, which will have available £500,000 a year under clause 4(1)(b). In addition, the participants in the son will contribute £1.1 million a year. These externally generated funds amount to more than twice the external funding which has been available to NFFC to do the same work. Moreover, we intend to make available to the son the NFFC's portfolio of rights and interests in about 800 films made since the late 1940s. That is expected to yield an income of £200,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was a little unfair to my right hon. Friend Lord Gowrie about the announcement that he made yesterday. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The total provision for the British film institute will represent a 43/4 per cent. increase … for the National Film and Television School, a 13 per cent. increase, including in each case additional sums for special needs".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that that will be welcomed by all members of the Committee and the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has just put great weight on the word "substantial" funding. In the light of what he has heard in Committee about the needs of the British film industry, can he really say that what he has outlined in detail—which amounts to a charitable £4 million a year—is adequate? Does he not recognise that the business expansion scheme is, as presently constituted, not suitable for helping film producers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall that we have discussed this in the past. I did not agree with him then, and I do not agree with him now. I maintain that Committee Members have underplayed the importance and significance of the business expansion scheme. I do not accept what is in the document. I maintain that if greater flexibility was needed in the business expansion scheme, a constructive case could be made. But it is up to hon. Members to do so. If that case is brought to me, I shall consider it seriously as a Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry with special responsibilities for the business expansion scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
Amendment No. 18 seeks to ensure that the prior consent of the Treasury would not be required before any financial assistance was given by the Secretary of State to the NFFC's successor company or under the project development scheme. I find that proposal rather surprising. As hon. Members will be aware, it is an accepted convention that when the Secretary of State has discretionary power to give financial assistance, he must obtain the consent of the Treasury before exercising that power. The purpose of that requirement is simple. It is that the Treasury will be enabled to act as the watchdog of Parliament to ensure that the intentions of Ministers, as expressed to Parliament, are observed when those discretionary powers are used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also, of course, the practical consideration that the Supply Estimates, through which these sums are provided, have to be presented to Parliament and signed by a Treasury Minister. He would be unlikely to provide his signature if he were not generally content with the way in which those discretionary powers were being used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the National Film Finance Corporation Act 1981, we see that that principle is reflected in section 4(1), which states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation shall have power, with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury, to borrow such sums as the Corporation may require for performing their functions".</p></blockquote>
If it is thought desirable that the principle of enabling the Treasury to protect the wishes of Parliament is preserved, I should have thought that the Opposition would consider it doubly desirable that it should also be preserved in the context of the private successor to the NFFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point about section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. However, will he agree that there is a subtle distinction between the public body with powers to borrow that comes under the 1981 Act and the body which we are now discussing, to which money will or can be given by the Minister from his departmental budget? There is a world of difference between the two. The amendment was tabled because of that difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do how Government in this country works. We all know about the role played by the Treasury in Government and that there are always competing demands for limited resources. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) about it being up to Ministers within the Department of Trade and Industry to fight their corner with the Treasury for their priorities within their departmental budget. That is how it works. I am sure that I am not the only hon. Member who has read the now famous book that was written by Lord Barnett of Heywood and Royton—"Inside the Treasury". There is no secret about the Treasury's role. Nor is a precedent set in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 20 intends to remove the Secretary of State's discretion to give financial assistance to a successor to the NFFC or to someone involved in preproduction work and, instead, to require the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
of State to give such financial assistance. I assume that amendment No. 20 was proposed by Opposition Members because, although they do not distrust the Department of Trade and Industry, they perhaps distrust the Treasury and fear that the Government might go back on their stated intention to give significant financial assistance both to son of NFFC and to the development of film projects. I reassure the Committee that that fear is without foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might have been connected with the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the amendment would require the Secretary of State to give financial assistance to any potential successor to the NFFC. Moreover, in the White Paper and on Second Reading, the Government described their plans for how the son of NFFC should be constituted. We consider that the son that we have identified represents an effective nucleus with significant potential for growth. If we pursued the amendment to its logical conclusion, we might find that we had a plethora of children of NFFC, all of whom might have a legitimate claim on the funds available. I doubt whether any hon. Member would regard that as desirable or acceptable. However, it is right that a "brother" could be assisted if the son were to fail to satisfy the conditions laid down in clause 3, which is extremely unlikely. As now drafted, the Bill provides a safeguard if such an unlikely circumstance occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my hon. Friend to the time when the Government were making up their mind about the right amount of money to make available to the film industry. As I understand it, my hon. Friend said that the business expansion scheme was one element in the Government's thinking. Can my hon.

Furthermore, if no money has come from that source, what grounds has my hon. Friend for supposing that it will?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but my hon. Friend is incorrect.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So no films have been funded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this early stage, as far as I am aware, no films have been supported through those funds. However, several funds have been brought to the attention of the Department of Trade and Industry. They must be brought to the Department's attention under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958, and approved by us. There is considerable interest. I do not need to remind my hon. Friend that the Britishf
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
film industry heavily lobbied my right hon. Friend for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) so that the business expansion scheme could be extended to incorporate the film industry. It is still early days, but I have no doubt that, in view of that heavy lobby, more money will come forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend go further by predicting the sort of amounts that might be made available to the film industry through the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The business expansion schemes that have been set up—the funds—average £2 million. An individual has the right to invest directly in a film or film production, or several people can take advantage of that facility, perhaps by being channelled through a marriage broker, as it were, to bring investors and the target companies together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his autumn statement revealed statistics about the business expansion scheme which were impressive. Certainly they impressed me, because I was unaware how many individuals had taken advantage of the facilities extended by the business expansion scheme and how much money not only had been invested in the funds, but had been invested by the funds in worthwhile projects. Therefore the answer to my hon. Friend's question is that the sky is the limit provided that the fund is approved by us under the Prevention of Fraud (Investment) Act, and by the Inland Revenue, because of the tax advantages. Funds could range from £2 million to £50 million or more. The only bar is that no individual can claim tax on more than f40,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press my hon. Friend, but the point is also important from another aspect. If the Government considered that money would be made available to the film industry by this process, and for a technical or operating reason within the film industry the method was not suitable, presumably, the Government would have made at least a notional saving and could later come forward with another way of funding the film industry if this one did not meet its expectations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to deal with my hon. Friend's detailed points, but he has failed to take into account that benefits under the business expansion scheme, which go to the individuals who invest either directly or through a fund, cause a loss of revenue to the Treasury, because it does not enjoy the source of revenue which it otherwise would have done. That must be taken into account in all calculations about the best scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not try to put a figure on what could be invested in the British film industry through the business expansion scheme. Indeed, it would have been dangerous and highly speculative for us to try to do so. As I have said, however, the potential is enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 seems to seek to impose a minimum amount of financial assistance, namely, £5 million, which the Secretary of State may give to the NFFC's successor or for preproduction projects. Opposition Members have explained the intention
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
behind the amendment, but as drafted it is seriously defective because the wording offers a range of possibilities. It could mean, for example, that a total of not less than £5 million may be given to the NFFC's successor and for pre-production projects. But, if so, over what period is it intended that that obligation should last? I do not believe that Opposition Members—or, indeed, some of my hon. Friends—would be happy with the requirement that over 20 years, say, not less than £5 million of assistance should be given. Alternatively, the amendment as drafted could mean that each recipient of financial assistance should receive at least £5 million, even those who are individual applicants for pre-production assistance. That is how it is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the serious problems with the amendment as drafted, we cannot accept the principle that the flexibility of the Secretary of State should be restricted in that way. I have already described at some length the financial support which the Government intend to provide to son of NFFC and to preproduction projects. If the first interpretation of the amendment is taken, we will be providing more than the £5 million referred to. If the second interpretation is taken, I believe again that the Government's package is better because it provides a steady pattern of assistance and ensures that we do not hand over very large sums at the outset before the company has shown its track record. This flexibility is important and should not be constrained as the amendment proposes. I therefore invite the Committee to reject that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 appears to be intended to provide that financial assistance given by the Secretary of State to the son would have to be at least £1.5 million each year for the next five years. However, as drafted, the amendment could be interpreted to mean that the Secretary of State could impose conditions on such assistance only if it concerned a sum of more than £1.5 million. If he were proposing to make a grant of £1.4 million, for example, he would not be able to attach any conditions to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also raises a point of principle. It is generally accepted that money should be drawn down as and when it is needed. Let us suppose that son .of NFFC gets off to a slow start, perhaps because not enough suitable projects or proposals are immediately forthcoming. It would scarcely be a sensible use of taxpayer's money to pump money into son when nothing was being done with it. But the amendment could have precisely that effect. It could oblige the Secretary of State to pump funds unnecessarily into son. Such an event is by no means impossible and we must preserve the flexibility to respond sensibly to that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I assume that amendment No. 26 is intended to require the Secretary of State to provide enough financial assistance to the son of NFFC to enable the production or co-production of at least 12 feature films and six short films each year. As with amendment No. 25, however, it could be interpreted to mean that unless that requirement is met, the Secretary of State may not impose conditions on the financial assistance he gives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if we consider the more likely purpose of
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
this amendment, I have to say that the Government do not regard it as acceptable. There is no definition of "feature film" or "short film" in the Bill, so there might be difficulties of interpretation. There is also the much more difficult question posed by the words "sufficient funds". Films vary considerably in cost, as I said in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). If one considers also the variation between production and co-production it becomes clear that we could be talking about anything from thousands to many millions of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is no disagreement between us that the NFFC achieved a great deal with its £1.5 million from the Eady levy. The arrangements the Government are making for the new company will substantially increase that annual income. I see no reason to believe that with double the external funds of the NFFC and with the ability to provide crucial "up-front" or "end" money, the new company will not be able to achieve just as much if not considerably more than the widely-acclaimed NFFC.

Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said, he has made great play of the business expansion scheme. The Minister and the participants in the film industry appear to be talking different languages on the subject. The joint statement from the industry has already been quoted extensively. The third measure listed in that document clearly states that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the business expansion scheme is of little or no relevance to the film industry, as indicated in the letter to which many hon. Members have referred, why did the British film industry lobby so heavily to be included in the scheme during the passage of the Finance Bill 1984?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister pre-empted the point that I was about to make. I was about to say that the industry clearly states now, in the joint document, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Business Expansion Scheme is an inadequate instrument for this purpose"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the re-establishment of fiscal incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then ask ourselves, as the Minister asked, why the film industry lobbied to be included in the business expansion scheme. The reason is that a business expansion scheme mechanism properly drafted, with appropriate rules that would apply to the film industry, would be useful. However, the present rules of the scheme are, in the opinion of the industry, not appropriate for the production of films.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the technical deficiencies of the existing business expansion scheme which make it unacceptable to the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the rules, especially the time scale on which the scheme operates, do not synchronise with the time scale for the production of films and the necessary return on that investment. I

	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
hesitate to become involved in a detailed argument about the precise mechanisms of the business expansion scheme. However, from information that I have received from people in the industry it seems clear that the scheme as drawn at present is not appropriate. None the less, there is unanimity in the industry, as presumably there was when it lobbied to be included under the scheme, that something is required to replace the capital allowance system that the Government are phasing out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend, like me, be happier if the Minister gave an assurance that representations from within the film industry about changes that need to be made to the business expansion scheme to make it relevant to that industry would be happily received and given careful consideration by him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be greatly satisfied—and I see that the Minister is about to give us that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would give that assurance to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend. Final decisions on the flexibility of the business expansion scheme, however, rest with the Treasury—that splendid body to which I referred earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with the Minister's commitment, and I hope that the film industry will take up that offer and consult in detail with him about the changes required. However, the Minister's parting comment makes clear the importance of our agreeing amendment No. 18, which would strengthen the Minister's arm 
	<i>vis-á-vis</i> the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freud</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is prepared to re-examine the business expansion scheme in order to make it more acceptable to the film industry, will he also consider the restoration of capital allowances, which would make the situation completely satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will do so, but I suspect that we shall have difficulty in securing such a commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of the recent announcement by the Minister for the Arts. I take up the points made about the British Film Institute and the National Film and Television School. The Office of Arts and Libraries has received an indication that the money going from that office to the school—I do not want to pre-empt future discussions but the Minister did refer to an increase of 13 per cent. in funding—is subject to conditions. Three per cent. of that increase represents an increase below the rate of inflation for the normal functions of the school. The remainder of that increase, £100,000, is a special one-off provision for refurbishment and capital purposes. Therefore, 13 per cent. may sound a major new investment but in reality, while welcome and needed, it may not be as generous as the Minister believes. It is important to make the point that we do not believe that the funding provisions are adequate. However, we do feel that the Treasury has too much influence over the Bill and what it seeks to do. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will press amendment No. 18 to a vote, as it involves an important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is right to describe the debate as disappointing. I pass quickly over the Minister's attachment to the business expansion scheme, which one can well understand. However, although he knows the provisions of the scheme in intimate detail, we might prefer to think that the industry is an authority on its own requirements. It is fair to make the point that the industry lobbied for inclusion in the business expansion scheme because it saw its usefulness to the project development aspect of film work, rather than to the crucial aspect of film production. Will the Minister give that matter his attention if he enters into discussions with the film industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister introduced to the Committee an attractive creature when he described the Treasury as the watchdog of Parliament. I had a vision of a servile creature which barked every now and again in the service of his master, wagged its tail when patted, and so on. But the Minister then described the Treasury as the beast that stalked Whitehall and swept aside all statutory limitations and conditions—legislators could do nothing to stand up to the mammoth power exercised by the Treasury. Therefore, the Minister has failed to convince us as to why he is not concerned to strengthen his arm against the Treasury and as to why he insists that we should write into the Bill a provision which he says applies anyway. Why bring to the light of legislative day the Minister's declared subservience to the Treasury? If the Treasury has to approve every conceivable element of expenditure, why is it necessary to write it into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree, as it is Christmas time, that whereas the Treasury would like to think of itself as Snow White, Cruella D'Evil is probably a better description?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has an appropriate metaphor, as always. But the Minister has yet to explain why this provision must be included in the Bill. I believe that he is placing reliance upon the discretionary nature of the powers provided by the clause. Therefore, I invite the Minister and the Committee to consider the fact that this group of amendments is intended to remove the "dead hand", as I described it, of the Treasury and then to apply a mandatory duty on the Secretary of State to apply a minimum sum of public money to the support of the film industry. That is what the amendments seek to achieve. I fully accept that they contain drafting defects, as do almost all such amendments. If such a mandatory duty were placed on the Minister, he could then congratulate himself and us on having escaped that dead hand of the Treasury. I believe that even the Treasury would not stand in the face of a provision passed by the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At the heart of the debate is the meaning of the provision in clause 4(3) which raised some hope that the Government intended to appoint an independent figure who would fulfil some of the functions which we were extremely anxious to see undertaken by some
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
such person or body. Earlier, we discussed the British films authority and the possibility of amending the Bill to provide for such an institution. We had hoped that any such functions could be undertaken by whoever was appointed under clause 4(3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[SIR JOHN WELLS
	<i> in the Chair.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) had similar thoughts when we debated those amendments earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper, in discussing the role of the national film development fund, makes a specific reference to the person to be appointed under clause 4(3). It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be inappropriate for this to be operated by the Government, and we would envisage having the entire scheme operated by some other organisation acting as the Government's agents."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company to be formed to operate the new fund for assisting British film talent would seem the most appropriate place for this work to be carried out."</p></blockquote>
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear whether the company is regarded as the potential agent, or whether the person to be appointed under clause 4(3) is simply to work within the company, perhaps as its chief executive or some such figure. We should like to know whether clause 4(3) is meant to provide the element of independent appointment that so many members of the Committee have stressed. There is some ambiguity as between the White Paper, the Minister's statement and the clause as drafted, and we hope that the debate will resolve that ambiguity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little doubt that the functions to be undertaken under clause 4(3) could be of considerable importance. They could, if the Government were so minded, extend to many aspects that we regard as important for the future of the industry. I have already mentioned the national film development fund. There is considerable unease that that important body, whose excellent work is recognised in the White Paper, may be subsumed in some way into the commercial operations of the successor company to the NFFC. Opposition Members had hoped that this appointment might involve an element of independent direction of the national film development fund, which would go some way towards meeting anxieties on this score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that the Minister will accept that, whatever functions are envisaged for the person appointed, it is an appropriate means of injecting an element of independence into project development. Perhaps the Minister will consider one or two of the other amendments in the group, which would give this person a major role in the activities of the successor company, under both clause 4(1)(a) and (b). In other words, can we have an appointment of an independent chief executive of the company who will be able to represent the public interest and the interests of the industry in all the activities of the successor company? As drafted, if I understand the somewhat opaque language of the clause and the White Paper, the intention seems to be that the Minister may be satisfied by an appointment of the successor company under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
clause 4(3), with the object of requiring it to undertake the functions identified in clause 4(1)(b). If that is so, Opposition Members—and, I suspect, some Conservative Members—may be disappointed by that interpretation or intention of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of our amendments is that the words of subsection (3) should mean what they appear to say, which is that an independent person should be appointed by the Secretary of State and that that person should have a separate role from—although, no doubt, working closely in conjunction with—the successor company. It should be a separate role, because that person would represent the Secretary of State—and, therefore, the public interest—in the future of the industry, and not simply be a creature of the commercial interests of the successor company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the independent director appointed by the Government would fall into that category, too, or is he relating his remarks only to the chief executive or the chairman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a proper point which I am not competent to answer. I raise these issues with the Minister because, as so often in the Bill, the words do not give us the answers. We do not know—as I had hoped, and partly assumed—whether it is to be the appointment of an independent person, or whether the Minister intends to use this provision to appoint the chairman, the chief executive, the director, or whoever it may be. However, I am sure that the Minister will take the earliest opportunity to resolve our doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The person—to use the legalistic use of the term "person"—that we have in mind is the son of NFFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I feared from the Minister's remarks in the earlier debate. This provision does not give the Minister the power—at least, it gives him the power, but it is not intended—to enable him to make the independent appointment that we had all hoped and assumed that he might make. Yet again, we are being driven back—away from the Bill, which gives us little assistance in this matter—to the assurances that the Minister is giving us, outside the Bill, arising from some negotiations that are yet to be completed. Now that I have adumbrated this important issue, some of my hon. Friends and perhaps other hon. Members may wish to press the Minister further in this respect, because we are now faced with an interpretation of clause 4(3) that is somewhat different from what many of us had assumed. We are disappointed that the person to be appointed is simply our old friend, the as yet to be formed and as yet undisclosed private commercial company on which so many hopes are to be placed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we have now completed the circle of lack of independence? Apparently, the son is to appear under clause 4(3). We were given assurances earlier about how the son was to be created, but we still have no assurances about whether the son will have a single
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
person—a chief executive, an executive director, a Government director, or whoever—who will have the independence of mind, free from commercial pressures, to enable him or her to perform the functions that the industry needs—in other words, someone who will have the authority, first, to cull money from the Government for the purposes of those functions, and secondly, to use that money in a way that is not subjected to commercial pressure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend takes me back to the document that has been mentioned on several occasions this morning. I make no apology for mentioning it again, because the statement issued by the six bodies within the industry is a quite remarkable document. As I said earlier, its first requirement is that the body to replace the NFFC should not only be secured by statute and adequately funded but have a fully representative board and an independent chief executive and chairman. I urge the Minister to think again about the meaning that he intends to attach to clause 4(3) and use it to achieve that objective, which would command widespread support from both the Committee and the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, what the Minister has now told the Committee means that clause 4(3), far from being a bulwark against the commercial interests of the successor company, will strengthen its commercial control over what is at present fulfilling a major and valuable job within the public sector. We now see that clause 4(3) is the means by which the successor company is to take over the full control of the national film development fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tripper</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that at the Committee's previous sitting my hon. Friend the Minister of State referred to that. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is intended that the chief executive should operate with independence, exercising his judgment within the parameters laid down by the partners, very much as the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) suggested."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 13 December 1984; c. 163.]</p></blockquote>
The intervention of the hon. Member for St. Helens, South merely rehearses what he said last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being slightly unfair to my hon. Friend. We are compelled to return again and again to the subject because, as on so many other issues, we are offered, as the Minister fairly pointed out, a ministerial statement that a Minister has in mind the appropriateness and desirability of some of our objectives. When we ask where those intentions will be written into the Bill, we are told that that cannot be done. Hence, throughout the Committee's deliberations there has been unease and anxiety about how we can be sure that the objectives will be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already failed to write into the Bill any obligation resting on the company to pursue the interests of the British film industry. There is no mechanism to assure that objective. There is no assurance that public money is to be paid to the company. Now we are apparently told that even the principle of an independent appointment cannot be written into the Bill. The one provision on which some of us had pinned our hopes is now revealed as not being intended to achieve that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's disquiet. I find it puzzling that under the clause the Minister may give financial assistance to the company, and will seek guidance and perhaps the services of those whom he is consulting. He will then go incestuously—we are talking about families, so it does not matter if I use that emotive word—to the very people who are to receive the money, ask them how things should be done, and then give them the money. That is the reverse of independent. It is incestuous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman states the position well. Far from the provision being the protection that we assumed it might be, it is simply an invitation to the commercial interests to take over yet more of the operations of the former public bodies. That is extremely disquieting. Perhaps the best course would be to listen to the Minister and find out whether he can assuage our difficulties over the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Under-Secretary's intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has transformed the terms of our debate. I had hoped that the advisory person or body instituted under subsection (3) would have an independent role and voice and so would be able to provide Ministers with independent advice, not tied to any company or aspect of the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) raised the possibility at our first sitting. He intervened when my hon. Friend the member for Dagenham was arguing for a potential British film authority and saying that it would be a mechanism for ensuring independence and a wide spread of opinion within the film industry. The hon. Member for Hendon, North said that clause 4(3) could provide the nucleus for such a function. Therefore, it is disappointing that the Under-Secretary says that the person or body that the Government have in mind for fulfilling the roles envisaged under subsection (3) is none other than the son of NFFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All our doubts were expressed during our discussion on the son of NFFC. We discussed its form, the influence that particular interests are likely to have in it and its lack of total independence, even though it would have an independently appointed chief executive. Despite all that, our fears remain about the impartiality of that body and its fitness to perform functions envisaged in subsection (3). It will not be the independent consultative voice providing the Secretary of State and his Ministers with the guidance that they will require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I plead with the Under-Secretary to reconsider the readiness with which he leapt into our discussions to say that the body is likely to be son of NFFC. Surely we need more independence in the guidance provided by subsection (3). We need a clearer definition of how independent that voice will be than the Under-Secretary has so far revealed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brinton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reflecting since I was thunderstruck by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary's statement that the person was to be the son
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
of NFFC. In my naive, non-legalistic way, I thought that a person was an individual. In our earlier sittings, I referred to the importance of the appointment of an independent and powerful chief executive figure. Once again, we are back on the old debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have arranged a marriage between four corporate bodies. That is unusual. The marriage has yet to take place. We are trying to find out the exact terms of the dowry. It is hard to do so until the Minister has completed his negotiations for the dowry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend neglects what I believe to be the present state of the British film production industry as opposed to the British film distributive and exhibiting industry. They are two different things. If we cannot be given an assurance that the rights of the independent producers, who are not attached to any of those bodies represented in son of NFFC, will be catered for in the new institution, we have to press the matter. It is not good enough, if one considers all the people involved in British production, to allow the risk of Rank, Thorn EMI, Channel 4 and the British Videogram Association being able to make decisions without any independent voice being heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention again, with some force, that we cannot run an entertainment industry by committee. That is liable to happen in that set-up. We have to appoint an independent chief executive. We also need a legal requirement on the son of NFFC to allow a percentage of its money—perhaps 10 per cent., but I leave the figure loose—deliberately to go to fostering potentially non-commercially profitable ventures, which will encourage new young film makers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will realise the seriousness of his confirmation that a person has become a body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say hesitatingly to the Under-Secretary that perhaps he should spend the next 48 hours talking to his colleague, the Minister of State. It was made clear to me in what the Minister of State said last Thursday. That was why I was somewhat taken aback when the Minister intervened in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to imply that such matters had been dealt with and that I ought to understand it all. I understood the Minister clearly because, whether or not the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Brinton) was here during the earlier part of the debate, there was considerable pressure from me and other hon. Members for the chief executive to be completely and utterly independent and a human rather than a corporate person appointed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give notice to my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham that I am unhappy with this batch of amendments. I believed that this independent chief executive had two roles. Role one lay with the son of NFFC, and his second role was under clause 4 (1) (b) in order to sponsor, help and assist the independent producer who was not part of the son of NFFC. Therefore, those independent producers would have some means of securing the seed corn finances to which I keep returning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not happy with amendments Nos. 27, 19 or 29. However, I was happy with "may" going to "shall" and would have cheerfully voted for it because we shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
have to appoint a chief executive a human person who will undertake the two roles that I have mentioned. I believe that the drafting of the Bill is a trifle sloppy. It is not strong or clear about the chief executive person to be appointed or that he would have those two definitive roles and be answerable to the Secretary of State and not to commercial interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister told us today, or on Thursday, that he would tidy up the wording so that this chief executive human being had, as the Minister said on Thursday, those two totally clear and defined roles, I should go to the Christmas festivities a little easier in my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intervention has two purposes, first to say clearly to the hon. Gentleman that if his question means that he spends a little longer on his speech so that the Minister cannot answer this morning, may be an advantage because I believe that he may wish to consider some of the comments of hon. Members, especially the question that I now wish to put to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (3), which the hon. Gentleman argues should be eliminated, if it said that the Secretary of State may appoint a person who will be entirely different from the person who he then gets to carry out various services from him so that he is completely separate, surely that would be good. However, they are to be one and the same—judge and jury. Surely, that option would be acceptable to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand correctly my new whipping instructions, I shall need to slow to an extremely slow pace, which may enable us on Thursday to avoid many votes. I shall speak slowly. I understand the point made by the hon. Gentleman. It was very clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend not only welcome my intervening, but consider that there is a major point to be discussed? I believe that he and I are at one in believing that the Minister's intervention was inadequate on the future as envisaged under subsection (3). However, there is a crucial question. Is the person to be appointed under subsection (3) to be completely independent and completely outside son of the NFFC, or will that person be the independent chief executive appointed by the Secretary of State to the NFFC, given the duties that will be laid upon that person under subsection (3)? The difference is crucial. I shall welcome my hon. Friend's thoughts on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening and for pinpointing the problem with such accuracy. It is the very problem to which I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
the Minister will turn his mind. We must be assured that the appointment under subsection (3) is of a physical human being. I cannot foresee any difficulty if the person appointed is a physical person as opposed to a corporate body. He must be a physical person. Moreover, he should have two functions. First, he should be chief executive of the new son, but it is essential that he has a second function—the power to advise and assist in the operation of clause 4(1)(b), which is different in its scope and nature from clause 4(1)(a). That is why I told my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham that I was not happy with the amendments that included my name. On thinking the matter through—I urge the Minister to think the matter through—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. I did not think that the hon. Gentleman was in danger of drying up. I wished to ask him to give me a little time to consider the matter. It seems worthy of consideration by those hon. Members who have spoken thus far that the practice to which we are referring in this legislation is no different from the existing system. I shall develop in some detail our intentions when I reply to the debate on Thursday. The system is a continuance of the present practice under which the NFFC carries out both functions—investment and development fundings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. It seems that some of the pressure from the Committee is beginning to tell. I hope that by Thursday it will have told effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be accepted that the son of the NFFC has a function. It is intended to be the funding source for films that are to be made. People will come to the son with that object in mind. I have received the assurance that the chief executive of the body would be utterly independent so that he could not be controlled, as it were, by the four partners, or however more participants become involved, in that aspect of his function. We are saying only that that independent human being so appointed also has several other functions that can be carried out from his office—his office in the "son", not the Sun. Those are the functions that are necessary under clause 4(1)(b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
