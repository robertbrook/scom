	<div class='legislation'>The Civil Aviation Act (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Civil Aviation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 76).</p></blockquote>
The regulations are important and raise knotty and difficult problems that the Minister will be keen to answer. First, however, I want to commend the United Kingdom aircraft industry for its tremendous safety record. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will underline that point. It is often put to me that were the road safety record to be comparable to that of the aeroplane business, the Minister might be out of a job. Aircraft crashes are so dramatic, spectacular and invariably so lethal that although they are infrequent, they gain immense public attention. None of my remarks should be taken in an alarmist sense. We merely wish to maintain a high standard, in particular that set by UK-registered aircraft. My comments about foreign-registered aircraft and accidents, however, may not be so complimentary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are of vital concern to many, most significantly to the travelling public who need to be reassured of the thoroughness of the accident investigation process and the contribution it continues to make to aviation safety. But they are also of concern to aircraft manufacturers in terms of ensuring that correct lessons are learnt and applied when designing, redesigning and maintaining aircraft, and when producing aircraft from their production lines. They are equally relevant to airline companies, which want to maintain the confidence of their customers, and to airline pilots who, with their crew, have a professional interest in contributing to airline safety, not only for personal safety reasons but because a loss of confidence in airline travel will put their employment at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reassure us that air accident investigation procedure and regulations are as watertight as he would like to see them? A number of air accidents have occurred even during the brief time that I have been in charge of this portfolio: the domestic flight in Peru last week which killed all its passengers; the Alas Nacionalas crash in the Dominican Republic and a recent crash in Colombia which, sadly, resulted in many fatalities. Despite the recent Government improvements to safety monitoring processes issued on 10 January this year by Lord Goschen in the other place, I am still
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
concerned—as I am sure we all are—about the risks of foreign-registered aircraft, subject to unknown checks, that fly into and out of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth stating that the Civil Aviation Authority operates a system of checks in the UK which is probably second to none, but its jurisdiction over foreign-registered aircraft is more limited. If a fault is pointed out to the CAA or to the Department, a check can be made. There is also provision for additional checks to be made arising out of the Coventry air crash and Lord Goschen's statement on 10 January. None the less, there is cause for worry that many foreign-registered aircraft may not have the same safety and operational standards that we expect from aircraft inspected by domestic CAA inspectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a couple of examples. A Swedish airline flying in from Manchester using aircraft registered in Sweden may rarely return home. Shortly after Honduras-registered aircraft were offered to holidaymakers travelling from Coventry, they were banned from flying to the USA. Those aircraft are still operating in the United Kingdom despite that US ban, but they are now registered by Slovakia, Liberia and Cyprus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Greek-registered aircraft, operated by Bulgarian and Spanish crews, based in the UK, have been transporting UK passengers. Because they are operated outside the country of registration, the UK authorities have no jurisdiction over maintenance and operating standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final example concerns a Latvian airline. Mr. Brian Simpson, the MEP for Cheshire, East, has raised with me the problem of old eastern European aircraft in the UK. Perhaps my hon. Friends would like to take the matter up with the Minister. In mid-June last year, the Latvian airline operated services from Manchester to Spain and Greece. It used a Yak-42 aircraft registered in Russia, not Latvia, which therefore operated under Russian regulations. Several small tour operators had contracted capacity on the flights, having been led to believe that they were to be flown by a United Kingdom airline. Several of them withdrew their business when they became aware of the country of origin. The operation collapsed a few weeks later, but only after seven weeks of regular flying from UK airports similar to the airport near the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Keen).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prevention of crashes is the main purpose of the regulations. They refer to the investigation of accidents, but we all hope that that stage is not reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK aviation watchdog—the CAA—enforces the effective upkeep and maintenance of British registered aircraft, but passengers are reliant on other signatory countries to international aviation agreements monitoring the aircraft registered in their countries, or on the Department of Transport increasing surveillance when it believes an aircraft to be unsafe. Neither of those options will totally reassure Labour Members. It is a worrying anomaly that while the Federal Aviation Authority has banned aircraft from several countries from operating to and from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
United States, those aircraft can still operate to and from the UK. That is a matter of great concern. I am sure that the Minister can tell us why that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister fears tit-for-tat retaliation from countries such as Honduras or Ghana. If so, will he consider at leisure whether a satisfactory solution might be to institute a Europe-based inspection system? If that were done under the auspices of the European Union, individual countries might find UK airlines a less easy target for retaliation in the event of their aircraft being subject to random inspection at UK airports. I leave that suggestion with the Minister for his consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the measures announced recently by the Government in response to the air accidents investigation branch's recommendations on the Coventry incident. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Cunningham) raised the issue on the Floor of the House last week. The report recommended tighter aviation safety checks by the implementation of a scheduled programme of inspection of carriers in the United Kingdom from countries that have been identified by the FAA as risky or which have been the subject of passenger complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we remain worried that checks for airworthiness and operational standards—which is a catch-all term that includes getting on and off aircraft, the procedures for taking off and landing and the ability of crews to talk to one another in the same language—do not take place as a matter of course on foreign-registered aircraft that are chartered by tour operators. We shall continue to press the Minister to introduce such regulations as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time is long overdue for British passengers to enjoy the same safety standards and the same sense of security that is available to passengers in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to independence, I must refer the Minister to annexe 13 of the 1992 International Civil Aviation Organisation report, which states in paragraph 5.4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The accident investigation authority shall have independence in the conduct of the investigation and have unrestricted authority over its conduct."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 5.4.1, it went on to recommend:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability should be separate from any investigation conducted under the provision of the Annex."</p></blockquote>
I seek the Minister's confirmation that such independence is—and will continue to be—provided under the British system of accident investigation. Is any action by the British aviation authorities appropriate when other accident investigation systems cannot demonstrate that they meet ICAO standards?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the British Air Line Pilots Association made representations to the Minister about the disclosure of information, about which there is much concern. The 1992 ICAO annexe states in paragraph 5.2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The State conducting the investigation or an accident or incident, wherever it occurred, shall not make the following records available for purposes other than accident or incident investigation, unless the appropriate authority for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
administration of justice in that State determines that their disclosure outweighs the adverse domestic and international impact such action may have on that or any future investigation."</p></blockquote>
I understand that those anxieties stem in part from the sensational use by the media of conversations between pilots. When an accident occurs, newspapers and especially television stations are keen to report what pilots were saying to each other and to air traffic control. For example, in Washington a television station broadcast pilots' exchanges about what they had been doing the previous night, which may have been of prurient interest to the viewers, but contributed nothing to the proper investigation of the accident. Pilots are rightly worried that recordings of flight conversations should be made public only when the investigating authorities feel that that is appropriate, and they feel that those recordings should not be used in a sensational manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant annexe lists the statements that were taken during the course of the investigation, all communications between persons involved in the operation of an aircraft and, importantly, cockpit voice recordings and transcripts of those recordings. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of setting BALPA's mind at rest about accident investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—if I may stray a little, but not too far, Mr. O'Hara—I want to ask the Minister about aviation safety and air accident investigation at the European level. I touched on that matter a little earlier. I understand that the European Commission is concerned about the implications of a pan-European body such as the Joint Aviation Authority governing aviation safety, given the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act. There is, for example, a paper from the Commission entitled "Working Paper concerning the Establishment of a single European organisation responsible for aviation safety". That is separate, in my view, from inspection. I hope that the Minister will consider the possibility of a pan-European inspection service to protect our investigators from retaliation, but this is a separate matter about aviation safety in general. That paper was published in December 1995 and proposes the abolition of the JAA and the setting up of a new body at EU level, of which non-EU states could be associate members. The important issue is political accountability of any such body and I should like to hear how the Minister will ensure that those responsible for aviation safety remain accountable to Parliament and what progress his Department has made in response to that paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I can say of the statutory instrument that it is fairly technical and dry, but I hope that the Minister will respond to some of the slightly broader points that we have put on the record in respect of air accident investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish as I started, by saying that I raise these matters not be sensationalist but to help to ensure that the safety record, especially of the UK-registered fleet, is maintained at the very high level that it enjoys at the moment, and that foreign-registered aircraft that fly in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and out of the UK are subject to the procedures that would at least bring them into line with standards of safety that we are privileged to enjoy in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was persuaded to rise to my feet when my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) mentioned Yaks. It worries me greatly that those clapped-out aircraft from Russia and eastern Europe are being chartered in the United Kingdom to take British holidaymakers to Mediterranean and other resorts. I am very concerned that those aircraft should be properly maintained, but I suspect that they are not. We are discussing not just Yaks but Tupolevs and other such aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rolls-Royce at Barnoldswick in my constituency makes RB.211s, the Trent series of engine and so on, so there is a lot of skill in my constituency. I know that I speak for many of my constituents who want Government support to put British engines on the airframes of those old Russian aeroplanes—the Tupolevs and perhaps the Yaks—to make them safe. Perhaps I may press the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a reply to a parliamentary question today stating that the Export Credits Guarantee Department was alive to the issue of putting RB.211s on Tupolev airframes, but perhaps the Minister will expand on that and reassure me today that the Government will do all that is in their power to ensure that those aircraft from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have British engines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I emphasise what my hon. Friend on the Front Bench, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, said—that although this appears to be another very dry statutory instrument, it has major ramifications because if safety is not spot on, the consequences are dire. I hope that the Minister can give us the reassurance that my hon. Friend asked for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, Before the debate proceeds, I remind the Committee that we are debating the Civil Aviation Act (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 1996. I allowed the hon. Member for Nottingham, North some latitude when he made extensive remarks about aircraft safety because there is obviously a connection between aircraft safety and accidents—and, therefore, investigations. Having allowed that latitude to the main Opposition spokesman, I ask the Committee to bear in mind the fact that the investigation of accidents is the central subject of our consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.50 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Toby Jessel 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to accidents and the investigation of accidents, I hope that you, Mr. O'Hara, will put me in a position to ask the Minister for assurances that will set at rest the minds of my constituents, in case they are needlessly alarmed by the remarks of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who said that he wanted British
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
passengers to have the same standard of safety as United States passengers. Investigations are related to safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the investigation of any accident at Heathrow is such that there has been no major crash there for about 25 years—since 1971—whereas in the United States, it seems that hardly a year goes by without a serious crash. Heathrow is the second most heavily trafficked airport in the world. I should like the Minister to remind the Committee about the relative safety of travel by air, by car, by bicycle and on foot, to set the minds of the public at rest so that they are not needlessly worried by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, an aircraft accident that has to be investigated normally involves many people all bunched together in one aircraft, which is highly newsworthy. A larger number of fatalities happen in ones and twos to pedestrians and people in cars, but that might attract less media attention even though the incidents in total might be worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Keen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Feltham and Heston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham, North and for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), said. We all think that accidents happen to other people, but I have just finished my year with the Royal Air Force on the armed forces parliamentary scheme and, having flown in virtually every RAF aeroplane, it is a sobering thought to consider how many of them have crashed in the past 12 months—some with fatalities and some not. I believe that seven have already crashed this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live within 200 or 300 yards of the flight path in Brentford and it is extremely noisy, even though the aircraft are not directly overhead. I worked for 15 years directly under the flight path, no more than half a mile from the touchdown point at Heathrow. My constituents who live within a couple of hundred yards of the fence at Heathrow—particularly in Cranford—feel, as well as hear, the noise when aeroplanes land on the northern runway from the east. It is an experience that even the constituents of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Jessel) do not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cranford, people can hear the roar of the aeroplane as it lands and, a couple of seconds later, they hear the rat-tat-tat-bang-bang of the roof tiles falling back again after the vortex effect. People in my constituency never forget the dangers of aircraft crashes. I remember being stuck in a traffic jam on the A30 at Staines when the crash took place there. I was travelling back to Feltham from a Sunday afternoon visit to the west of London. The thought of an accident frightens people in Feltham and Heston. It is vital that inspections are carried out and that people have confidence that the inspection is independent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully support the points that hon. Member for Twickenham made about the importance of not exaggerating air safety problems. But we have a marvellous safety record only because our safety procedures are extremely tight. That record is a tribute to those who operate the safety procedures.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston. However, I stress that a crash occurred recently in Coventry. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East drew attention to it in a debate that took place just a week or so ago. It was a terrible accident, but it could have been even worse, because the plane came close to crashing on a major population centre. We must ensure that our safety procedures are tight and we must pay due respect to those who investigate accidents, but we must also be careful not to become complacent. A terrible disaster almost occurred in Coventry; hundreds of lives could have been lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. My constituents are always aware of the problem. I fear that those who live even short distances away do not quite share our understanding. It is vital for people to have confidence in the inspection and reporting system. Openness in reporting is important. We must learn from crashes that happen throughout the world; information about them should be open to all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to praise the British Airports Authority and British Airways. Many of my constituents work for those two companies and have great confidence in them. Some of my constituents are responsible for the safety of British Airways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital to give confidence to people who live near all British airports. Like my constituents, those people contribute to one of our greatest industries—the air transport industry—not only by working there during the day and the night, but, as the hon. Member for Twickenham knows well, by putting up with environmental damage. They deserve the best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew from the outset that you were a generous soul, Mr. O'Hara. Our proceedings confirm your admirable generosity. As you rightly pointed out, we are considering regulations about the investigation of accidents. It might offend the spirit of the Committee if I were to say a word about that subject—we have talked about everything else but that. We have discussed Yak-42s, Tupolevs and RB.211s, about which I cannot satisfy the hon. Member for Pendle. Perhaps he could use the parliamentary system to table questions about Yaks—presumably, they will be referred to my colleagues in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food before eventually finding their way to my desk. My noble Friend the Minister for Aviation and Shipping and I will then consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it is old fashioned to want to talk about the regulations, but I shall do that if you will forgive me for straying into order, Mr. O'Hara. The House will want to endorse the regulations because they are simple and uncontroversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations allow for the implementation of Council directive 94/56/EC of 21 November 1995, which establishes the fundamental principles that govern the investigation of civil aviation accidents and
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
incidents. They have been considered by all the relevant authorities and it is generally agreed that they are unexceptionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment on the points that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North raised about the regulations on behalf of BALPA, which he contacted earlier today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points about the functional independence of the investigating body. First, there has never been the slightest question about the independence or integrity of the air accidents investigation branch; with the marine accidents investigation branch of the Department of Transport, it is recognised throughout the world as having the highest standards of integrity in operation and is admired for that. The functional independence of the investigating body is assured by article 6 of the directive, which specifically requires it, and we have no intention of departing from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the disclosure of records, an interesting proposition which runs counter to the general proposition that as much as possible should be in the public arena, something with which I have no difficulty as a former chairman of the Campaign for Freedom of Information. Anyone who is involved in information issues recognises that the most difficult territory is when a person believes that anything he says may be available for public scrutiny and therefore liable to be rehashed in a sensational form by those who know precious little about the subject. In such cases, people simply do not speak. Their evidence is therefore denied to investigators whose job is to try to get at the truth. That is as true in relation to cockpit voice recorders as it is to other evidence that might be obtained in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations to implement the changes to annexe 13 of the Chicago convention and the requirements of the directive will fully implement the requirement of paragraph 5(12) of that annexe relating to the disclosure of records. I therefore give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends raised various matters about the safety and inspection of aircraft. I remind the Committee of the statement made by my noble Friend The Under Secretary in another place when he announced increased surveillance of foreign aircraft operating to the United Kingdom, United Kingdom assistance in the new ICAO safety oversight procedures and new procedures for the approval of wet-leased aircraft—that is, aircraft leased with a crew. All those points were in direct response to the Coventry accident. Although the standards that we set in this country are among the best, if not the best, in the world, there was clearly a need there to ensure that the administration of the system was as efficient as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department is also consulting the industry and users about possible amendments to policies affecting fifth freedom charter flights by foreign operators. That consultation takes safety requirements very much into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North raised the interesting matter of whether there was any value in a Europe-wide investigation body. That question can be considered on several levels. The European Community has already recognised the expertise of the Joint Aviation Authority. EC regulation 3922/91 required the aviation authorities of all member states to belong to the JAA and the regulation also adopted some of the standards set by the JAA as the harmonised European standards. That system is working well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to proposals for a single aviation authority and a single Europe wide investigation authority, the House, the industry and all those interested in safety will want to consider whether the impact of such a proposal will improve safety standards. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North will know that, surprisingly, a Swedish aircraft was among those refused a licence to fly under our procedures; it was not just a Russian aircraft that was affected. It would be most unfortunate if the creation of an EC body meant that the entire convoy proceeded at the speed of the slowest ship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, Britain has led Europe in all safety matters. We have a very safety conscious culture in marine and aviation matters and in road safety, which we discussed today on the Floor of the House. We will consider the proposition because it is reasonable to do so, but I counsel caution. We are concerned not about whether there is a body, where its headquarters should be located and whether it is comprised of a given number of nation states, but rather about whether the creation of such a body leads to safer standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I referred to a pan-European body, I meant a limited protective mechanism to prevent the United Kingdom authorities from being picked off tit-for-tat retaliatory action. For example, if we inspected a plane from a less than respectable country—a less than top-10 country, in aviating terms—it might try to ground BA or Virgin in retaliation. If the inspection authority were under EU auspices for that limited purpose, we would have the protection of a larger body of countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Threats of retaliation, which are always extraordinarily veiled and rather opaque, tend not to come from other EU member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a valid argument to adduce in deciding what the best forum for a body would be, although the United Kingdom's position generally has been that those matters are best left to unilateral action, if only because our standards are demonstrably higher than
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
those elsewhere, even in the Community. I referred to the requirement that EC members should be members of the JAA, which makes the point forcibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham and the hon. Member for Feltham and Heston rightly spoke about the excellent record of Heathrow airport and British airlines generally. Those comments were entirely appropriate as they accurately reflect the position. Those who live next to airports in the UK can be reassured—as it was necessary to reassure the people of Coventry, who suffererd from the aftermath of that crash—that the regime for inspection and particularly the regime for the investigation of accidents in this country operate to the highest standards in the world. On that basis, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Nottingham, North to respond, may I comment on the airworthiness of certain contributions, in terms of their strict relevance to the subject of debate. It is a difficult matter, as there is obviously a close connection between aircraft safety, accidents and accident investigation. Perhaps the balance of contributions got a little out of kilter, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of a celebrated debate in May 1791 on the Quebec Government Bill, in which Mr. Burke insisted on the relevance of Paine's "The Rights of Man" and recent events of the French Revolution. Perhaps "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" might have come into this afternoon's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Nottingham, North wishes to respond, I would ask him to match the Minister's admirably aerodynamic performance in respect of strict relevance to the subject under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for the generous way in which you have chaired our proceedings. We seek to use statutory instruments to hold the Government to account, and sometimes we hold them to account for more than the statutory instrument before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for the generous way in which he responded, even to those points that may not have been wholly pertinent to a line-by-line consideration of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
