	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment, I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution. I do not propose to direct that it should be read, but there are copies available at the Table for the convenience of hon. Members. May I also ask hon. Members to give adequate notice of Amendments, as manuscript Amendments are inconvenient to all concerned and I shall endeavour not to select them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>(The National Research Development Corporation.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 5, to leave out from "be," to "the," in line 6, and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"incorporated under the Companies Act, 1948, a company by the name of."</p></blockquote>
The effect of this Amendment is to make the agency or medium which will carry out this business a limited company under the Companies Act. I press this point upon the Government as a matter of convenience for everybody concerned. I rather deprecate the continuing creation of more and more exotic bodies. There have to be special Clauses put into Bills to say that their accounts shall be conducted according to the best commercial standards, and that they must make a report of this, that and the other. It will be greatly for the convenience of administration if this kind of work is carried out by a limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1948. All these questions will then fall naturally into their place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
They will have statutory duties to make reports, with standard forms relating to quorums, duties, obligations and responsibilities of directors, and so on. There is no reason why this very high-sounding Corporation should not be a limited company, with the Government holding all the shares. Perhaps it is unnecessary to make the initial capital very big, though I personally think that the losses which this Corporation will suffer will be very large unless they are abnormally lucky. I press upon the Government the fact that it will be greatly to their convenience to have a well established form of vehicle on which to carry this kind of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Patrick Hannon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. There is a tendency in the Government to multiply organisations within its administration, adding to what we call, sometimes in kindly terms and sometimes in unkindly terms, the bureaucracy under which the country is now very largely governed. If this Bill means the addition of a new organisation or Department, I think it ought to be done in the way suggested in the Amendment. It is a great pity that we should multiply the machinery of Government and that, week after week, we should add new Departments and branches to the administration. Already we have in existence the machinery necessary to carry out work of this kind. I think this Bill will do a great deal of good, but I suggest that the more simple its structure the easier it will be to achieve the object in view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this case there is even more need than usual for such principles as are included in this Amendment. This Corporation is to be given powers to act in the nature of a parent company to subsidiary companies. It is not as though the Corporation were only to act as themselves without Government assistance, without the assistance of public funds. They have wider powers than that. They can form subsidiaries over which they will have to maintain control. In the circumstances, it would be much better and more simple for everyone if we insisted that their operations should be conducted in this way, and that the records of their operations should be maintained on exactly the same lines as are insisted upon for any other form of enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
I put greater value on the presentation of accounts and records which would result from the acceptance of this Amendment, than I place on any other aspect of the matter. I am sure the Minister will agree that where there is this sort of structure with a parent company and subsidiary bodies it is essential that the full story should be told. That story should be set out in a form which can be readily understood. If we accept a standard for other forms of enterprise, is it not necessary that the same standard should apply to the type of enterprise outlined in the Bill? By that standard we get an accepted form of balance sheet which is easily understood, the terms of which are insisted upon by statute. The Government would be wise to accept this Amendment and, in accepting it, to accept as proper standards those which they have insisted upon for other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wavell Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Clause 3 it is shown that it is intended that this Corporation should be profit earning. We, hope it will earn profits. It seems to me that the body ought to be in the form of a public limited liability company, and not in the form of a Corporation. I can envisage propositions arising whereby shares may be taken in a joint company, together with private enterprise, to exploit or to develop an invention or patent. If this Corporation is to carry out development work jointly with private people or industry, it would be more convenient if it were organised in the form of a limited liability company. Then it would be the better able to take shares in, and to participate in, development work with other limited liability companies. There would be a better basis of comparison and a more simple machinery than that which exists in an indefinite corporation. A corporation may be all right for a large nationalised industry, but it does not appear to be suitable for the requirements which I see in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support the Amendment from the point of view of the private inventor. If the body to which an inventor has to go is left in a vague and amorphous form it is quite likely that he will turn to the alternative bodies which already exist. In the City of London there are already two very large corporations which were formed by the Bank of England a good
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
many years ago, and which may be competitive in this line. If inventors who have something of value believe that they will be looked after by a body whose accounts and reports they will see annually in the normal course of events it is much more likely that that body will attract to it the really serious and good inventors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Companies Act was passed a short while ago. The presentation of accounts and the directors' report has been brought up to date in every way. It seems a little curious that a Government who have spent a good deal of time and attention in that way should now be acting in this slightly ostentatious manner by producing a body which does not come under that Act in any way at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade (Mr. Belcher)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to notice the very great enthusiasm with which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton) appeared to welcome this Bill. I share the desire of the hon. Member for Moseley (Sir P. Hannon), and other hon. Members opposite, that the affairs of this Corporation should be carefully controlled in the best interests of the country. I do not, however, share their belief that it is essential to turn it from a Corporation into a limited liability company. There has been some talk about the form of accounts being protected if the Corporation were turned into a limited liability company. The form of accounts of the proposed Corporation is laid down already in Clause 10 as having to conform to the best commercial standards. They must be presented to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations governing the constitution of the Corporation will have to be laid before Parliament and these, together with certain provisions in the Bill, will correspond to the memorandum and articles of association of a limited liability company. The annual report to the President of the Board of Trade, provided in Clause 4 (3), will correspond to the report to shareholders under the Companies Act. Again, in exactly the same way as a limited liability company, the Corporation will be able to sue and be liable to be sued. Therefore, I do not see that anything can be gained by accepting this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever might be the convenience of bringing the new body under existing company law, I think it would be more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
than offset by the inconvenience of applying a law which was designed to regulate in detail the activities of bodies operating according to the ordinary aims and objects of commerce. The Corporation is a body whose primary function is not to satisfy the requirements, needs or desires of shareholders, but to perform a public service using the commercial rules of profit and loss simply as a guide to its activities. We feel strongly that there is something to be said for giving to a body of this kind, whose primary function is to serve the public interest and not the private interest of a body of shareholders, a status under Parliamentary statute different from that which applies to an ordinary commercial enterprise. I ask my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee to support me in resisting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary, during the earlier part of his remarks, except for one slight inaccuracy, which was unintentional, and which I should like to correct, put forward an eloquent and lucid argument in favour of the Amendment. First, let me correct his inaccuracy. He said we had said that it was essential that this Corporation should be a limited company. That would make complete nonsense of all we have said. It is not a question of being essential, it is obvious that this Corporation could carry on under the Act, with all the verbiage and garbage already surrounding it. But it would be very much more convenient if it were a limited company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say that in every respect the Corporation was exactly parallel and coincided with a public corporation. He referred to the Clause relating to the accounts. All this verbiage would be unnecessary if it were made a limited company, and we should be creating a vehicle which everybody would recognise. I shall have a few remarks to make about Clause 3 when we come to it. The whole of his argument was designed to show that what the Opposition wants is a limited company. It is a limited company in everything except name. I would like to see the matrimonial gold band placed upon the finger of the Corporation, to make her a respectable woman under the Companies Act, rather than see the Corporation lead a loose life under a set of rules which the Government may frame from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
I was horrified to learn that no part of the function of the Corporation is to look after the shareholders. I would remind the Committee that the shareholders happen to be the hon. Members on both, sides of the Committee. In embarking on this very perilous sea I hope the Government will remember that they are dealing with the taxpayers' money. I hope the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary will be corrected before we pass on to another Clause. Part of an enterprise of this kind must be to look after the shareholders' money. The shareholders are the taxpayers. For a Minister of the Crown solemnly to say that this Corporation is to carry on with public money without regard to the interests of the shareholders is almost too strong for my stomach, even at half-past ten in the morning. I hope we can get that altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that this Amendment is essential. I am pleading to the Government to use an established vehicle, and telling them that in every respect, including the economy of words, which I know is horrible to some of their advisers, they will find it highly convenient to carry on these activities as a limited company in which the Government are the only shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry for the right hon. Gentleman's stomach. I would point out that I did not say, and have never said, that it was no part of the interest of the Corporation to look after the taxpayers' money. On the contrary, I said it was precisely their duty primarily to safeguard the interest of the taxpayer as well as protecting the efficiency of the country. I would like to make that plain. I recognise, of course, the need for the Corporation to look after the taxpayers' money, but it will stand in a different light from a limited liability company, whose primary duty is to look after the shareholders. The primary duty of this Corporation is to look after the development of inventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The primary duty of any board of directors in a public company is to protect the assets of the company. It is not primarily interested in seeing that vast profits are made. That is the completely analogous difference of this. Corporation. That being so, I should have thought the argument had doubled in strength for the translation of the Cor-

	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
poration into the form of a limited company. I am shocked by the words which have dribbled from the Parliamentary Secretary. I cannot believe that they have been filtered by any responsible mechanism within or without the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir W. Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not profoundly shocked, because we have had this form of shock administered so very frequently that I get more or less used to it. But this experiment must be so conducted as to create confidence in everybody concerned—the shareholders, the inventors,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is in the nature of an exploratory Amendment. The difficulties we have about this Clause relate to the second part of Subsection (2):</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>

	<p>the people administering it and the general public. To create the maximum confidence we should have a form which does not suffer from these disabilities. For the sake of the main effect of this Bill, which is to create confidence, it would be much wiser to adopt an established form which the Government have recently streamlined and brought up to date.</p>

	<p>Question put, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>

	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 11; Noes, 7.</p>

	<p>"the expression 'public research' means research carried out by a Government department or other public body or any other research in respect of which financial assistance is provided out of public funds."</p>

	<p>Those words seem to bring within the definition of public research all research in which there is any Government participation whatever. I do not think that is the intention of the Government. It would be a pity to leave it in that way. I do not know whether the words which I have suggested are sufficiently all-embracing for the purpose, but we. put them on the Order Paper as an exploratory Amendment.</p>

	<p>There are many cases where private companies are carrying out research for the Government at their own expense in which there is nevertheless, some financial assistance, either in the price of the product or assistance from the Government in defraying expenses, which I do not think can be described as public research within the meaning of this Section. We are not wedded to these particular words, but we should like to see that any research in respect of which financial assistance is provided out of public funds is narrowed down, or more closely defined than it is in the Bill. It would appear that anything in which the Government had even a peppercorn of interest would fall under the expression "public research,"which it certainly should not do.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir W. Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. I think there should be a closer definition of exactly what is public research. For instance, a Government Department makes a regular practice of providing money to public or private companies, or even individuals, to carry out research, but, quite a substantial amount of the financial burden of carrying out that research may also be borne by the public or private company, or the individual carrying it out. Such a case, and there are many of them, could not possibly be considered to be public research. It is a partnership in research, some of which may be public and some private. It may be that the public part is the major portion, or it may very well be that it is quite a minor portion. For that reason there should be a closer definition, such as is suggested in the Amendment, or some other arrangement, so that the kind of research work which I have described may be, and ought to be, very properly excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The actual definition of the types of research in this Subsection covers the activities of the Corporation to a fundamental degree. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree. If the words are too wide, and the definition too wide and all embracing, it would give the Corporation the right to attract to themselves, and to monopolise, inventions which are the result of research with the absolute minimum of Government assistance. Frequently, that assistance is not by way of direct financial grants, but a research worker is loaned or sent out to an industrial concern by the Government to carry on their own research. It would be very embarrassing, therefore, to leave this definition quite as vague as it appears to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there may be some misunderstanding in the mind of the hon. Member for St. Marylebone (Sir W. Wakefield), because we are not dealing here with compulsory powers for individuals or institutions. The whole point of the use of the words "public research" in the Bill is that the Corporation is called upon to satisfy itself that a private invention is not in use by any other person before the Corporation develops or exploits it. In the case of an invention resulting from public research it is not put under the statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
requirement laid down in the Bill. The object of the Amendment is more clearly to define what is meant by public research to meet that provision. I do not think the right hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton) feels that he has found the right form of words. The Amendment would leave out substantial bodies undertaking research in this country, such as the universities, and Medical and Agricultural Research Councils. If the Amendment were carried, these bodies would be classed with private inventors, and their inventions could only be developed and exploited after the Corporation had fulfilled its statutory duty and satisfied itself that the inventions were not being developed or exploited by anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the universities and Medical and Agricultural Research Councils are financed wholly or partly through public funds, there does not seem to be any reason why they should be treated differently from those coming, through research, under the control of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research—not, as it appears in the Amendment, the Department of Industrial and Scientific Research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 8, after "provided," to insert "wholly or mainly."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious on this side of the Committee to clarify the position which will obtain between the organisations which exist wholly or partly on public research, and the manner in which the Corporation will acquire the inventions under the power which it possesses. There is a feeling on our part that there will become an almost automatic vesting of inventions which arise out of public research in the hands of the Corporation. In those circumstances, we are naturally anxious to make clear that this should not be done to the disadvantage of private individuals or trade associations who have spent a lot of money in establishing research organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This becomes more urgent because we are to establish, and are now in the process of establishing, development councils, one of the functions of which will be to promote research. I hope and believe it is the Government's intention not to set up a lot of separate research organisations, but to utilise the existing research
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
bodies already set up by industries, and to increase their activities by grants. One might cite the Shirley Institute in connection with the cotton textile in, dustry. There, the trade has spent an enormous sum of money in establishing what is perhaps the best institute of its kind in the world. We regard with some fear the prospect that the Government will come along and use that institute in five years' time, having put into it a small sum of money in relation to the sum total of capital expenditure in that organisation, and say that the Corporatotemism tion has the right automatically to acquire inventions which may be discovered as the result of their research. We are most anxious to get a firm assurance from the Government on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, the words in the Amendment. "wholly or mainly" define the matter in a satisfactory way. If we cannot have this assurance, we want to have a clearer idea of the limitations that are to be imposed on the Corporation in acquiring inventions. We do not want to see the people who put most of the money into these organisations denied the right of exploiting their inventions as the result of the activities of the Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment, if the hon. Member for Bucklow (Mr. Shepherd) does not withdraw it. There is no conflict of principle between us, and the Amendment appears to be quite unnecessary. The paragraph deals with assistance provided out of public funds. When research is assisted by grants of so much from the Government, and so much out of other funds, it still comes within the area where assistance is provided out of public funds, and it is unnecessary to say "wholly or mainly." On the second point, if the Government provide money which has been spent on an invention, the relationship between the relative ownership interest will be defined by contract, and the Corporation will have to fulfil the contract. The Bill covers this point admirably, and I do not, therefore, see the necessity for the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Parliamentary Secretary mean by that? Surely, in giving that reply, he has in mind the words of Subsection (1, 
	<i>b</i>)
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"of acquiring, holding, disposing of, and granting rights (whether gratuitously or for consideration) in connection with inventions …."</p></blockquote>
which have been devised by a research body which might only have been assisted from public funds to the degree which I mentioned when we were considering the last Amendment, namely, that a research worker has been loaned to them from a Government research institution. In that case, under the definition as it stands, without the Amendment, the Corporation would have powers gratuitously to grant licences for the use of a patent which they said fell within their own powers without any consideration to anybody. They can do that gratuitously. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is right when he says that everything would depend on the terms of the contract entered into between the Government Department and the research association, when the research association receives Government assistance—we can all go through that rigmarole; but I do not think that when one gets a loan of some machinery or testing gear, or the loan of a research worker, which technically, would bring that research association within the very wide terms of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), it is quite safe to leave the matter in that form in the Bill. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter. At a later stage, we might find some means of filtering out the good from the bad, and clarifying the position. As the Clause stands, any private research organisation, or any research organisation which receives only temporary assistance of the most minor degree from public funds, can have its invention taken away by the Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that before this morning's Sitting is finished hon. Members will have realised that there is no power of compulsory acquisition of invention.

	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
and it will have to be agreed—then there will be a contract which will limit the Corporation in precisely the same way as any other body is limited by contract. That is the whole answer to the fears expressed by hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am comforted to some extent by the assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary, and if we can be certain that the Corporation has no powers to tell a research association to sell its share of an invention, or do something with it which it does not wish to do, I should be satisfied with the wording as it stands.

	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to make one observation on the constitution of the board of directors who will actually control the Corporation. It is necessary to have people on the Corporation who have some knowledge of the processes of inventions, not only in their technical and scientific aspect, but from the point of view of their commercial and practical potentialities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be "members," and not "directors."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that I should have said "members." Had the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment been carried the word "directors" would have been probably more appropriate in the circumstances. I trust that I did not give anything away which I might have had in my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in the circumstances, the Board of Trade will realise that if these inventions are to be considered not only from the scientific point of view, but also from the point of view of their commercial potentialities, it is necessary to have people on the Corporation who have some practical knowledge of industry, as well as the scientific knowledge which is so vital. I hope that organisations such as the National Institute of Patentees may have an opportunity of having one of their representatives on the board, be-
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
cause they have a great deal of experience of examining inventions, and advising people who come to them with inventions of the potentialities of their ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other very important point, namely, that people in industry are well aware that the inventor regards his own idea as the most important invention in the world. It is very difficult to convince such people that their inventions, which may have certain scientific niceties in themselves, do not represent anything which can result in their invention having a commercial value. In those circumstances, it is vital that there should be members of the Corporation who can deal with these points, and who have some knowledge of the attitude of mind of inventors. It is sometimes a very complex attitude of mind and difficult to understand. My whole purpose in raising this point is to express to the Board of Trade what I think is in the mind of every Member of this Committee, that the Corporation shall be so constituted as to represent all phases of the necessary knowledge and technical skill and ability, so that no one can feel that he has not had a square deal when the question of his invention comes to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Haden Guest</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it should be made plain that while it is necessary and essential to look after the financial and commercial aspect of the matter—that should be underlined as being one of the phases of the arrangement—there are a great many inventions which have no commercial possibilities at all. It is essential that we should have an enlightened scientific opinion on the Corporation which can inquire into, for instance, medical, agricultural and other scientific matters which will not bring anybody any remuneration directly, but which will be of very great benefit to the community and to industry. I want to emphasise that point of view so as to make it quite clear that this organisation will look after, not only commercial and financial interests—which are essential—but also the wider interest which affects all the community, and which will be of the greatest possible service to industry itself. I would remind hon. Members that a good deal of the work of industrial research associations is not primarily of immediate commercial interest to the firms concerned; it is out of things which are not of immediate commercial interest that

Friend the Member for North Islington (Dr. Guest), I would point out—as he himself has just indicated:—that during the Second Reading Debate we recognised the necessity of providing for the development of inventions which may not necessarily have a commercial, or an immediate commercial value. It was made clear by my right hon. Friend that the job of the staff of the Corporation will call for skill and great experience, and I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton (Mr. J. Lewis) that we will do our very best to see that the men appointed to manage the affairs of this Corporation will possess the necessary skill, judgment and experience over as wide a field as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a Government Department pulls my leg I take it in good part, if I can, but this Clause is really too much for me. I had hoped that this sort of morris dancing, with ribbons, on Millbank was at an end by now, and that we were taking life a lot more seriously; but this piece of 20th century totemism is quite ridiculous. When I first saw this Clause I thought I had got something, and, always being very deferential to what the Government propose, I thought I might have these words incorporated in the articles of association of my own company. Had that been done I should have been able to leave the company and taken no further part in its management, secure in the knowledge that whatever happened throughout the chances and changes of this troublesome world, the Government would be able to cover their expenses. But this mumble-jumble here has crept in under quite different circumstances. Of course, if a Government sponsored agency has a statutory right to levy, for example,
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
a rate, or is in a position to charge the consumer what price it likes, then there is some sense in saying, "I intend to soak the consumer so that my inefficiency is lost in the price which he pays." That happens in other Bills, but some enthusiast in the Board of Trade thought that he would again jam in this sort of Clause in this Bill, where it is absolutely meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here embarking upon one of the most difficult fields of commercial or industrial activity that could be found, and I object strongly to being made a fool of by a Clause like this, or having to ask other people to swallow it. It adds nothing to the Corporation; anybody who, entering the field of invention, drafts a Clause to say, "Whatever happens I will end, taking the bad. years with the good, with my revenue covered," should see a doctor—if there are now any willing to attend him. Perhaps the hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. Guest) would examine the gentleman who put this Clause into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Islington used the phrase "enlightened scientific opinion." I hope he was not taking the two things as synonymous. I think he meant that part of scientific opinion which is enlightened, but if that were his point of view, I suggest the Committee should call upon his services on this occasion. I think the Clause is completely meaningless, is simply verbiage, and that we ought not to be made fools of any more. I hope the Committee will delete it from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir P. Hannon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a most incomprehensible Clause, and I agree with everything that has been said by my right hon. Friend. From time to time in Standing Committees we have had experience of verbosity and obscurity in the drafting of Clauses, but this is certainly the sublime example of that sort of quality of draftsmanship. When it is suggested that we are to carry on the functions of this very important Corporation by taking one year with another, no wonder my right hon. Friend emphasises the importance of having limited restrictions on the functions of the Corporation. By taking one year with another, and mixing one year's finance with that of another year, in order to meet the need to give the public a clarified account of the cost of carrying

	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
on the functions laid down in this Bill, the Government are not doing themselves justice, and when the Parliamentary Secretary speaks I trust he will say how sorry he is that he was not consulted before the Clause was inserted. I am perfectly certain that he will administer a proper and appropriate rebuke to the draftsman responsible for putting into the Bill this obscure and meaningless form of Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, in its purest form, is the most perfect example of the Canute Clause that I have ever seen, in which it is sought to forbid the waters to rise by controlling them by an Act. It really ought to be carefully preserved as one of the finest flowers that have blossomed from the soil of Socialism during the present Parliament. Consider the last few words of the Clause: "taking one year with another." That comes direct from Gilbert and Sullivan. I can hear the chairman of this Corporation saying: "Taking one year with another and another with another the chairman's lot is not a happy one," when, in about three or four years, he starts to report.

The hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. Guest) pointed out that a large proportion of the work of this Corporation must be non-remunerative.

If something of that importance is undertaken by this Corporation, how will it be possible in any way at all to look at it under the terms of this Clause, "taking one year with another"?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that at some stage in the drafting of this Bill somebody has said, "Look here. We have to say something about these people making a profit, or making both ends meet. In that way we might please the Tory Party, because they would like that." I can see the line of argument; it was a synthetic invention of a sop to say that as soon as maybe they had to produce sufficient so that the functions of the Corporation might be fulfilled. But then it was said, "Oh, no. This is really much too narrow. They have to cover outgoings with their revenue taking one year with another." I do not think that is Gilbert and Sullivan at all. In that respect I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury (Mr. W. Fletcher). I think "taking one year with another" is Ali Baba. Then these people said, "No, this is too definite," and so they qualified it with "as soon as maybe" and "taking one year with another." Then they inserted a second qualification:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… in so far as can be done consistently with the fulfilment of their purposes. …"</p></blockquote>
Having made the shattering statement that they have to protect the assets of the nation—because that is a shattering thing to say in any Bill—it was their duty to clarify it. If it were put in perfectly good commonsense English we could not have any Clause of this sort in the Bill at all without so many qualifications that the whole Bill would be robbed of many of its objects, in order to explain how there was to be protection and why it was impossible in every case to make a profit, "taking one year with another"—or even taking 10 years with another 10 years, or 100 years with another 100 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. Guest) is perfectly right. If one of the main functions of the Corporation is to perform a public service which cannot be performed by any other means, well and good. But do not for one moment humbug the country into thinking that in performing a public service which nobody else is able to perform they are able to do so and cover their expenses without mulcting something from the pockets of the people.

I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary sets this Clause to music, and sends it to Mr. Leslie Henson to use in a more suitable place than in this Bill. I do not see why the Government have stopped at this.

It might well be that when licences are granted to people to use inventions which have been developed the fees paid by the licensees shall not be as much as they might have been in other circumstances. There must be upon the Corporation a duty to ensure that in respect of that particular part of their work which

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. On this Clause it seems to be valuable to the Opposition this morning to say that they do not believe the Government would do anything which, in other circumstances, would not be correct or proper. In other Bills the Opposition wish to impose upon the Government some obligation; but here they are saying that it would be quite all right, that it would be reasonable to assume that the Corporation would, in the circumstances, try to make themselves self-sufficient. I think that the Government are quite right in this Bill to take upon themselves this obligation, and to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… as soon as may be after the establishment of the Corporation the return to them from their activities shall be sufficient to meet their outgoings on revenue account. …"</p></blockquote>
I think it can be recognised that it is not possible in a case of this kind, where inventions are being developed over a long period, for the Corporation to balance their budget every year, but there must be an obligation, where an invention is invented one year and exploited the next, for the Corporation to get something back from it. I suggest, therefore, that this Clause is quite sound and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was very pleased, too, that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Orr-Ewing) also enjoyed himself, although I rather regretted the disagreement which

There is no intention on our part to offer anything in this Bill, or in any other Bill, which is a sop to the Tories; what we put in is what we believe to be a useful contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Clause is not capable of precise interpretation. It would not be, for instance, any precise guidance to an accountant. On the other hand, it is of some value to give a general indication of the intentions of Parliament that the Corporation should apply the ordinary economic criteria to their work, and should not be in a position to use public money, perhaps unfairly, in competition with private industry. All we are trying to do—and I put it no higher than this—is to give a rough guide to the members of the Corporation as to the way they shall operate. I agree, as I have said, that it is not precise, and that it does not bind the Corporation in any way, but I should have thought, if the right hon. Gentleman and his Friends were serious, that they would have tried to devise some form of words which would give Parliament closer control over the financial activities of the Corporation. I do not think this Clause is unnecessary; I agree that it is not binding the Corporation closely, but it is a rough guide, and, as such, is of real value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of these Amendments is to keep Parliament in control of the activities of the Corporation, where public funds are involved, at the stage where control can be properly exercised. I should perhaps qualify that by saying "get the approval of Parliament" rather than that Parliament should exercise direct control. This was raised by myself and others during the Second Reading. It was argued that it was quite sufficient for the Corporation to report to the President of the Board of Trade and for him to lay an annual report before Parliament. It was pointed out that that would be the occasion when criticisms could be made and questions asked. I pointed out that that meant that criticisms would be in the form of an inquest, and would occur too late in the life of the undertakings set up by the Corporation to be of any immediate effect. An embarrassing position would be bound to arise where public funds had already been invested, and a great deal of work had been done by the Corporation in developing something or other. It would obviously be the duty of the Corporation and of the Board of Trade to see to it that the expenditure of public funds was not wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we should get a position which is not unknown in local government matters. For instance, a local council may do certain things which mean an expenditure of public money. When the day comes for the local authority to go, the electors vote against these things, but it is practically impossible to scrub out the work which has been done, without involving a considerable loss. That is exactly the position in which Parliament will find itself in relation to these sort of activities. It is most important that the House should have the right to consider the proposed financial commitments before the Board of Trade pledge public funds. I hope no sinister intent can be read into these Amendments, but that they will be understood as being perfectly straightforward in maintaining the the rights and duties of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I thought we were taking both together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought, too, it might be convenient to discuss the two together, but I was proposing to provide an opportunity for a decision to be come to on each Amendment separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary the view that we hold on this subject. It is a matter of considerable importance that Parliament should retain some control over the expenditure visualised under this Clause. It is competent for this Corporation to indulge in activities the extent of which it is impossible to visualise in advance, save for the ultimate financial limitation. We passed over Clause 3 without perhaps commenting sufficiently upon the wide nature of the powers there allowed. It is competent for this Corporation, if it is convenient or advantageous to
	<br><blockquote><p>"… carry on, or promote or facilitate the carrying on by other persons, of any business."</p></blockquote>
That is an extremely wide power. I do not think it is the intention of the Government that this Corporation should have the opportunity, or that Parliament should be denied the opportunity, of deciding the extent to which a Government sponsored Corporation is to indulge in the ownership of new businesses. In Subsection (2, 
	<i>b</i>) mention is made of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of financial assistance to any person undertaking the development or exploitation of any invention;"</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2, c) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the acquisition of, or of any interest in, any undertaking."</p></blockquote>
These are singularly wide powers. The Parliamentary Secretary cannot tell us what limitation is to be put upon them, except for the financial limitation. If there is to be widespread indulgence in new organisations, widespread investment in existing companies, or the establishment of new companies, it should be done only by Affirmative Resolution of each House of Parliament. I hope this view is one which will commend itself to the Parliamentary Secretary. This is not a question of being niggardly: it is a matter
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
of principle that new businesses should not be set up by a Government without the authority of the House of Commons. In the circumstances, I hope that the Amendment to line 17 will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Opposition have now caught up to their briefs, and that we are able to discuss the two Amendments together. Hon. Members opposite are really trying to have it both ways. Not only did the Opposition propose, earlier, to subject the Corporation to all the legal provisions of the Companies Act, but now they are asking us to subject it to a new and stringent form of control under which no commercial company could survive for a month. The sort of transactions for which the Amendment would require Affirmative Resolution are those in which protracted and possibly delicate negotiations would be needed. They might relate to secret processes, or they might involve private details of the financial position of a company or individual. They might be effected by patent agreements extending outside this country, and they might turn on the closing of an agreement at short notice, for instance, before the end of a statutory term under patent law. If this Amendment were accepted, all these things would have to be discussed in Parliament, before they could be concluded, with the probability of delay and of the publication of details or reasons for a proposed transaction. That would not be right. I do not think it would meet the desires of the Government, in promoting this Bill, to subject the Corporation to a stringent procedure of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that there is no restraint except the financial one. There is also the limitation under Clause 1 (4). There is the limitation that the approval of the Board of Trade has to be sought. The Corporation will not be free from Parliamentary control. The President of the Board of Trade will be liable to answer Questions on any consent which he gives under this Clause. There is no doubt about that. We cannot have the argument, which we have heard so frequently lately, that the Corporation might be free from Parliamentary control because the President would not accept the responsibility for answering Questions in Parliament. There is no doubt that under this Clause the President is answerable
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
to Parliament. That gives Parliament sufficient control over the Corporation without unnecessarily hampering the Corporation in its work. I regard this proposal as unacceptable, and I hope that the Amendment will not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I have some further explanation? The Parliamentary Secretary specifically mentioned Clause 1 (4) in support of his argument that this idea of subjecting the expenditure or investment of public funds to the approval of Parliament is unnecessary. That Subsection refers to something other than the subject which we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation shall, except where it appears to them that special circumstances otherwise require, exercise their function of securing the exploitation of any invention by entrusting the exploitation thereof, on terms appearing to the Corporation to be appropriate, to persons engaged in the industry concerned."</p></blockquote>
That is the sort of activity which all hon. Members would approve. It is merely an undertaking on behalf of the Government that they will not exploit an invention unless they find that it cannot be exploited through the ordinary industrial processes of the country. We are talking about something quite different. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary realises that, as the Bill stands at the moment, it would be possible, though, I hope, not probable, that the Corporation, with the approval of the Board of Trade, could take the whole or a considerable part of the funds supplied to them in the first few years and invest them in a gigantic undertaking. I agree that the wording of this Amendment may not be satisfactory. Possibly a proviso should be put in that all sums should not be subject to Affirmative Resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament is entitled at least to claim information and the right to express an opinion as to whether the Corporation are justified in investing very considerable sums in any undertaking, or making any bulk payment which would account for a large proportion of the total amount of public funds available to them over a fixed period. The Parliamentary Secretary has not dealt quite fairly with that point. There are all sorts of similar cases where a Minister has to come to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
Parliament, where something is laid on the Table, and within a fixed time has to be given approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think his argument that we should be subjecting the Corporation to unlimited delays holds water for one moment. Nor do I think his argument that secrets will be disclosed, or that very careful negotiations might be upset by such procedure, holds water either. After all, we are getting rather near commercial practice in this proposal. I cannot believe that it is beyond the wit of the Corporation, or the Board of Trade, to carry negotiations for acquisitions portended in the Bill to the pbint where they could be set out in summarised form so that Parliament could say whether those negotiations were of the type which should or should not be included in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Finance Corporation for Industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Finance Corporation for Industry and the Industrial Financial Corporation are Corporations which are not using public funds. They are corporations set up to assist, not by means of public funds, but private funds,—funds already in the possession of the bank—in the financing of new enterprises which would not attract assistance because they come outside the ordinary case, which can go through the ordinary channels of commerce to get that assistance. This is an entirely different field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were any sort of analogy for this sort of thing, and the giving of quite such a free hand, I would think again about this matter, but I cannot see that there is. It has been admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary that a new form of structure is being set up here, with the President of the Board of Trade directly responsible. I am glad it is the case. It gets over a lot of difficulties which we have had in the past. But it is the duty of the President to fulfil his responsibilities to Parliament, and to keep Parliament informed where a sum of above so much is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to think again about this matter. It will land us in some awkward Debates when the annual report of the Board of Trade is laid before the House. Questions will be asked as to where the money
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
has gone. Why is it that we now find that, after two years, all the credits which should have accrued to the Corporation have been exhausted, because they have all been invested in one enterprise? I do not think we want to have that kind of inquest on activities over the last 12 months. It is better to safeguard the position step by step, and get approval as large sums are required. I agree that with small sums, it would be ridiculous, but when sums of above a certain amount are involved it would be better for Parliament, and better for the President, if we adopted something along these lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government would accept an Amendment in this form it would confine the necessity for getting Parliamentary sanction to these activities of the Corporation where they are about to produce goods for sale. They will be left completely free to exploit inventions, but would not be free, without the consent of Parliament, to carry on the business of manufacturing goods for sale. I know it is an antiquated doctrine, but I object to the Government competing with the taxpayer with the taxpayer's own money, without him having any say. That is not quite cricket. While the Corporation can play about as much as they like with the exploitation of inventions, there ought to be Parliamentary sanction before they engage in civil engineering contracts, or the manufacture of goods for sale, and so forth. The point is that it is not limiting the activities for which the Corporation was primarily set up, but if they manufacture for sale then we should have Parliamentary sanction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It should be limited to research or development only. It might be for sale or for the mass production of goods. The Parliamentary Secretary agreed earlier that there should be appropriate additions to paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) making it quite clear that this Corporation should concern itself only with research and development. Some of our fears will be removed if the Parliamentary Secretary could add words to the end of paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) which would limit what is proposed to be undertaken by this Corporation. Perhaps the words could be:

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be convenient to take this Amendment and the next one, in the same line, together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of this Amendment is to import a greater degree of Parliamentary control into the activities of the Corporation. I think we should be given an opportunity, after the Corporation have lost £2 million—which I certainly think they are likely to do—to have some Parliamentary control. It is, of course, possible for inexperienced people to go on to a racecourse and, with nothing but "Pizztey's late wire," to back a few winners. That may well happen to this Corporation, but if ever I saw an occasion when the set-up was more likely to lose money it is this one. Something, however, may turn up, and the Corporation may turn out all right. I know that millions, under the Socialist form of finance, have no longer the same significance as they used to have in the days of my great uncle, Mr. Gladstone, of blessed memory, but after the Corporation have lost a couple of million I think we ought to take a deep breath and have some Parliamentary control, to see whether they are to be given the remaining £3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment is consequential. I would impress upon the Committee that this is no desire to hamper the activities of the Corporation. The object is to increase Parliamentary control, and to go a little more deeply than would otherwise be possible into their preliminary financial losses, taking, of course, one year with another. I do not know how, in human life, it is possible to do otherwise than to take one year with another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment. The figure of £5 million was very carefully chosen after considerable consultation with a number of people, not all of one political shade of opinion, but people experienced in development and exploitation work, including members of the Parliamentary Scientific Committee. We must give the Corporation sufficient elbow-room if it is to do a useful job. It is with this in mind, and in the light of the opinion given by a number of experienced people, that it was felt that £5 million was the right amount. I fear that any reduction of the

	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
amount of money available to the Corporation in its early days may so severely restrict their operations as to reduce very considerably their degree of usefulness. I hope there will be no trouble about this. It is quite impossible for anyone to say precisely at this stage how much money will be needed in the early years, and it is probable that during the first part of the Corporation's operations they will require to spend money without an immediate return for the work which they are doing. Therefore, in order not to restrict the Corporation unduly, I hope the Committee will reject both Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir W. Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sorry on this side of the Committee to hear the Parliamentary Secretary ask for the rejection of what we consider to be a very reasonable request. After all, we are not saying that there should not be £5 million available. We say that after £2 million have been lost—which is a very different thing—the House of Commons should look into the whole matter. Five million pounds may be spent in developing certain inventions and exploiting certain research work which may be of extreme value. If we are lucky, that £5 million may produce assets of £7 million, or £10 million. The Amendment says that when £2 million had been lost the House of Commons should look into the whole question. That is not an unreasonable request. It does not mean that £5 million should not be spent. We hope it will produce very satisfactory results, but we say that when £2 million have been spent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: —have proved insufficient the matter ought to come before the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not feel that the picture drawn by the Parliamentary Secretary, of how he arrived at the figure of £5 million, is very convincing. The real object of the Amendment is to provide the opportunity for a sort of interim report, which would increase confidence in this new and very difficult venture. Two million pounds is a very large amount. If it is not to be used in the direct processes of manufacture—which, clearly, it is not to be—and is to be expended on scientific research and exploitation, £2 million, in my small experience of these matters, is a considerable sum, and should
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
provide sufficient time and field of development for the Corporation to be able to make an interim report. I do not say that during that time they would have been able to act in such a way from the financial point of view as to pay dividends. It would obviously be in a preliminary stage, in which they would be more or less classifying the sort of work which they felt best fitted to do, and canalising, to some extent, the financial resources and brains which they possessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Corporation, in their early working stages, on a very difficult matter like this, must be reinforcing themselves and clarifying their own ideas while, at the same time, acquiring much greater Parliamentary and public confidence. Therefore, if they are sufficiently wise when they get to a figure which is nearly 50 per cent. of the resources put at their disposal they will come forward with an interim report. In the development stage about £500,000 will have to be written off, and another £1 million will not show any return for four or five years; but the Corporation may have struck a certain number of things which are developing well. The Amendment provides the greatest possible safeguard by creating confidence in something which it is extremely difficult for the public to understand, and which, if it is to come to its best fruition, should have public confidence based on knowing—by an interim report before the Corporation come to the end of their resources, and ask for more—what has been done and what is being done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the first years are the most likely years during which there will be no immediate return, but I think that in view of the new Clause we have just accepted, £2 million could grow to a much larger figure. We have in the new Clause given the right, if not laid a duty on a Department to reimburse the Corporation for expenditure undertaken at the request of that Department. Therefore, we are not dealing with a limited sum but £2 million, plus expenses to be reimbursed by the Department. Quite a lot of the Corporation's expenses will be to the account of one or other of the Government Departments. I can see how an enormously heavy expenditure could be involved in connection, for instance, with atomic research, or something of that nature, which would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
chargeable to one Department or another. If that is the case, £2 million should be sufficient to go on for some time without return. After all, something should be coming back, and I should have thought that it would have been wiser, and have given more confidence in the Corporation among inventors, research workers, and Members of the House if something in the nature of an interim report, as suggested by the hon. Member for Bury (Mr. W. Fletcher) was issued, and the position was looked at quite fairly after the expenditure of £2 million, plus the very large amount which will be put to the account of Government Departments. I should have thought that a commonsense thing to do. It is quite a common thing in commerce, when a company is in the initial stages of a new enterprise which is novel to everyone, for it to present an interim report and for there to be an examination of the position. I strongly recommend the Parliamentary Secretary to look at this matter again. It is not as sinister as he may think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be persuaded by the arguments advanced in favour of the Amendment. I hope that when he looks at the difficulty which the Committee were in over the Amendment which we moved to Clause 4, he will appreciate that this Amendment provides an opportunity of exercising the type of control which the Committee may well feel that it is necessary for Parliament to exercise over the expenditure of money. If we lower the financial limit that can be expended without the intervention of Parliament, then I think the argument which he put forward about the undesirability of extending expenditure in new enterprises, without Parliament having given sanction, will to some extent have been met. I hope he will bear that in mind when considering whether he can accept the Amendment. Secondly, the expenditure of £5 million is by no means the total of the Government's expenditure on research. I believe that something like £60 million is spent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is getting a little wide of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blackburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain of the opinion that the correct figure ought to be £10 million, and not £5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is out of Order, as it comes on the Financial Resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blackburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then may I say that it should be £2 million, that I feel quite satisfied that it ought to be at least £5 million, and that the Amendment ought to be rejected for that reason? There are many members of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, who are certainly not Socialists or members of the Labour Party, who take the view that there should be as much capital as possible at the beginning in order to encourage the feeling Of enterprise. May I say to the right hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton) who, in moving the Amendment, spoke as though he expected Government corporations, and enterprises of that kind, to be singularly reckless, that the whole burden of the case of hon. Members opposite is that corporations in general are bureaucratic and too cautious? I am afraid that the tendency of this Corporation will he to be too cautious, and that if the Amendment is accepted it will increase that danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of saying that activities ought to be confined to £5 million, nor do Members of Parliament who are members of the scientific world rebut the idea that expenditure ought to be kept very carefully under Parliamentary control. It is not a matter of limiting the total amount, but of saying that the Corporation ought to come back to Parliament from time to time, so that we can keep a certain check upon its expenditure. We are dealing with a field which, taking all the other Government Departments together, may provide one of the largest sieves yet discovered by Socialists for throwing the taxpayers' money away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain quite unrepentant. While listening to some of the arguments of hon. Members opposite, I felt sure that two points had been overlooked. I believe they will not be regarded on the other side of the Committee with the same respect as they are on this side. After all, there is an element of Parliamentary control through the report presented annually by the Board of Trade to Parliament, when these matters can then be scrutinised. Further, nowhere in the Bill is it said that this £5 million is a fixed sum to be disposed of in the first
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
five years. It merely says that the Board of Trade, with the consent of the Treasury, may advance up to a maximum of £5 million outstanding at any time during that period. Those two points should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further point made twice by the hon. Member for Bury (Mr. W. Fletcher)—to whom I listened with respect, as I always doto his utterances—was that there was here a matter of confidence, and that it was important for the Corporation to retain the confidence of Parliament, the public and industry. I quite agree. But I am not so sure that pushing down this figure from £5 million to £2 million, and then compelling the Corporation to go to Parliament before they have permission to use any more, would not be likely to work the other way and inspire less confidence in the Corporation, because it might indicate to the general public that Parliament had not sufficient confidence in the Corporation to allow them to use up to £5 million, but intended to make the Corporation apply again after having reached, say, the limit set out in this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in the early stages of their operation the Corporation will desire to undertake some long-term projects for which they will have to permit themselves in the early days, not necessarily to spending the money straight away, but to spending it over a period of years; but the commitments will be there, and could not be undertaken unless the Corporation knew without any doubt that they would be able to meet their commitments as they became due. If we were in any way to hamper the Corporation by pushing down the £5 million to £2 million we may compel the Corporation to undertake short-term operations which would yield early dividends—if I may put it that way—but would be to the ultimate disadvantage of both the Corporation and the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that those are cogent arguments, and I hope the Committee will leave this figure as it is, because I am sure it is not necessary for the Corporation to take up all this money. When the report is presented by the President of the Board of Trade Parliament itself will have an opportunity of scrutinising all of these matters, including financial activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take up the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary when he referred to what I said. First, there was never any question of pushing down the £5 million to £2 million; it was simply a question of an interim report when that figure had been reached. The other argument used by the Parliamentary Secretary, on what would inspire confidence, was really most illuminating. I must deduce from what he said that confidence will be inspired by the amount of money spent rather than by the results—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, that is the logical conclusion; so that if £20 million or £25 million is spent there will be greater confidence, without judging on the actual results. If we think about what the Parliamentary Secretary said, that is the logical conclusion. I do not think he really thought about it, and I am certain he did not mean it. The sole means of creating confidence is to see how it is going when a reasonable sum has been expended. To leave it so that all the money is expended before the situation is reviewed is not the best way to inspire confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury (Mr. W. Fletcher). I go further and say that the Parliamentary Secretary was asserting that the less said about anything the greater confidence will people have in it. If that be the case, one might apply that to this Government, and say the less said about it the more confidence the people will have in them. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Well, that is a matter of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I or am I not right in thinking that the sums which can be recouped by the Corporation from the Board of Trade are not included in any way in this global aggregate amount of £5 million? I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that this £5 million, or £2 million, as the case may be, really bears little relation to the total amount expended by the Corporation during the period when they will be doing a considerable amount of work for the different Government Departments. Could he give us some enlightenment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1947-1948V003P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2) of the proposed new Clause states the case quite explicitly, and I do not think it is necessary for me to elucidate it any further:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The aggregate amount outstanding in respect of any advances made under this section shall not at any time exceed five million pounds."</p></blockquote>
To me that is as clear as daylight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that it will be, so to speak, a day to day payment on account from Government Departments? Otherwise, what is the meaning of the proposed new Clause? There must be a recovery from the Government Department. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how this will work, if his rather rough explanation just now means anything at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contained elsewhere in the Bill are provisions for the Corporation to repay to the Board of Trade amounts as and when the Corporation are able to repay those amounts, whether they earn the amounts by the exploitation of inventions they have taken over or by doing some work for the Government Departments under the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we are at cross purposes. I am talking about the new Clause [
	<i>Power of Government Departments to meet Corporation's losses on services provided for departments</i>]. I say that the £5 million does not include those payments which will be made from the Government Department direct to the Corporation. It cannot possibly include that, otherwise what is the meaning of this new Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how large those payments will be. It is obvious to me what those payments will be under the new Clause 5. They will be payments made probably in respect of medical research, or something of that kind, which is of social benefit. I imagine that the sums of money involved will be very small, but they will go into the general revenue of the Corporation; and under the later new Clause it would fall to the Corporation to pay to the Board of Trade those amounts which it was able to pay. The point about the discussion at this moment is that at no time must there be outstanding more than £5 million worth of loans by the Board of Trade to the Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Parliamentary Secretary elucidate this a little further? There is a substantial point here. Does the Parliamentary Secretary conceive that a Department like the Ministry of Supply might entrust this Corporation with research on its behalf, and might pay the cost of that research to the Corporation? If that is entirely excluded, then I see some point in leaving the £5 million alone. But I am quite uncertain whether that is so, and the last remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary left me in deeper doubt about it. Is not this really wide open? Or is that definitely excluded? Is it within the competence of the Ministry of Transport to pay this Corporation £X million to investigate whether sea water can be turned into petroleum? Is that included in the £5 million or not? Or can any Government Department advance any sums it likes—the Ministry of Health for food, and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the right hon. Gentleman is really in any doubt as to what all this means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyttelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Belcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It means that the £5 million figure applies to amounts advanced by the Board of Trade with Treasury sanction to the Development Corporation to enable them to carry on with their work. If a Government Department other than the Board of Trade decides to ask the Corporation to undertake a piece of development for them, and pays the Corporation for doing so, that sum is obviously not included in the £5 million. I should have thought that was quite clear. I do not envisage that the Corporation will be asked to undertake research or development to the extent of £X million; the Corporation will have quite enough to do with the job for which they are primarily set up in this Bill. Under the new Clause the £5 million is intended to cover, in the main, such things as medical research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
