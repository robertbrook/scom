	<p>
	<i>On resuming—</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to illustrate more fully the Opposition's view on the clause by copying the teachers' idea of using visual aids when the argument is too abstract for the class to handle. For example, when a teacher of primary one wants the class to grasp the idea that three minus two equals one he or she may use three apples, hide two and ask how many are left. I say that not to insult the intelligence of Conservative Members. We can all remember how Alec Douglas-Home admitted frankly and engagingly that he could not think about economics without taking our a box of matches and moving them around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite Conservative Members to imagine a small rural school with a small number of pupils and parents. To make it easy, let us imagine that those pairs of parents are called Lang, Rifkind, Forsyth, Hamilton—the laird, of course—Buchanan-Smith, Stewart and Walker. We could imagine two white settler families called Leigh and Howarth, and let us suppose that there is another couple called Irvine. That makes 10 sets of parents who between them might have 24 children, because 2.4 children per family is the norm. The couple called Irvine could organise a ballot to impose their wishes on the others. Could anything be more unreasonable than allowing the Irvines to impose their views on all the other moderate middle-of-the-road parents? That visual aid may help the Government to realise how unreasonable their intentions are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) makes a school board responsible for determining whether, at the date of signing a request, a parent had a child at the school. Considering the "Alice in Wonderland" wording of that subsection, Conservative Members had a nerve to complain earlier about the loose wording of one of our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) invites parents to decide whether a child was at school regardless of the reality. A child is either at the school or not. It is a fact or it is not a fact. How can parents decide whether a child was at the school? That relates to their eligibility to request a ballot. This is truly an "Alice in Wonderland" world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial question for the Minister to answer is, why 10 per cent.? Why not 20 per cent, as in England?
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
I know it would not be the same 20 per cent, as in England, but we shall discuss that later. I hazard a guess that far more schools have small numbers of pupils in Scotland than in England and Wales. All the islands have small numbers of children in primary schools, and there are isolated communities in the Highlands, in Orkney, the Shetlands and in the Borders. Therefore, the chances are that we have far more small communities with small numbers of pupils on the roll. In many cases there are nowhere near 300 pupils, but only a couple of dozen, or even less. No doubt hon. Members who represent rural areas can give details about that, but I am well aware that many schools have tiny numbers. So why are we getting 10 per cent, instead of the 20 per cent, that has been written into the English legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that she would comment on the English Act, but she will appreciate that its provisions for 20 per cent, broadly equate to the 10 per cent, provisions in this Bill. The English Act refers to 20 per cent, of the number of pupils registered at the schools, whereas this Bill refers to the number of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee could not work from the hon. Lady's example mainly because of the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), who has four children. On average there are two parents per child, although I accept that there will be some single parents and some children will have more than two parents because of the definition of "parent". However, a figure of 20 per cent, of the number of pupils registered at a school is equivalent to 10 per cent, of the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs.Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us. Under the English and Welsh legislation, a school with fewer than 300 pupils cannot opt out unless a request has been signed by the parents of at least 60 of the registered pupils. If that is so, how does that relate to the figure 10 per cent, of parents which will apply in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I have not studied the Education Reform Act 1988 with the same diligence as Labour Members. However, in that Act, the trigger which produces a ballot is 20 per cent, of the registered pupils. In this Bill, it is 10 per cent, of parents. One might argue that 20 per cent, of pupils is equivalent to 11 to 12 per cent, of the parents, but the figures are broadly in line. The hon. Lady's point relates to whether it is necessary to stipulate that a minimum number of parents must sign the request in a small school. In the Education Reform Act 1988, primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils are excluded. Labour Members tried to persuade the Committee to accept that provision in respect of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply shocked that the Minister can bring forward a Bill for Scottish education without having closely studied the Education Reform Act 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am equally shocked that the hon. Lady is speaking to an amendment which she
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
does not understand. She should speak to her hon. Friend and Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). It is another example of what I shall kindly call a mix-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is correct and I am wrong, closer examination of the amendment will show that. I am not convinced of his case and, in any event, 10 per cent, represents a small number of parents. It would be far more reasonable to fix the figure at 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) has tabled an amendment urging that the figure should be 25 per cent. Labour Members do not necessarily disagree with that, but it is important to explore why the Government will not accept that a larger number of parents should sign the request. As the Bill stands, in a very small school, one family could impose its wish to have a ballot of other parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my point. I shall give way later. In a very small school one family could impose its will, if the others are uninterested. Even if the school is double the size, two families may be able to impose their views. The figure of 10 per cent, will require that only an unreasonably small number of parents need to be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Lady's point about percentages. There is some confusion about whether 10 per cent, of parents equals 20 per cent, of pupils. The hon. Lady has also mentioned 25 per cent., but would she accept my way forward? In some schools, 10 per cent, may equal only 10 or 20 parents. Is it not sensible for the Minister to accept that we should stipulate the minimum number of parents who must sign the request. Twenty five per cent, of 100 still represents small number of parents. A fixed number is a more sensible way in which to approach the problem than percentages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with that because the size of schools in Scotland varies between those with very few children to those with several hundreds. A fixed number would not be helpful. If the hon. Gentleman was suggesting a sliding scale, that might be a useful idea, but he has not tabled an amendment to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still not convinced that the Bill's proposals are precisely the same as those contained in the English legislation. There is no confusion in my mind between 10 per cent, and 20 per cent., but the Education Reform Act 1988 requires a written request for a ballot signed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a number of parents of registered pupils at the school equal to at least twenty per cent, of the number of registered pupils at the school".</p></blockquote>
Ten per cent, is far too small a proportion, whatever the size of the school and whether it applies to one set of parents representing a tiny number of pupils or, proportionately upwards, representing a school with 300 pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can draw the attention of the hon. Lady to section 60(2) of the Education Reform Act 1988, which states that the requirements for initiating the procedure for the acquisition of grant-maintained status:
	<br><blockquote><p>"are that the request must be signed (or otherwise endorsed in such manner as the governing body may require) by a number of parents of registered pupils at the school equal to at least twenty per cent, of the number of registered pupils at the school on the date on which the request is received."</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Lady is suggesting that her amendment is designed to bring the Bill into line with the Education Reform Act, it does not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is getting more like "Alice in Wonderland" than ever. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) has just quoted to me a phrase that I uttered from the Education Reform Act not five minutes ago. However, to preserve some sanity let us return to the main point—that 10 per cent, of whatever number of pupils or parents there may be is far too small. It is not that we deeply disagree with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) which suggests the figure of 25 per cent.; our point is that 10 per cent, is far too low a figure and fails to take account of the fact that a tiny number of people could impose their view on all the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Lady's argument closely. She will, of course, concede that her argument is wholly different from the justification for the amendment put forward in the press release issued in the name of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It so happens that I have not read my hon. Friend's press release. Whatever it said, I am sure it made the point that 10 per cent, is far too small a proportion. Once again, Conservative Members are doing their best to evade talking about that issue— 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) should not do that from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now accepted three or four interventions, but none has addressed the point that 10 per cent, is far too low a figure. Let us wait and hope that, perhaps, we shall be fourth or fifth time lucky.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady think that the proportion for England and Wales is too low?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. gentleman will later explain to us why he believes that that is an appropriate proportion. I am still waiting. Four or five Conservative Members have still to tell us why the proportion seems to be appropriate. There is a difference between the two countries—we have far more small rural communities with tiny schools. The impact of the legislation on Scotland would be more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
intensive. Do Conservative Members disagree with the logic of that? The percentage would have a greater impact than in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to tread on sensitive ground, such as the press release, to which my more mischievious hon. Friends have referred. Will the hon. Lady answer the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) because it would help me to know whether she would be satisfied if the Bill contained the same provisions as the Education Reform Act 1988 on the number of parents required to sign a petition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used to be a teacher and I can recognise a red herring. I shall make the point for the fifth or sixth time that 10 per cent, is a small proportion for any school anywhere, but it is even more so in a small school with few pupils. Such schools are more common in Scotland than in England. Do Conservative Members deny that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The press release says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These amendments would bring the Bill into line with English and Welsh legislation."</p></blockquote>
I presume, with my secondary modern school education, that, to meet the press release, the amendment should fit with section 60(2) of the Education Reform Act 1988 for England and Wales. I presume that the amendment is to bring the Bill into line with legislation in England and Wales. Now the hon. Lady is saying that the percentage in the legislation for England and Wales is far too low. In that case, the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) should not issue statements to the press saying that the amendments will bring the Bill into line with English and Welsh legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are a bunch of slow learners. How many times do we have to tell them that our amendment is to explore with them the point that 10 per cent, is far too low? Are they ever going to get round to justifying that 10 per cent, for Scottish schools? The issue is as simple as that. If they concentrated their minds on that point we would get on much faster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way anymore on this matter. Conservative Members do not deal with the issue, so I do not want my time wasted further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Committee began its deliberations a few weeks ago I suggested that we should have a relief map of Scotland on the wall and a pointer for the benefit of hon. Members from English constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got into difficulties because that advice was not followed. We could have shown the vast areas of Scotland where the problem arises. We are still waiting to hear—I notice that no one is jumping up to intervene now—why Conservative Members think that 10 per cent, is an appropriate figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to give the hon. Lady an undertaking to amend the Bill to include the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
provisions as contained in the Education Reform Act 1988 would she be satisfied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How often do I have to tell Conservative Members that even if exactly the same proportions were required, Scotland would still have a greater problem because it has more rural areas and more tiny schools than England and Wales. Why do the Government want to impose that proportion in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It looks like we are getting more of the Dr. Forsyth medicine pushed down our throats. Dr. Forsyth knows what is good for us, we are going to get it whether we like it or not. He will take every opportunity, however unreasonable, to get schools to opt out, despite the fact that the people of Scotland did not vote for that. It was not even mentioned in the Scottish Tory manifesto. As the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) pointed out, the Scottish electorate were told that that would not happen but they are going to get it anyway because the Government are providing in the Bill that it will be possible to opt out even if a tiny proportion of 10 per cent, of parents, or even the absurdity of one set of parents, want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) will rehearse the somewhat weary argument about why we are attempting to improve the Bill or are even ready to discuss bringing it into line with England and Wales when we do not want it at all. The point is that although we do not want the Bill and see no reason why it should apply in Scotland, we will attempt to improve it in any way we can while we are discussing it in the Committee at 12.40 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When such ballots are organised by a tiny minority, however unreasonable that might appear, what guarantees are there that the parents involved will have all the consequences spelt out to them? What guarantee will prevent a school being hijacked by a well-organised minority group? We have had no answer to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not present in the Committee on Thursday morning as I was attending to other duties, but the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes described how standards had fallen since 1888 and offered his thoughts on the standards to which we should return. I find his arguments amazing. If he is urging that we should return to that type of teaching, I hope that his words will be publicised widely as they will serve parents with a clear warning of what they might be in for if a group of loony Right parents were to take over a school and were to impose the idea of what was appropriate to teach. Let me deal for example, with his notions of teaching history. He mentioned a test in 1888 that inquired what happened on various dates. The year of 1314 was when the battle of Bannockburn took place and I ask the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes to explain what point there is in knowing that that was the event that occurred in that year without also knowing who led what forces against whom, why the battle was significant or what was changed by its result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the date of 1603 when the Union of the Crowns took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
Again, there is no point in a pupil being able to rattle off a particular date. What is significant is that pupils should know what had happened to the line of succession to the English throne that had created that event and what impact it had on each country. A modern student of history does not merely rattle off dates. For example, pupils studying the 14th century will learn how Scottish people lived at the time, how they earned their keep, in what they believed and the limits of their knowledge at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have not finished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will learn what were their pastimes, why the average length of the life was lower than it is for people today, how the Scottish economy fared, what goods were sold to England and other European markets and what was bought from Scotland? That is real history, not the mere rattling off of dates, and that is the type of history that is taught today in modern schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I did not want to stray from the point at issue. I wanted to illustrate how, if one couple want a school to opt out because they have lunatic ideas about the teaching of history, for example, which they share with the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, it is important that the other parents realise what they are up to. We can illustrate the point by talking about the contrast between his idea of teaching history and the general consensus among history teachers today about how to teach the subject. We can do the same with the teaching of arithmetic and mathematics or the other subjects that he mentioned. However I shall not try your patience, Mr Martin, by asking the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes what point there is in children being able to do long arithmetical problems when they now have a calculator to help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes was trying to make that this traditional education instilled a rigorous logical mind, signs of which have been absent from the hon. Lady's speech?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this time of night I can hardly remember my phone number. However, to respond to the point made by the hon.

It is merely a training in the ability to remember dates and does nothing for their capacity to understand what was going on in those periods. That was the point that I was making about the proper teaching of history which involves teaching the why and wherefore of what happened on those dates and the consequences. The actual date on which something happened scarcely matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another date that I could test the hon. Gentleman on, but I shall resist the temptation. I have been trying to make a simple, straightforward point which all Conservative Members should be able to see. Why do they think that 10 per cent, is an appropriate figure for schools in Scotland? Will they please tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 131, which has been linked with amendment No. 69. It might help Conservative Members to know that I have not picked up the figure from section 60(2) of the Education Reform Act 1988, or GERBIL as it has become known. I selected a figure that is much more representative. The amendment would provide that 25 per cent, of parents who were entitled to vote at the date of the last election of parent members to a school board would need to sign a declaration to start the procedure for the school's self-governing status. That is not an unduly difficult figure for members of the Committee to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disagree with the figure of 20 per cent., but 25 per cent, is more realistic. After all, we generally look to a two thirds majority being required to implement a change in the constitution of an organisation. There must be a strong and clear demand for any major change to be brought into effect. By requiring that a quarter of those involved should sign such a resolution, it would be effective and would avoid the possibility of a takeover of a school by a specific cabal. Parents genuinely fear that a specific group of people, which is perhaps more active and vocal than another group, will attempt to start the self-governing procedure for reasons other than educational ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
I am sure that the Minister hopes that an argument that is propounded in favour of self-governing schools would be based on sound educational needs instead of on narrow political viewpoints. I do not mean party political viewpoints, but political in the broadest sense of the word. The amendments demonstrate our belief in the democratic process. By any standard, 10 per cent, is a small figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that smaller schools will be exempted from the provisions, and that he will be looking for a different percentage of parents. But given that a substantial number of primary schools have just over 300 pupils, it means that just over 60 parents can start the ball rolling without the full consultation process having taken place. The amendments are even more important given that the amendment affecting special schools was accepted earlier and the Minister has not yet explained how the procedure would start in those circumstances. If he were thinking of a figure of 10 per cent, for special schools, it would be ludicrous as most of them are so small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason for the figure of 25 per cent, is that the National Association of Schoolmasters and the Union of Women Teachers—an important union to which the Minister does not often refer, perhaps because it is small—finds it more acceptable than the figure of 10 per cent. I hope that Conservative Members will consider the democratic aspirations behind amendments Nos. 69 and 131 and not subject us to too many jocular speeches. They must justify the Bill providing such a small figure as 10 per cent. I, along with the National Association of Schoolmasters and the Union of Women Teachers, do not believe that it can be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations have written to us to say that the figure is far too small. The onus is on Conservative Members to give us a logical explanation of why such a small percentage of parents should be placed in the privileged position of starting the ball rolling for the acquisition of self-governing status. I am looking forward to hearing their arguments as they will have great difficulty justifying the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the reasonable and straightforward speech of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing). Unless I have misread the Bill—I am always willing to accept that possibility—the 10 per cent figure refers to parents who sign the request for the ballot. In my experience, people who request ballots do not always win them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been the general experience of the Tories in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That has been known to happen. Both Conservative and Labour Governments have called ballots and lost. It is the not the calling of the ballot that is important, but what happens in the ballot. If 10 per cent, of parents are worried and upset about what is happening in the school, they should have the opportunity to have a ballot. I hope that that covers the point made by the hon. Member for Moray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
I turn to the astonishing presentation on behalf of the Labour party. The introduction of the matter of English legislation did not come from the Conservative Benches, but from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) in her remarks, preamble, or whatever we like to call it. We tried to get her to explain clearly what she meant. There was a ghastly mix-up not for the first time today—but the hon. Lady replied with a degree of her usual provocative feminine approach. That is not a quality to which I object. There was fire and thunder when she said that 10 per cent, was not enough. She did not respond to the questions from the Conservative Benches, so how did that relate to her observations, comments and reasons for moving the amendment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable in debate to respond to what someone says is the reason for an amendment. There was a mix-up. I could call it something else, but because an hon. Lady moved the amendment, I would not use the sort of "up" that I had in mind, although I am sure that the Committee knows exactly what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, there was publicity in the press. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) claimed that the amendment, on which the hon. Member for Maryhill had not been properly briefed, would bring the Scottish legislation into line with English legislation. Anyone with even a minimum understanding of the mathematics would know that 10 per cent, of parents covers roughly 20 per cent, of children at the school, as there are two parents for every child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The average family size in Britain is frequently quoted as being 2.4 children per pair of parents and not one child, so I think that it is the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) who is confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recollect that when the hon. Lady was floundering, the hon. Member for Fife, Central concurred that our mathematics were about the same. If mine are wrong, so are those of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of a lack of co-ordination, preparation and organisation, the Labour party moves amendments that are not related to what it seeks to achieve. I hope that when my hon. Friend the Minister replies, he will bear in mind that peculiar presentation. It seems to be a matter of the Opposition tabling an amendment and claiming that it is one thing, and then perhaps another. I hear them saying, "We might even vote against it. We do not know." It looks to me like another example of the Opposition speaking and voting against their amendments. The amendment as it stands, and the case put for it by the hon. Lady, cannot be sustained. It falls flat; she could not support it because she had not been properly briefed. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give it the robust response that it deserves and send it away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment requires arithmetical ability, which is difficult to muster at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
this time of the morning; it is difficult for the Government at any time. In 1979, 1983 and 1987 they were incapable of interpreting the results of the ballot in Scotland and thought that they had been given a mandate for legislation of this type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not looked in depth at the Education Reform Act that applies in England and Wales. My starting point in relation to this amendment is new clause 1 which the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) attempted to introduce into the School Boards (Scotland) Bill. I understand that it was based on the Education Reform Act. The new clause sought to introduce a written request for a ballot from a number of parents of registered pupils at a school equal to at least 20 per cent, of the number of registered pupils. For a school of 500 pupils, 100 parents would have to request a ballot before it was granted; for a school of 1,000 pupils, 200 parents would have to make the request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But can the hon. Gentleman remember his own telephone number?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman always makes the comment that one would expect from him— irrelevant to the debate. As I was saying, 20 per cent, of 1,000 is 200. That was the proposal of the hon. Member for Eastwood on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is roughly equivalent to the provisions in the English Act. Will the hon. Gentleman answer my hon. Friend's question: is he prepared to accept the provisions in the Education Reform Act being implemented in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just coming to that point. I gave way to the hon. Member for Eastwood to allow him to confirm my figures. This Bill provides that the request should be signed by
	<br><blockquote><p>"a number of parents of pupils in attendance at the school equal to at least ten per cent, of the number of parents"</p></blockquote>
whose names were on the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a school of 500 pupils, if the number of parents required were to be equal to 20 per cent, of the number of registered pupils, the figure would have to be 100, but under the Bill the number of parents will be 100 only if every child in the school has two parents. The Minister, therefore, is suggesting that between 50 and 100 parents have to make the request before a ballot can be held. That contrasts with the proposal of the hon. Member for Eastwood that 100 parents would have to request a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's figure is therefore lower than that of the hon. Member for Eastwood, and also lower than was suggested for English and Welsh legislation. It could be the same only if every child in the school had two parents, but nowadays there is an increasing number of single parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That factor would be counterbalanced by parents who had, say, three pupils in the school. Would the hon. Gentleman agree that, given 2 or 3 per cent, either way, the provisions in the Education Reform Act are of the same size as those in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the Bill, it does not matter whether a parent has three children or one child at the school. The new clause to the School Boards (Scotland) Bill which the hon. Member for Eastwood tabled simply referred to the fact that the number of parents who make a written request for a ballot must be at least 20 per cent, of the number of registered pupils. Under the Minister's proposal the important point is not the relationship between the parents and the number of pupils, but only that the number of parents making the request equals 20 per cent, of the number of registered pupils. That is all that matters under the admendment. The Minister is saying that 10 per cent, of the number of parents is the important factor, not the number of registered pupils. My understanding is that a smaller number of parents would be required to apply for a ballot than under the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Eastwood to the School Boards (Scotland) Bill or under the Education Reform Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland a larger number of parents should be required to request a ballot. In England and Wales the requirement is 20 per cent., but there is a further provision that small primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils cannot opt out unless the number of parents who sign the request equals at least 60 per cent, of the number of registered pupils. That overturns the 20 per cent, requirement, but is not available in Scottish legislation. The Minister argued that every school, irrespective of size, should be covered by the provision in the Bill, but it was conceded that small schools in England and Wales should have separate arrangements. The Minister has not conceded that in the Bill before us, and that is why it is necessary to introduce the protection in the amendment. That is the important point that I am trying to get across to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland there are many small schools and even in cities there are primary schools with only 100 pupils. Under the Minister's prescription of a 10 per cent, requirement, a school with 150 pupils would require only 15 parents to request a ballot. The hon. Members for Tayside, North (Mr Walker) said that the request for a ballot is not important and that it is the ballot that is crucial. But Opposition Members had the bitter experience of a Labour Prime Minister deciding not to go to the country in 1978 and waiting until 1979. There was a significant difference holding that ballot in 1978 and later in 1979. The same principle may apply under the Bill. If only 15 parents exercise their right, a school may opt out, but if a larger percentage were required, that may not happen. The historical circumstances are different, and timing and the percentage are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not duplicated in the Bill the provisions in the legislation covering England and Wales. A smaller number of parents will be able to request a ballot and there will be no exemptions in Scotland, although there will be exemptions in England and Wales. The differences are substantial and it is important that the matter is considered before the amendment is allowed to slip through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed with interest what the hon. Members for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
and for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) said. There is an element of judgment in the matter of the percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) is not in the Committee. I was genuinely going to congratulate her because she said that she does not read the press releases of the hon. Member for Fife, Central, which probably results in her having a better perception of what the amendments mean than would otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Dundee, East has rightly said, the provisions are not identical in the two measures. Given a few percentage points, and depending on how family sizes are interpreted, they are roughly of the same order of magnitude, but they are not identical. My hon. Friend the Minister may wish to return to his offer to the hon. Member for Maryhill to bring the two pieces of legislation into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being presented with two different arguments from the Labour party, but not from the hon. Member for Moray. Setting out his position in his press release, the hon. Member for Fife, Central said that amendment No. 69 would bring the Bill into line with the English provisions. That is not the case; the amendment would do no such thing. It would mean that the Bill was substantially out of line with the English provisions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North said, both measures are roughly in line at present. This is a remarkable saga, in that none of the amendments would achieve the objectives that were claimed for them in the famous press release and press conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to see the hon. Member for Fife, Central present. It is a relatively unusual occurrence. Will he tell us whether the Labour party believes that the two measures should be brought into line? That is a perfectly reasonable and arguable proposition. Or does it accept the position of the hon. Member for Maryhill that the English Act is wrong because there is not a sufficiently high trigger, so the trigger should be higher in Scotland? That is also an arguable proposition. But one cannot take both positions—it has to be one or the other. I shall be fascinated to see which position the Labour Front-Bench spokesmen will take on the matter before the end of this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly, and hope to encourage others to speak. I hope that the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) is not about to leave the Committee Room, as I am going to refer to his suggestion. I disagreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) when she said that she did not wish to pursue the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, because there is potential in it. He was pointing to our genuine concern that for certain school sizes, stipulating a percentage, whatever it is, could result in having such a small number of parents as to make matters nonsensical. For small schools in small communities, such a stipulation could make for a divisive and unhealthy atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish not only to echo our concerns that 10 per cent, is not large enough, but to encourage the hon. Member for Hexham to pursue his suggestion. For example, an amendment could be tabled requiring
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
either a minimum number of parents or a minimum percentage to sign the request, and whichever number was larger could trigger the ballot. In small schools, the minimum number might be higher than the total number of parents. In such cases, a reasonable requirement might be that the request be unanimous. I stress that 10 per cent, is too low and I expect that Conservative Members will share my view. I hope that the hon. Member for Hexham will pursue the matter with the Minister so that we can make genuine progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made one of the more constructive contributions to the debate.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I was listening to other speeches I was trying to think of a suitable number. If the Minister is showing an interest in taking up my idea at a quarter past one in the morning, perhaps my hon. Friend would agree to withdraw the amendment so that new amendments can be tabled on Report. That would allow the Minister to consult the hon. Member for Hexham and arrive at a suitable number. That would be a reasonable solution from which we could all derive satisfaction. As the Minister has expressed an interest in the possibility, I hope that he will undertake to consider it further and table constructive amendments on Report</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be something in what the hon. Member for Western Isles has said, but, inevitably, it is incumbent on all members of the Committee to suggest ideas to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Western Isles, at least, is prepared to get himself off the hook that the rest of his party have been on today. I have been considering the ways in which the Labour party swings round on the issue of whether the Bill should, or should not, be different from English legislation. 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 22 November 1988 quotes the hon. Member for Fife, Central as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Despite Rifkind's claim to the contrary, they"—</p></blockquote>
the Government—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are transferring the English prescription to Scottish education. This may or may not be a solution for English schools but it is certainly a transfer of an alien educational philosophy which is not rooted at all in the Scottish educational tradition."</p></blockquote>
By 6 April, the hon. Gentleman is quoted in the same newspaper as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If he"—</p></blockquote>
my hon. Friend the Minister—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is applying the English prescription—let's have all of it."</p></blockquote>
Thankfully, the hon. member for Western Isles has extricated himself sensibly from those two statements in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> and from the unfortunate press release, which has probably been given more publicity than Opposition Members intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) mentioned one point that is worth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
bearing in mind. Whatever figures that we may come up with, we are talking not about the ballot itself but about the trigger mechanism. Once we clear away the fog and fudge, the general argument of the hon. Member for Moray and some Opposition Members is that the trigger mechanism is not high enough, that the fence is too low and that it should be made a little more difficult. That is an interesting proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Member of Parliament representing the port of Immingham, I wondered why only 60 delegates at the Transport and General Workers Union conference this morning should be able to decide whether to call a ballot for the 9,400 registered dockers. Then I began to understand what Members on the Opposition Benches were getting at. Ultimately, parents will decide through the ballot. However low the threshold—we could argue ad nauseam about that—and however small the number of trade union officials who decided on a ballot for the 9,400 registered dockers, I appreciate the general point that the Opposition are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the responsibility of those of us in the Committee who are interested in the ideas of my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) and of the hon. Member for Western Isles, and who believe that the Government may not be right, to present alternatives for debate. I do not know now that should be done. Perhaps we should listen to my hon. Friend the Minister and decide whether it is possible for him and other members of the Committee to table amendments on Report. We may be able to have informal and formal discussions between now and then on whether a compromise is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the principle of the amendment. I wish to clear up a point, without being provocative at this late hour, in the apparent spirit of glasnost that appears to be evolving slowly but surely. The press release has been discussed at length today. The more that it is raised, the more pleasure that one takes in knowing that many issues were discussed in the Scottish press last week without the Government's participation. It is always satisfying to know that when something genuinely hurts, it is often used in a major attack, such as that which I have endured today. That is part of the rich tapestry of parliamentary life and good luck to hon. Members on the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) said, we are talking not about the ballot, which is a step further down the line, but about the process of starting the self-governing procedure. The hon. Members who have spoken would be prepared to consider what the percentage might be. It might be not a percentage, but a figure that would trigger a ballot relative to the size of the school involved. In the absence of an agreement, or support from the Government for the amendment that would remove primary schools with less than 300 pupils from the eligibility criteria it becomes more pressing that the issue be tackled. It would not be reasonable or fair for us to suggest the number of parents that would trigger a ballot, if a figure was required, but the
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
current 10 per cent, is insufficient to ensure at the start of the process that any desire to hold a ballot is representative of a group of parents. We want the Minister to examine without commitment the possibility of a more representative level of parents being involved at that crucial stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In view of the constructive points that have been made about the Scottish Bill and a fairer proportion of parents, will the Minister give a commitment—probably not—to examine the amendment so that the points made by the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That press briefing has clearly hurt the Government, but we should return to the reality of the Bill before us. The Government continue to attempt to score political points at 1.30 am. Is the Minister willing to rise above the knockabout and assure us that the simple measure to debate the percentage, trigger point or whatever he wants to call it will be considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to be helpful and respond to arguments. The hon. Gentleman spoke in favour not of the amendment but of my thinking of an alternative to the provisions in the Bill. Despite repeated attempts to get the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and the hon. Gentleman to say what they want, I have had no response. I have lost interest in the press release of the hon. Member for Fife, Central. If he thinks that it hurt the Government, will he please issue more press releases? He said that he took pleasure in issues being discussed without Government participation. Presumably, that is because he has no confidence in the strength of his arguments. If the Government's position appeared in the same article, it would undermine his argument.

If the hon. Gentleman is serious about amending the Bill, he should give me guidance on how he would like me to change the provisions relating to the number of parents required to sign a petition to start the balloting process. I am content with the provisions in the Bill—it is for him to make a case. The hon. Gentleman argued that the required number should be greater. I asked whether he would be content with a form of wording that reflected the provision of the Education Reform Act 1988 and I expected him to say yes, because he has been quoted extensively as saying that he wished to bring the Bill into line with that Act. Despite repeated requests on my part, the hon. Gentleman has not said what he wants. I hope that he will now tell the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some interesting suggestions have been made by both sides of the Committee. We proposed 20 per cent, in the belief—I say this without being over-cynical—that that is the maximum that the Government would concede. Better suggestions have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles and by the hon. Members for Hexham and for Brigg and Cleethorpes. The Minister should respond to the positive proposals that have emerged. It would not be useful to suggest a figure, in view of the excellent arguments that we have heard about the size of school and the trigger point. It is for the Minister to consider those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Opposition have not clarified their position. The case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham has nothing to do with that made by the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend argued that in very small schools, whatever the percentage was—whether it was 10 per cent, or 20 per cent.—it might result in a small number of parents triggering the ballot process. He pointed out that the Bill is not equivalent to the Education Reform Act 1988, in so far as it provides automatically for schools with fewer than 300 pupils to go for self-governing status. Thus, my hon. Friend was arguing not for a change in the trigger of 10 per cent., but for a floor provision for the number of parents in the case of very small schools. I am happy to give the Committee an undertaking to come back on Report with a proposal to meet that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Maryhill and for Fife, Central dealt with the percentage of parents required to trigger the ballot process. The cause of the difficulty—which may explain why Opposition Members have not answered the question that I put to them repeatedly—is that, on the evidence of what has been said publicly in the press release and elsewhere, there is at least a prima facie case that the Opposition believed that in seeking 20 per cent., they were replicating the position in the Education Reform Act 1988 and did not appreciate that the provisions were broadly in line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just coming to the hon. Gentleman's argument. He was right to say that the test in the Bill is not as strong as the test in the Education Reform Act. Like the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
Maryhill, I shall give an illustration, as it may help to crystallise thinking on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were 100 pupils on a school roll, there would be fewer than 100 families, because of siblings. If we assume that there are 75 families and 150 parents, 20 per cent, of the pupils would equal 20 parents, which would be 13.5 per cent, of all the parents, so the test set out in the Education Reform Act requires a marginally greater percentage of parents. If we are arguing about a difference of a few per cent., I shall reconsider that, but when we pressed the Opposition, they wriggled. It is extremely difficult to know exactly what they want me to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has moved a long way from the point on which I tried to intervene earlier. He kept asking whether the Opposition would agree to the provision of 20 per cent, of pupils, as enshrined in the Education Reform Act. Also enshrined in that Act is a provision that small primary schools should be exempt. Is the Minister offering that, too? If so, we accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham in respect of small primary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister speak to the Committee, not to his hon. Friends. We cannot hear what the Minister says because he is mumbling to Conservative Back Bench Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the hon. Gentleman claims that he cannot hear explains many of the contributions that we have had to endure from him today. We have repeatedly answered his points, but he continues to get up and make them again, as if that adds strength to an argument that lacks logic and coherence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham spoke about small schools and the difficulties that arise from having a straight percentage. I am happy to give an undertaking in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What undertaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already given an undertaking that I will consider the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham has made and come back with a proposal on Report. Had the Opposition come forward with an acceptable proposal, I should have considered it. It is for the Opposition to make proposals and to argue for them, but they have not said what they would like me to do. The amendment would go well beyond the provisions of the Education Reform Act in terms of the percentage of parents required. I expect that that is because the Opposition misunderstand the position. I am happy to give an undertaking on very small schools, but see no reason
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
to move from the 10 per cent, overall figure. If the Opposition are unhappy about that, they must accept that they have given me no proposal to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering the suggestion of the Member for Hexham, will the Minister also consider that a floor number may not be appropriate for some smaller schools, for which it may make sense to require a unanimous request to hold a ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be appropriate, in a small school below a certain size, for the ballot procedure not to be triggered by petition, but to require a decision by the school board. I shall consider the possibilities and come back with a proposal. In the absence of any guidance from the Opposition as to whether they want us to replicate the provision in the Education Reform Act 1988, which is what they told the Scottish people a few days ago, I do not see why I should change the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Opposition Members have studied the Bill and considered the arguments, they may want to table another amendment on Report. Obviously, we would consider it at that time, but in the meantime, I accept that the arguments of the hon. Member for Western Isles and my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham about small schools are valid, and I am happy to give an undertaking that the Government will put forward proposals to plug that gap in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members want to rejoin this debate because the Government always accuse us of not responding to the arguments. Amendment No. 69 proposes that 20 per cent, of parents must sign the petition. That is a positive suggestion and we want the Minister to deal with it. Good arguments have been put forward about the safeguards that might be required for small primary schools but the Minister cannot get away from the fact that the amendment would increase the percentage required to sign from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. The hon. Gentleman proposes that the requirement should be for 20 per cent, of parents to sign the request. Will he acknowledge that that takes the provision well beyond the Education Reform Act 1988, and is a change of view on his part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the knockabout of Committee it may take some people a long time to realise what we are proposing. There is a Scottish saying that one should never look a gift horse in the mouth. We are offering the Minister a chance to make the process of attaining self-governing status more democratic and representative. This is a sensitive issue, especially as it concerns the special needs provision, and our amendment would require more parents to express, in the Minister's view, a legitimate desire to begin the process for taking that school out of the education authority sector. We do not want a tremendous increase in the number of parents required to sign, just a doubling of the number required by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister makes a reasonable point about arguments. We highlighted accountability and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
representativeness of petitioners. The English experience has been well covered in newspapers such as 
	<i>The Independent, The Guardian</i> and 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement,</i> which show the huge concern about opting out. The Schools that have decided to opt out have had substantial majorities in the two-ballot system; if the first ballot does not achieve 50 per cent, of those eligible to vote a second ballot is held. We shall return to that matter in the days that lie ahead. The important process of acquiring self-governing status should have the support of a representative cross-section of the parents in the community. Of the amendments that we moved today, this is the most modest. It would establish a more substantial and secure foundation for the process of acquiring self-governing status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a specific proposition. The Minister suggested that if we came up with an idea, he would listen. Our amendment states a specific number of parents. Clearly, if we withdrew the amendment, we would require nothing more from the Minister than a commitment—that is perhaps too strong a word— or a suggestion that he and his advisers will consider the matter and that they will take on board the specific, but qualitatively different, point made by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>1.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment, did he believe that it would bring the Bill into line with the Education Reform Act 1988?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me if I have a wry smile, but the Minister may not have exhausted that point. I have been a Member for only two years, but today has been an interesting and illuminating parliamentary experience. The Minister insults our intelligence by repeatedly asking whether we think that the amendment will bring the Eill into line with the English legislation. In reality, we are debating a Scottish Bill and the Minister is faced with a specific suggestion. I hope that he will respond to that. Our aims are reasonable, but we are looking for a wider but different assurance from that given to the hon. Member for Hexham. The parental base necessary for acquiring self-governing status should be more substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have understood the point about the Education Reform Act 1988 and the hon. Gentleman's position on that. If the Government tabled amendments that brought the Bill into line with that Act, would that satisfy the hon. Gentleman? If that is so, we could resolve the difficulty to which the hon. Gentleman keeps referring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The nature of the game has, regrettably, altered. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) continually reminds me, the substantial concessions built into that Act by the Secretary of State for Education and Science mean that the game is different for this Bill. If the Minister had responded to earlier amendments and given assurances and made concessions, the points
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
that I now make would have had a different complexion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken decisions on many other issues and that is their democratic right. We are now left with the issue of the size of the parental base necessary for self-governing status. The Opposition would like to see something better than 20 per cent, but, being realistic, our amendment states that 10 per cent, is not a sufficient number of parents to sign the request. We put forward the figure of 20 per cent.—it has been debated elsewhere by other organisations—and we hope that the Minister will say "Yes, there is an element of reason in that" and that he will consider it. We do not expect the Minister to go further than that. Alternatively, if the Minister says that the case has not been made and his mind and instincts have not been changed, we shall consider pushing the amendment to a Division. The issue may not be important in the totality of the Bill, but it is important in terms of the anxieties that we expressed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful for the Minister to respond. If he does not, it may be best to press the amendment to a Division unless my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East wishes to complement my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his major contribution to the debate, the Minister claimed that if there was a difference between the Bill and the Education Reform Act 1988, it was only marginal. But it is not marginal in terms of the number of parents required to initiate a ballot. If he thinks that it is, he either has not read the Bill properly or does not understand its implications or those of the Education Reform Act. The Minister berates other hon. Members for not listening to what he says. Clearly, the Minister does not listen to what I say because, earlier, I explained the position of a school with 500 pupils where, under the provision of the Education Reform Act that the number of parents required must equal 20 per cent, of registered pupils, a minimum of 100 parents would be required before the ballot procedure was initiated. The Minister will agree with me on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes no reference to the number of registered pupils in the school; it refers to the number of parents. Therefore, under the Bill a school with 500 pupils would require a minimum of between 50 and 100 parents before the ballot procedure was initiated. Nobody can say exactly what the figure would be. It is unlikely that all the parents at a school would be single parents, so the figure of 50 is unlikely. However, it would be a figure between 50 and 100 and whether or not it was marginal would depend on the circumstances of individual schools. The Minister cannot claim that it would be marginal just because he wants it to be marginal. It must be looked at on a school-by-school basis and there may be some schools where there would be a significant difference between what is required under the Bill and what is required under the Education Reform Act. The Minister should concede that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an absurd intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). He suggested that in a school with 75 families there would be 150 parents. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
assumes that the 75 families would all be two-parent families. There is no such thing as single-parent families in the Minister's understanding. That may be the case in his immediate social circle, but he is expected to take on responsibility for the whole of Scotland and he should know that the number of single parents is increasing. That has an impact upon the provisions of the Bill and he should take that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members continually pressed my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) on whether we would accept the provision under the Education Reform Act for a figure of 20 per cent, of registered pupils. We would find that attractive only if it were linked to the other provisions in the Act which exclude all primary schools with 300 or fewer pupils from that provision. If the Minister is making that offer, we can end the debate now and we shall all go away glad to know that every primary school in Scotland with 300 pupils or fewer will be exempted from the clause. The Opposition would be happy to accept that. Of course, that is not what the Minister is offering. He is offering one element of the Education Reform Act without the other element which complements it. That makes a substantial difference to how the measure will be applied in Scotland compared with how it is applied in England and Wales. If he does not know that, he does not deserve to be in the position that he currently holds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is asking us to accept that he will take away, and consider the suggestion of the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) and bring it back on Report. As I understand the suggestion, it involves a combination of a minimum percentage and a minimum number which would be applied differentially, depending on the rolls of the schools concerned. Where a school had a particularly small pupil roll, the percentage rule might be applied. Where a school had a higher number of pupils the minimum number might apply. Where a school had an even higher number of pupils, there might again be a minimum percentage requirement. We do not know exactly what we are being asked to accept. There is no suggestion of what the minimum percentage or number would be. The Minister is simply going to go away and look at the suggestion on that basis we are expected to trust that he will always make decisions in the best interests of parents and pupils in schools throughout Scotland. Anyone who believes that does not live in Scotland. The only people who might believe it are the English members of the Committee, who obviously do not know what they are talking about when they speak of Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllister) to put on the record what I have undertaken to do. I have undertaken to take up the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) has made about the small number of parents who would be involved in requisitioning a ballot in very small schools and to find a way round that. I make no commitment as to the means of achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a constructive speech, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) proposed a variety
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
of possible approaches. We shall examine all of them and return with our proposals on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has made it clear that the three amendments represented a sort of package deal or three-legged stool. The stool would fall over if one leg were missing, so on that basis—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that, on that basis the entire package has been blown up during the course of our proceedings today. It would be unwise of me to make any suggestions in respect of what remains of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am content to recommend the clause as drafted to the Committee with the undertaking that I have given to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a regrettable response. My hon. Friends and I attempted fully to explain the valuable point, which was not conceded but taken on board by the Minister, in relation to very small schools which may have specific problems relating to not only balloting, but what was described as the trigger mechanism. Therefore, it is regrettable that on the key issue of the basis of parental support required for a petition to be started we have again come up against the proverbial brick wall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) pointed out, a provision for a primary school with fewer than 300 pupils to be taken out of eligibility would have made the suggestion in the Education Reform Act acceptable to us. But I believe that the Minister will concede that the demise of that proposal changes the nature of what we are trying to achieve in establishing a broader base of parental interest in all schools, including special needs schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. If he reads the Education Reform Act he will find that the Secretary of State has power to reduce the figure of 300 by regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I am aware, there are no provisions which deal with numbers of the kind that I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham. In so far as it would be possible under the terms of the Education Reform Act for primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils to become self governing, without any provision of the kind that I advised my hon. Friend I would include, the hon. Gentleman's argument does not stand up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not continue to embarrass the hon. Member for Hexham by mentioning him in dispatches. He raised a constructive point, the Minister dealt adequately with the whole of that area of provision and my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles contributed to that solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the matter of the parental base for all schools which are eligible to opt out. If the context of the debates of yesterday and this morning were still live, the question of the provisions of the English Reform Act—The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) looks puzzled, but we are not engaged in a knockabout and are merely trying to make a simple point about a parental base for starting a ballot procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
As I said, if the context of the debate of yesterday and this morning were still live, it would bring into sharp focus the question of whether the Education Reform Act in England was preferable to what we suggested. I return to the point because I think that the Minister will give a decisive no to the amendment, but he should consider raising the threshold of 10 per cent, of parents to the figure of 20 per cent, that we projected. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) suggested a figure of 25 per cent. We wanted to put on record that we believe that this is a moderate, sensible measure. I thought that the figure of 10 per cent, was originally written in the Bill so that it could be amended. That was the view of many organisations in Scotland. We thought that it was so written to provide an opportunity for a debate to ensue and a change to be made. That is clearly not the case. Like many others we have misjudged the Government's mood on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to our worry that 10 per cent, is not a representative number. Conservative Members also make valid points. The dock scheme was even brought in by the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), who appears to be finding it difficult to keep his eyes open at present. I think he wishes his ears were closed, too. The figure could be 10 per cent., 20 per cent., 30 per cent, or 40 per cent., but the simple point is that 10 per cent, was felt by the majority of educational interests to be on the low side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, at 2 am all the reasonable points have been made. The Minister has conceded that, but he is not even giving us a commitment to take the amendment away to look at it again in the light of either further information or possible consultation about what would constitute a fairer cross-section and base of parental opinion as we start the self-governing procedure. There is a feeling of disappointment that the Minister will not accept these points. That disappointment is not felt so much by us because we are reasonably hardened, but it will come as a shock to many people in Scotland who have supported this simple measure to find that, without qualification, the idea has been thrown out by the Minister. Sadly, there is nothing further for the Opposition to add and we would like to have a vote on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
