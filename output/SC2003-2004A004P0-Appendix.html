	<p>
	<b>16 The network management duty</b>

	<ol>

	<li>It is the duty of a local traffic authority to manage their road network with a view to achieving, so far as may be reasonably practicable having regard to their other obligations, policies and objectives, the following objectives —</li>

	<ol>

	<li>securing the expeditious movement of traffic on the authority's road network; and</li>

	<li>facilitating the expeditious movement of traffic on road networks for which another authority is the traffic authority.</li></ol>

	<li>The action which the authority may take in performing that duty includes, in particular, any action which they consider will contribute to securing—

	<ol>

	<li>the more efficient use of their road network; or</li>

	<li>the avoidance, elimination or reduction of road congestion or other disruption to the movement of traffic on their road network or a road network for which another authority is the traffic authority;</li></ol>
and may involve the exercise of any power to regulate or co-ordinate the uses made of any road (or part of a road) in the road network (whether or not the power was conferred on them in their capacity as a traffic authority).</li>

	<li>In this Part "network management duty", in relation to a local traffic authority, means their duty under this section.</li></ol></p>

	<p>
	<b>17 Arrangements for network management</b>

	<ol>

	<li>A local traffic authority shall make such arrangements as they consider appropriate for planning and carrying out the action to be taken in performing the network management duty.</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004A004P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<li>The arrangements must include provision for the appointment of a person (to be known as the "traffic manager") to perform such tasks as the authority consider will assist them to perform their network management duty.</li>

	<li>The traffic manager may (but need not) be an employee of the authority.</li>

	<li>The arrangements must include provision for establishing processes for ensuring (so far as may be reasonably practicable) that the authority —</li>

	<ol>

	<li>identify things (including future occurrences) which are causing, or which have the potential to cause, road congestion or other disruption to the movement of traffic on their road network; and</li>

	<li>consider any possible action that could be taken in response to (or in anticipation of) anything so identified;</li>

	<li>but nothing in this subsection is to be taken to require the identification or consideration of anything appearing to have only an insignificant effect (or potential effect) on the movement of traffic on their road network.</li></ol>

	<li>The arrangements must include provision for ensuring that the authority—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>determine specific policies or objectives in relation to different roads or classes of road in their road network;</li>

	<li>monitor the effectiveness of —</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the authority's organisation and decision-making processes; and</li>

	<li>the implementation of their decisions; and</li></ol>

	<li>assess their performance in managing their road network.</li></ol>

	<li>The authority must keep under review the effectiveness of the arrangements they have in place under this section.</li></ol></p>

	<p>
	<b>18 Guidance to local traffic authorities</b>
	<ol>

	<ol>

	<li>The appropriate national authority may publish guidance to local traffic authorities about the techniques of network management or any other matter relating to the performance of the duties imposed by sections 16 and 17.</li>

	<li>In performing those duties a local traffic authority shall have regard to any such guidance.</li></ol></ol></p>

	<p>
	<b>19 Power to require information relating to network management</b>

	<ol>

	<li>The appropriate national authority may direct a local traffic authority to provide it, within a specified period, with specified information connected with any aspect of the performance of their duties under sections 16 and 17.</li>

	<li>The information that may be specified in such a direction—</li>

	<ol>

	<ol>
	<li>1 (1) An authorised officer of a street authority may, if he has reason to believe that a person is committing or has committed a fixed penalty offence, give him a fixed penalty notice in relation to that offence.</li>

	<ol>

	<li>In this Schedule "fixed penalty notice" means a notice offering a person the opportunity of discharging any liability to conviction for a fixed penalty offence by payment of a penalty.</li></ol>

	<li>A fixed penalty notice for an offence may not be given after such time relating to the offence as the Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe.</li></ol></p>

	<div class='schedule_sub_title'>Contents of fixed penalty notice</div> <!-- schedule_sub_title -->

	<p>3 (1) A fixed penalty notice must identify the offence to which it relates and give reasonable particulars of the circumstances alleged to constitute that offence.

	<ol>

	<li>A fixed penalty notice must also state</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the amount of the penalty and the period within which it may be paid;</li>

	<li>the person to whom and the address at which payment may be made;</li>

	<ol>

	<li>The period for payment of the penalty is the period of 29 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given.</li>

	<li>The street authority may extend the period for paying the penalty in any particular case if they consider it appropriate to do so.</li></ol></p>

	<div class='schedule_sub_title'>The discounted amount</div> <!-- schedule_sub_title -->

	<p>5 (1) A discounted amount is payable instead of the amount prescribed under paragraph 4(1) if payment is made before the end of the period of 15 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given.

	<ol>

	<li>The discounted amount for a fixed penalty offence is such amount, not exceeding 25 per cent. of the maximum fine for the offence, as may be prescribed.</li>

	<li>If the last day of the period specified in sub-paragraph (1) does not fall on a working day, the period for payment of the discounted amount is extended until the end of the next working day.</li></ol></p>

	<li>No proceedings for the offence may be commenced before the end of the period for payment of the penalty.</li>

	<li>No such proceedings may be commenced or continued if payment of the penalty is made before the end of that period or is accepted by the street authority after that time.</li>

	<li>Payment of the discounted amount only counts for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) if it is made before the end of the period for payment of the discounted amount.</li>

	<li>In proceedings for the offence a certificate which —

	<ol>

	<li>purports to be signed by or on behalf of the person having responsibility for the financial affairs of the street authority; and</li>

	<li>states that payment of an amount specified in the certificate was or was not received by a date so specified,</li></ol>

	<li>Where a notice under sub-paragraph (1) is given—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the authority shall repay any amount which has been paid by way of penalty in pursuance of the fixed penalty notice; and</li>
