	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>European Community Document No. 9997/91 on Milk</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start by explaining the background to the Commission report and proposal contained in document no. 9997/91. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, whole milk has traditionally been marketed with its fat content unaltered—the fat content is as it comes from the cow.
	<br><blockquote><p>THE CHAIRMAN'S attention having been called to the fact that three Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and three Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining that in continental Europe, however, whole milk has been sold in standardised form with its fat content adjusted to a fixed level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Commission's report shows, in the UK and Ireland, liquid milk consumption is a much more significant outlet for milk than in most other member states. The importance of maintaining that was a major factor when the present rules on marketing of whole milk were drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was therefore decided that member states would permit the production and sale within their territories either of standardised or non-standardised milk, but not of both. Member states that chose to permit the production only of non-standardised milk were permitted to prohibit the import of standardised milk with a fat content lower than the average of their domestic production. The purpose of that provision was to protect the domestic industry from imports of standardised milk with which it could not compete. The guideline figure for imports is set annually by the Council on a proposal from the Commission. The UK and Ireland are the only two member states to have chosen that option. Since milk in other member states is generally standardised to 3.5 per cent or 3.6 per cent fat, below the UK average and thus guideline figure of 4 per cent, the existing rules largely protect the UK industry from any imports of whole milk from the ten other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In setting the guideline figure for 1991–92, the Council charged the Commission with presenting to it a report on the application of that system and proposals for change by 1 June 1991. Those proposals emerged in November 1991. In its report, the Commission concludes that the maintenance of measures that effectively partition the Community market in whole milk is no longer justified. It does not wish, however, to impose a single type of whole milk on the entire Community. That would have a negative impact on consumption. The Commission
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
considers, quite rightly, that the consumer should be free to choose between the two products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposal would therefore allow both types of milk to be produced and marketed side by side throughout the EC. In addition, it proposes an increase in the minimum permitted fat content for whole milk sold as from the cow from 3.0 per cent to 3.5 per cent to bring it in line with the minimum for standardised milk. New names for the two types of milk and retention of a separate category of milk with a high fat level, but with the minimum fat content increased from 3.8 per cent to 4 per cent, are also proposed. Finally, the proposal makes clear that standardised milk falls within the monopoly buying rights of the milk marketing boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important proposal for the UK dairy industry. The Commission is adamant that the present restrictions on standardised milk entering the UK cannot continue. Since maintenance of those restrictions requires a proposal from the Commission to the Council each year, its view is certain to prevail. It is therefore essential that we negotiate changes to the existing rules to enable the UK industry to compete on equal terms with imports of standardised milk. The proposals are therefore welcome, as they are intended to permit the production of both standardised and non-standardised milk throughout the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed about the timing of the introduction of the new arrangements. The Commission originally proposed that they come into effect on 1 April 1992. However, that would have given the industry insufficient time to invest in new plant, design new packaging to conform with new rules on the naming of milk and use up old stocks of packaging. Following requests from the UK and other member states for a delay in the implementation date, the Commission has now said that it will propose delaying the introduction of the new rules until 1 January 1993. At the same time, it will propose extending the existing import restrictions until the same date. That is essential from the Government's point of view. A situation whereby the UK industry was prevented from producing standardised whole milk, but had to compete with imports, would be unacceptable. Ideally, we would have preferred a year's delay, but the proposal has the support of all other member states and is intended to give the industry sufficient time to adapt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed increase in minimum fat content of non-standardised milk is aimed at reducing the risk of fraud. Without the increase, there must be some risk that milk, which has had its fat content reduced to below 3.5 per cent could be passed off as milk with a low natural fat content. At a time when we are encouraging a reduction in total fat intake, it would be wrong for us to increase the average fat content of whole milk. But, at present, the average fat content of UK-produced whole milk straight from the cow is 4 per cent and only about 2 per cent of our milk falls below 3.5 per cent. So the overall impact of the measure is likely to be a reduction in fat consumption. The availability of standardised milk at 3.5 per cent will also give consumers who do not wish to purchase semi-skimmed milk another less
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
creamy alternative to non-standardised whole milk. The traditional product would, of course, continue to be available to those who wish to drink it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider it important that, whatever new names are introduced to describe the two types of milk, they should enable the consumer easily to distinguish between them. That is probably the greatest sticking point at present. The Commission's proposal is that all milk would be described by the term "whole milk". For non-standardised milk, that term would be followed by the words "natural fat content", and for standardised milk, the term "whole milk" would be followed by the description "adjusted fat content".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal was an honest attempt to meet the problem that both standardised and non-standardised milk are currently described as "whole milk" or "milk" in different parts of the Common Market. It has, however, met with opposition from member states that currently produce standardised milk. They consider that the proposed term for that milk is derogatory and would deter consumers from drinking it. Several member states argue that, under the new rules, standardised milk should be called "whole milk". However, that proposal is unacceptable to us as it would cause considerable confusion among UK consumers. At present, that remains unresolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the proposal to increase the minimum fat content of the higher fat milk category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Common Market intending to standardise the cow, or will the whole cow still be used in the production of milk?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hate to disappoint the hon. Lady, but questions cannot be taken at this stage of our proceedings. They can be asked later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted to speculate on that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Channel Islands will be able to continue producing their separate high-fat creamier milk. The practical impact of raising the minimum fat content is negligible as Channel Islands milk in the UK is already required to have at least 4 per cent fat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal relating to the monopoly buying powers of the milk marketing boards is a welcome element. Until such time as the boards are replaced by non-statutory marketing arrangements, the Government are committed to sustaining the proper and reliable operation of the milk marketing schemes within the existing legal framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standardised milk could potentially become the norm for whole milk sold in the United Kingdom, in which case it could take up to 60 per cent of the market for liquid milk or 30 per cent of the total milk market. If there was doubt over whether standardised milk was within the boards' powers, the schemes could be seriously undermined. We therefore strongly support this aspect of the Commission's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Change to the existing rules on imports of whole milk into the United Kingdom is inevitable. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Commission's proposal will enable the United Kingdom industry to compete on equal terms with imports of standardised milk and will give consumers added choice in the types of milk they can purchase. It is in our interest that the Council should adopt it. Problems remain, however, over the proposed names for the two types of milk. We shall continue to press for names that enable United Kingdom consumers to make an informed choice—All sensible suggestions on a postcard please. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unfamiliar with the procedures, but I am sure that if I go wrong, Mr. Lofthouse, you</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not usually tolerant in allowing debates to range as widely as possible, but the document is rather narrow, so I shall be following this debate very keenly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the procedure is to ask the Minister questions at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to the fat content of milk but not to its total solids. The Minister will be aware that it is not only fat content that is important and that there are minimum standards in this country. Perhaps he can tell the Committee what the standards will be for the total solids part of milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this system is popular, it will, by its very nature, increase the amount of butter fat that is available for cream and butter. Does not that go against what we are trying to achieve? There is a surplus of butter in Europe and the rest of the world and if we accept the scheme will not that make the problem worse?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to milk that will be classed as unprocessed. Any system for standardisation of milk must mean, in effect, that it will be processed. Standardising milk means that cream will be added if its fat content is too low, or skimmed milk if its fat content is too high. That skimmed milk will have been processed by heat treatment and it would be dangerous not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not it an anachronism to describe milk as unprocessed when it will have been processed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document is concerned solely with the fat content of milk because so many payments in the EC relate to that. There is nothing in it which deals with solids and I am not aware of any rules that relate to the solid content of milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to butter fat, there could be an increase in the amount of cream available for other products. In a way, that is good news. It is not good news if it is stuck into intervention as surplus butter, but it is very good news if we can make the speciality cheeses for which this country is noted. That would reduce our imports bill because at certain times of the year we have a shortage of cream or butter fat for processing into higher added value products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the milk marketing boards' arrangements work out in the way that we hope and there is a rise in production of our indigenous cheeses and other products, I would welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) seems to have seen a logical inconsistency in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Commission's terminology, but we are stuck with it. The milk marketing boards have taken the view that their semi-skimmed or skimmed milk is unprocessed and therefore comes within the scheme, but the Commission argues that turning milk into semi-skimmed or skimmed milk is processing and falls outside the scheme. The Commission is going to take the milk marketing boards to court about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of standardised milk, where essentially the same kind of task is performed when skimmed milk is added or fat content removed—some form of treatment is carried out—the Commission does not consider that to be processing. It considers that milk to be unprocessed and therefore to fall within the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the court will settle the milk marketing boards' argument on lower-fat and semi-skimmed milk. We welcome the fact that the Commission has laid down a rule that those milks will be regarded as within the milk marketing boards' schemes; otherwise there would be appalling uncertainty in the industry. Until the milk marketing boards are ready to move on to alternative arrangements, on which they are working, we want to avoid further uncertainty or the collapse of the boards and the entire situation degenerating into a shambles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Currie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I understand the Minister to say that payments to dairy farmers depend directly on the fat content, so that the more fat the milk contains, the more money they get, and the less fat it contains, the less money thet get? If that is so, how does it accord with any of the Government's recommendations on healthy eating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The scheme was not invented by the British Government. Payments throughout the EC are based largely on fat content, but other criteria must be satisfied. There are strict rules on purity, water, and so on. Milk may be used to produce products other than yoghurt, such as cream or cheeses. I am enthusiastic about the wonderful new range of English cheeses—British cheeses—now being developed. There are two good cheeses from Scotland and some wonderful ones from Wales, but most are produced in England. To produce cheese, a raw material is needed—cream or butter fat. The milk must be as rich as possible. I see no inconsistency in payments for milk being based largely on the fat content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recommend that we should eat a healthy, balanced diet. We can have a bit of butter or cream, but we must do things in moderation and also eat starchy foods, fibre, non-starch polysaccharides and so on. The Government's views are not inconsistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Minister's intention to maintain the objections or, if forced, will he resile from the Government's present position? How far is he prepared to go to defend his position on naming the different forms of milk?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend to press our case as strongly as we can. None of the terminology is ideal.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I do not like seeing on a bottle a label saying "contains adjusted fat" or "natural fat". Most people do not know that there is fat in a milk bottle. Fat is what chips are fried in. Terminology such as "full cream", "unadjusted whole cream" or "contains a wee bit less cream" might be a little longer, but it would be more sensible than the proposed terminology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend—it would be wrong—to back down from our position that our milk, which is non-standardised and is the natural, whole product straight from the cow, should not be subject to terminology which suggests that it is the odd one out. Our milk is not the odd one out. The other EC countries have always standardised their milk. Historically, the reason is that a 3.5 per cent fat content was not always reached. The 3.5 per cent norm was set to raise the fat content of milk and fat had to be added to it. Cows are now producing creamier milk and the average has risen above 3.5 per cent—ours is about 4 per cent—so the EC removed the fat content. I would not like that milk to be labelled for sale in this country as if that were the norm and ours was the odd one out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will not the upshot of these arrangements be that we will move quickly towards standardised milk? What is the Minister's response to the milk marketing boards' suggestion that we should move towards milk with a 3.7 per cent fat content?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether all EC countries would move towards a standardised 3.5 per cent. It will be entirely a matter of consumer choice, which will be influenced by labelling. If we decide on labelling that scares people off milk straight from Daisy and into using 3.5 per cent milk, there will be such a move. That is why we consider it terribly important to have labelling that uses terminology that is as neutral and as informative as possible so that consumers can make that judgment. If they change to 3.5 per cent milk, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The milk marketing boards' suggestion is interesting. It is contradicted by the Dairy Trade Federation, which argues for 3.3 per cent. They balance each other out; one wants a higher level and one wants a lower level. If the rest of the EC is happy to settle on a fat content of about 3.5 per cent, we have no fundamental objective to that. We are more concerned about labelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister taken account of the representations made by the Dairy Trade Federation? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If lengthy product names are foisted upon us it will be essential for there to be a derogation from these names for milk in glass bottles, since there is insufficient space on the cap for a lengthy name."</p></blockquote>
It stresses the importance of a colour code so that consumers can better identify which type of milk they are buying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it has been taken into account. We already have the right to use colour coding on milk bottles rather than terms or descriptions, which would be very difficult. It would increase the price
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
enormously if extra information were put on milk bottles and if all returned bottles had to be allocated to the right crate so that, for example, semi-skimmed milk was put in the right bottles. Colour coding on the cap is sensible. When we have standardised and non-standardised milk, we want to continue colour coding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still scope for new colour designs and new patterns to distinguish between the varieties. One of my officials suggested that we have not yet had purple spots on the top. A dotty representation might be appropriate!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm my interpretation of some Eurospeak that appears on page 5 of the Commission's report? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Firstly, because this could have a negative impact on consumption of whole milk in Member States where this harmonisation would imply changes vis-à-vis the present situation."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that the expected consumption of whole milk in this country would decrease? In the memo from the Select Committee on European Legislation, the milk marketing boards suggest not only that the consumption of whole milk would go down, but that it might be driven from the market. Does the Minister have a view on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that when people drink ordinary milk—silver top, not one of the special milks—they believe that they are drinking whole milk. Whether or not the milk is pasteurised is not relevant to this argument. Consumers in the rest of the Community think that they are drinking milk from the cow and that their milk is the norm. The British public think that they are drinking milk from the cow and that their milk is the norm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whole, whole milk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right—whole, whole milk minus a quarter—or minus 0.5 per cent. If legislators or bureaucrats suddenly introduced labelling on milk bottles and packets which suggested that the milk that people had drunk all their lives was now different—that it contained added fat, less fat or that producers had mucked about with it—that would have a "negative impact". People would want to know what on earth was going on; they would ask, "Who has changed our milk, and why?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As two sorts of the same product will be sold in European marketplaces, we have to adopt a terminology that distinguishes between them but which does not make people think that there is an awful difference or that what they drank is now unsafe, outlawed or wrong. That is the core of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take "negative" to mean something that would cause confusion rather than decline. My main question was: does the Minister have view of the milk marketing boards' suggestion that there would be such a negative impact on what we understand as whole milk as to drive it from the market? That suggestion is extreme and serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is speculation, I do not think that that will happen, but it depends on the terminology. One could invent terminology that would be so awful and frightening when put on milk bottles or cartons that, if there were much press hype and speculation, one could drive milk from that market and people would drink only whole, natural milk. But that is a slightly far-fetched scenario. There might be a change from our whole, whole milk to standardised milk, but people will not give up all milk simply because the terminology is frightening or awful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ensure, in so far as he can, that the labelling used is not derogatory to fat content? Nowadays, diet is our new religion, and children are filled with skimmed milk, which has a negative impact on their physical and mental growth. Animal fat, cream and so on, is a normal part of the human diet. Will the Minister do all that he can to ensure that the terminology used is neutral?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend has raised a very important issue. We shall examine it carefully, because there is a distinct possibility that, when the Commission's talk of fat or adjusted fat is translated into the various European languages, we could—although we will not do so—end up with labelling such as "contains animal fats", which could have a slightly negative impact. The French might end up with another translation—a lovely euphemism such as "whole, fresh cream." When we settle upon the terminology, we must ensure that it is neutral throughout all member states. Other countries must not adopt labelling that gives a wonderful, salesman-like impression of their product, while we end up with negative labelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the United Kingdom and Ireland are the only two countries that are materially affected, is not it possible to negotiate a much longer-term derogation? Why has the document been proposed when the clear implication of the effect upon milk consumption will be clearer in countries such as ours where there is a high consumption of liquid milk? Is the Commision not prepared to accept that? Does the Ministry agree with the suggested timetable for the changes and is the Minister prepared to tell us what the general effect would be if there were a longer-term derogation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady will remember from my remarks, we did not accept the earlier timetable as it was far too tight. We thought that it was wrong, as did other member states. However, we believe that the timetable of 1 January 1993 is acceptable. We know that the Commission will want to address the difference between standardised and non-standardised milk at some time or another. We have to face that issue, either now, or in two or three years' time. The timescale is not disadvantageous to our industry, so long as there is a reasonable period in which companies can use existing cartons and design new ones. That will require only a six to eight month lead-in period, because so many milk cartons are used that companies do not usually store two or three years' supply.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I do not believe that a longer timescale would make much difference to the publicity. There is sufficient time between now and next January for the Dairy Trade Federation, the milk marketing boards and others to inform consumers about the difference between standardised and non-standardised milk. Asking for two or three more years would not make much difference and we do not consider that a priority. Terminology is our main concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Currie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that one way to solve the problem of terminology in nine—in future, possibly 12 or 15—different languages, would be to insist on stating the fat content—less than 1 per cent for what we regard as skimmed milk, 2 per cent for semi-skimmed, and 3 per cent, 3.5 per cent or 4 per cent for whole milk? In that way consumers and purchasers throughout the Community could make comparisons easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it for me to give the impression, which the public may pick up, that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs Currie) and I are on exactly the same wavelength on the matter—that could be damaging to both our reputations. I apologise to my hon. Friend for that comment. That was the solution that I first considered. Could one not simply state that a carton contained whole milk and that the fat content was 4 per cent or 3.5 per cent? Unfortunately, as my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) said, not every one of our 8 million or 9 million cows conforms to the EC's desire for a uniform percentage of milk fat. By removing some of the fat from standardised milk and adding scientifically controlled proportions of semi-skimmed or skimmed milk, a standard 3.5 per cent fat can be produced. Although you can bet your bottom dollar that a sample from a milk tanker of 10,000 gallons would show a fat content of 4 per cent, milk that is collected from the millions of Daisys throughout the country and sold as milk straight from the cow might contain 3.95 per cent or 4.05 per cent fat. We could not get away with marking 4 per cent on the bottle. We could get away with marking 4 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Instead of 4 per cent, it would be necessary to say, for example, "Average about 4 per cent", but that would never be acceptable to civil servants in the Commission or in most other countries. However, I want to examine that issue to see if we can work around it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an excellent point about the fat content from different types of cow. I suggest that in this context the correct terminology may not be betting your bottom dollar but betting your bottom green pound. Surely we shall be scrupulous in monitoring both the output of our non-standard cows and the fat content in our milk bottles and Tetrapak cartons. Can he assure me that Italy, which has not even monitored the milk quota, will pay the slightest attention to any terminology with regard to the fat content of the milk from Italian cows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a brave Minister who speculated on the number of regulations or rules that
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the Italians obeyed. Of course, the Italian Government try to enforce them—he said, trying quickly to cover his back. Enforcement is not ideal throughout the EC, though in this country it is very good—sometimes to our own disadvantage. That is clear from other aspects of food production. The Government, local authorities and other agencies have rigorously enforced the rules, but that has laid us wide open to unfair competition from abroad. I do not care whether the Italians enforce the regulations in Italy. However, if they try to import their milk to this country we shall enforce them strictly. If any country, in Europe or elsewhere, imports into this country whole milk that is marked at 3.5 per cent and standardised, we will ensure that the fat content is within the exact parameters. If it is non-standardised, it had better be within the correct parameters. Although this debate is not concerned with cleanliness or pasteurisation, we shall want to check other contents to ensure that the milk is healthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a supplementary question. Will the Minister assure the Committee that monitoring procedures will apply to imports into the United Kingdom, otherwise we shall not know whether others have broken the rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The norm in the Community is that monitoring, checking and inspection must take place in the country of dispatch. However, we have a comprehensive monitoring system and, although we cannot inspect every import at the port of entry, our monitoring discloses occasional problems which are then raised with the normal ministerial channels and action is taken accordingly. We want to ensure that we are not disadvantaged by that. At the moment, the only potential disadvantage is that the nomenclature is not quite what it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) asked an important question. I and other members of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs were in Paris last week. We questioned our own embassy staff there on the extent of monitoring that they carry out on whether the French enforce European Community regulations, particularly on milk quotas and on milk products. I was far from satisfied with the answers. Will the Minister assure the Committee that he will try to ensure that monitoring is carried out by the French authorities? I suspect that most of our imports will come from France. It is disturbing that it is up to the country of origin to check. Will the Minister ensure that our officials in France keep a close eye on matters, otherwise we shall find ourselves wide open?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, whole milk imports are most likely to come from France or from Ireland. We will do what we can within the rules of the directive, but I repeat that the general directives on the checking of imports are that the certification must originate in the exporting country. That does not give member states the excuse to stop imports at the port of entry for inspection. Where there is scope to check, we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
shall do so; however, that is largely a trading standards matter. A product that claims to be 3.5 per cent fat when it is not causes an offence against our labelling regulations. I shall give an undertaking that when the rules come into effect, we shall draw them to the attention of the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Trading Standards—LACOTS—so that trading standards officers can carry out inspections. I think that they will find their powers more than adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that, what consultation will there be between the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Trade and Industry about the number of prosecutions by trading standards officers for the illegal labelling of foods? There is little point in the Minister saying that it will be monitored if there is no evidence that the Ministry has been closely involved in monitoring in the past or the Minister has no knowledge of it. Can the Minister give us those figures? If he does not have them with him today, which would be perfectly understandable, will he give the Committee a clear account of the number of cases in which trading standards officers have found illegally labelled food entering this country from other EC countries in the past two years? That would at least give us an idea of whether the Minister's response was genuine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because we do not control and co-ordinate such cases centrally and it would cause grave offence if we tried to do so. We have an extraordinarily good liaison with trading standards officers. Officials in the Ministry have co-operated with them on some major issues, where they sought our professional guidance. For instance, my officials were heavily involved in a case on the marketing of cream or of a non-cream substitute which eventually went to the High Court for a determination of whether the product was legally labelled. Recently, we co-operated on a case about orange juice, because we had expertise at the national level. We have regular discussions to ensure that any information that we have can be given to trading standards officers which leaves them totally free in their county council areas to take the action that they wish to take. I can recall no case when we have hindered them, and that would not be our wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that was not my question. Can the Minister give us information on the number of cases that trading standards officers throughout the United Kingdom have undertaken in the past two years which related directly to the import of food and to any supposed violation of existing rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. We do not collect such information centrally and it is entirely a matter for trading standards officers; they have the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows well that the proposal is important for the future of Torridge and Devon, West dairy farmers who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
cows. However, it is also important to those who produce milk from other animals. I am thinking of sheep milk in particular. I can see nothing in the document that would affect that. Perhaps the Minister will let me know about that matter. Who knows, there may soon be standardised buffaloes in the United Kingdom that can produce milk with a horrendously high fat content, with globules of oil everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arising from the same point is the extraordinary popularity of raw milk, which has an unusually high fat content. By that, I mean milk that has not been heat treated and where the fat is not suspended throughout the milk but rests at the top in its normal way. Non-heat treated milk is delicious and is as different as chalk from cheese from French milk, which has a caramelised taste because the heat treatment causes the sugar to cook. I urge the Minister to confirm that raw farm gate milk, with its high untreated and unsuspended fat content, will still be on the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to those two points. The document does not mention other animals and I am not aware of any proposals to do so, whether they be sheep, goats or buffaloes. However, I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West and confirm whether there is anything in the pipeline on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that we shall maintain our policy of allowing those who wish to consume unpasteurised milk the complete right to do so. We insist only that it shall be adequately labelled so that they are aware that it is unpasteurised milk. If they want to drink it, good luck to them; if not, they have the choice to buy something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask my last question. The Common Market has an important overseas aid mission to deliver whole milk and skimmed milk to the developing countries through the Lomé convention. Will my hon. Friend assure me that the new regulations will not inhibit that excellent provision of overseas aid in any way? Whole milk and skimmed milk from the European Community and especially from the United Kingdom are greatly important to the developing world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carlisle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate, but I probably agree with only one point made by the Minister. I am not worried that milk from abroad will come into this country

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
and be sold if it is below our minimum standards. If there is one product that is tested by trading standards officers more than any other, it is milk. The reason for that is that milk is such an easy product to adulterate. If one adds a pint of water to two pints of milk it still looks white. To the consumer, it still looks like milk. More water has to be added before it looks blue. That is why there has long been a tradition in Britain of testing milk that is on sale in supermarkets. The difference is that it will not be the country of origin that is prosecuted, but the supermarket or whoever sold the milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) has some strange ideas on the subject of raw milk. I disagree strongly with the sale of raw milk—I differ from my Front Bench on that—but the fat content of raw milk is the same as that of pasteurised milk. It is homogenisation that makes the globules of fat stay in the middle of the bottle and not rise to the top. However, that is perhaps an aside and we should not be distracted by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never seen a Minister come to a meeting so badly briefed as the Minister came to the Committee. He gave the impression—as I am sure hon. Members realised—that farmers were paid by the fat content of milk. The Minister is surely aware that in Britain farmers are not paid by fat content, but by the total solids of the milk. It is therefore a combination of non-fat, protein and fat solids that decides the level of payment from the milk boards. I think that the Minister let that fact slip his mind: he was trying, perhaps not to mislead the Committee, but certainly to be a little economical with the truth—because the fat content is an embarrassing issue. The fat content should not be increased because, as everyone now more or less agrees, too much animal fat is not good for people's health. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West on the subject of children. It is very important that we do not give children skimmed milk. There is a warning on tins of sweetened condensed skimmed milk that it is unfit for babies, and that also applies to skimmed milk. One reason why I am not happy with standardisation is that when the fat content is removed from milk, much of the vitamin content is also removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we have a Minister who appears to think that British farmers are paid on the fat content of milk, when that is not the case, and we have a document that lays down no minimum standards whatsoever for non-fat solids or the level of protein. Yet British legislation states that whole milk cannot be sold with less than a total of 8.5 per cent of non-fat solids and 12 per cent total solids. I am concerned that the British consumer will be short changed by the measure and by the fact that the document makes no reference to the protein content of milk. I would have hoped that the Minister would have found out information on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's point about milk that is unfit for babies, a low or minimal fat content is bad for the development of children below the age of 16. The latest medical research may prove—and I know that it is a contentious issue—that too little
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
animal fat is not necessarily good for adults. We need creamed whole milk, and untreated, green top milk, which has an extremely high fat content. We must have non-derogatory labelling, which is of critical importance for everyone's health, despite the scare stories that are put out by people who know little about nutrition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I said at the beginning of my intervention how important the issue is for my constituents, but as I also come from a farming family and have milked cows all my life, I knew those things long before I entered Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having worked in the dairy industry for 20 years and probably have seen more milk each day than the hon. Lady has seen in her life, I take a different view from her. The document is not clear about the composition of milk and the Minister should have taken it away to consider before coming back to the Committee at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion in the document of the provision that milk should be unprocessed seems a little hypocritical. That is included to protect the milk marketing boards' monopoly. Yesterday, I met the boards' chairman, who said that he was being forced to change the boards' operation because the Government were refusing to support, in Europe, the present system. He said that, if there were a Labour Government, he would drop the present proposal and would go back to Europe with the support of the Government to advocate the milk marketing boards' present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government have no intention of supporting the milk marketing board in its present position, which has helped this country for the past 60 years, they are hypocritical to include such a provision in the document. The milk marketing boards' original factory is situated in the Minister's constituency; it was established in 1933. It is wrong for the Minister to say that that provision was included because of the milk marketing board. It is superfluous because within a year—if a Conservative Government are returned—the milk marketing board, as we know it, will fail to exist, because of the Government's inaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document lacks technical knowledge, as does the Minister on such issues. He has given the impression that British farmers are paid on the fat content of their milk. But any farmer in the land would say that, for at least 15 years, he has been paid on total solids. Although I am not able to vote, I hope that the document will be sent back to the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) as I am fairly horrified by the proposals in the document. The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) said that health is our new religion. She may, unfortunately, be right. Such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
a religion is distortive and inaccurate, it tends to change with the wind. I am frequently lectured by some medical colleagues on the iniquities of suggesting to people that they should drink whole milk, when it is important that they drink low-fat milk. However, others say that people aged over 55, especially women, who are likely to suffer from osteoporosis should drink whole-fat milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sometimes difficult for mere consumers to understand what they are required to do in the interests of their health. There is a severe division about the issue in my family. I refuse to drink skimmed milk in my coffee or my tea, whereas my daughter is, unfortunately, rather taken with the prevalent fashion and uses the filthy muck that is called skimmed milk. It is essential that consumers should have clear labelling in respect of milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To include terms such as "unadjusted milk content" or whatever the Commission is suggesting would not tell consumers what they are buying. What is being adjusted? We can have slightly obtuse discussions on fat content. Unfortunately, more women are now buying milk from supermarkets, because of the increasing pressures on doorstep milk deliveries. They must have a clear idea of what labelling means. The Commission's proposals would not provide such clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that, on the one hand, the Commission suggests that it wants a better and more efficient agricultural policy yet, on the other, is tinkering constantly with the means that make it possible for consumers in this country to use milk in the way that they do, which, in general, is much better than in other continential countries. The Commission has started only recently to provide milk in its offices for those who want to drink tea or coffee. One of the bizarre aspects of the agricultural committee of the Community was that we would sit for many hours debating at inordinate length appallingly drafted directives and regulations which said that it was vital for people to drink more liquid milk. However, in the committee, although tea and coffee was generally available, the only product available to go in it was non-dairy fat creamer. I pointed out to the officials that that was a classic example of the Commission saying one thing and doing something else. The European Parliament moved fast and provided liquid milk. Such inconsistencies happen all the time in the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been said about the milk marketing boards worries me. It is one of the ironies of British politics that farmers do better under Labour Governments but consistently give their political support to the Conservative party. The milk marketing boards were created when the British farming community was facing the sort of slump that it faces today. In any area the number of suicides in the farming community is rising and there are increasing political problems. Many people are going bankrupt because of the iniquities and absurdities of the Government's financial control of the economy and the Commission's efforts on the sale of dairy milk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Commission's decisions on milk, the dairy checks and the marketing policies of the milk marketing boards directly affect the incomes of the farmers in my constituency. Political decisions control those incomes. I am worried that this suggestion is an attempt by the Commission and, almost by default, the Government, to interfere yet again with the sale, production and marketing of milk in such a way that consumers will be mildly discouraged from buying it. If the sale of liquid milk in this country drops yet again, and if the type of labelling accepted by the Government has an effect on that, it will be wholly negative, unimaginative and unhelpful development.

I hope that the Minister will resist any suggestion that the labelling proposed by the Commission is acceptable. I hope that the Government will not accept complicated labelling, but will go for increased simplicity so that the words on the label are meaningful in English.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement and warmly congratulate him on the clear way in which he explained the document, based on his solid knowledge of that part of the farming world. The proposal aims to create a level playing field—or should I say a level milking parlour—for dairy farmers and consumers throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the milk produced in the United Kingdom—which is the best in the European Community—should not be disadvantaged. Housewives here and in the other 11 member states should have access to properly labelled, attractively packaged and offered full-cream, part-cream, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk. All those classifications of milk are good for us for different reasons at different times in our growth and in our lives.

significantly disadvantaged by a shortage of milk. However, I did not speak about that area of milk production as it is not precisely within our terms of reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope and believe that this move towards an equal marketing opportunity for the proper labelling of our product will shift the boundaries again towards the equal opportunity to purchase as much of the product as is required by member state processing factories. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister also has his eye on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labelling is at the heart of marketing success, particularly for milk with differing fat content. I am sorry that we have to use the word "fat". It has such derogatory connotations in today's health-conscious world, despite the fact that it has been proven that there is no link between milk fat and cholesterol. Recent research published in the United States and here, shows that there is no demonstrable link between the fat content of milk—including butter and cream—and the level of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Indeed, the latest medical research shows that the level of cholesterol in the blood rises when the doctor approaches his patient with a cholesterol-measuring implement. For years, the myth has been that there is a direct link between the consumption of butter—or full fat milk, to use the old terminology—and the human cholesterol level and that it was bad for us. That link has now been proved inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the words that we use are of vast importance in marketing and consumption. I ask the Minister to try to get the word "fat" dissolved in that context. Cream is the part of milk that we are discussing; that is an attractive word for a highly attractive product, which I believe is good for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to let the Minister get away lightly. It is too important a matter for me to give him an easy ride. I do not agree with everything that the Opposition spokesman said, but the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody) made some sane and sensible points on diet. Once the new labels and new words have been decided and the new contextual backgrounds for milk have been decided, will the Minister think hard about twisting Treasury Ministers' arms to get more money from us all—as consumers of milk—for the marketing of the product? The housewife will need time to get used to the new labelling. I want, above all, to ensure that our milk gets the best possible boost from the new labels. It does not matter whether there are 12 stars on the bottle tops or stripes or spots before the unfortunate cows' eyes. Let us make sure that British milk, which I believe is best, is bought by as many people in the European Community as possible. Some cash up front for new marketing would not go amiss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek a level playing field—or a level milk parlour. The last thing that the Minister wants is for British cows to have nothing better to do than sit happily making daisy chains. They should be chewing the cud in beautiful green meadows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) in his greater knowledge of what is not in the document, and shall confine my remarks to what is in it. There are a number of separate issues—the principle of open competition, levels of fat, labelling, timing, and the designation of processed milk as unprocessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question whether discrimination should be allowed in the production and marketing of standardised and non-standardised milk, the principle seems to be accepted by the milk marketing board and the Dairy Trade Federation. It accords with the single market and we must accept it. A related principle is that of consumer choice. I accept that that should be assured and that standardised milk should be sold throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next issue is the more detailed one of control and protection measures. First, there is the question of fat levels, which is a technical matter. Anyone who has read the document will have found it difficult to grasp the small percentages of fat content permitted in different categories of milk. The most important aspect for the sake of our dairy industry is that the level of fat in continental standardised milk should not be so high as to cause confusion with our non-standardised milk—whole milk. That would suggest a downward pressure on the fat content that should be allowed in continental standardised milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dietary considerations are another source of downward pressure. Several hon. Members have referred to the fact that, for the sake of healthy eating, there are good reasons why there should be a downward pressure on the fat content of milk that is tampered with—standardised milk. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) who seeks protection for the consumer who wants milk with a full, rich cream content. An upward pressure should be allotted for that part of the market. I am not convinced by the argument about the need to protect ourselves against increase in the butter mountain. I accept the Minister's argument, as does the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West, I think, that the surplus fat could be put to other uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with technical matters and those are the principles that I hope the Minister will consider when protecting United Kingdom interests in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On labelling, I agree with the comments of several members of the Committee that it seems illogical to call milk that has been tampered with "whole milk". It is not whole milk, as something has been taken out of it. I wish that something could be done about that, and that the term "whole milk" could be reserved for our milk which is fresh from the cow and not standardised in any way. One is probably beating one's head against a large European brick wall in trying to overcome that problem. I am worried not about the length of the label, but about what it might say, which I believe is the point to which my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody) referred. It is a matter of how explicatory it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without dwelling on the point, I echo remarks made by various hon. Members about trying to give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
consumers a clear indication of what is different about certain types of milk. I believe that the Dairy Trade Federation suggested that there is insufficient room on a bottle cap for lengthy descriptions. When I looked at the examples given in a briefing document that was sent to us, more letters and words seemed to be crammed into labels than was being suggested. It is merely that they are repeated and overrun, so I am not convinced by that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ensure that the description explains the content of milk in a container. I do not accept, that colour and labelling are mutually exclusive. I see no reason why colour coding should not be combined with clearly descriptive labels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Timing is a technical issue. A whole year seems enough, but I would defer to more technical analyses of the problem. The justifications presented to me for the shelf life of various milks and the amount of packaging kept in stock did not convince me that a year was not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To claim that processed milk should be designated as unprocessed strikes me as illogical. However, if that is in the interests of the milk marketing boards and, therefore, those of the British farmers and consumers I would go along with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the valid points made by the hon. Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara). He spoke about downward pressure on EC standardised milk and asked whether there was a danger that it could more closely approximate to our non-standardised milk. The answer is no, because although economic pressures could force the EC, though not legally, it would want to keep the milk at 3.5 per cent. There would be a great financial disincentive to producing standardised milk at 3.5 per cent and having a bit of extra fat in it which could then be used to make cheese and other products. I believe that 3.5 per cent would become the bare minimum and anyone who wanted more than that would be on to our standardised milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Knowsley, South spoke of the illogicality of milk which has had something taken out of it to a standardised level being described as whole milk. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that that is illogical, but ten other EC nations regard their present milk as the whole natural product. We regard our more whole whole milk as a natural product and we are determined to fight for labelling and terminology that would protect not only the dairy interests but consumer interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing wrong with the milk that our consumers drink from the point of view of health, fat or any other factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the position if there were to be a prosecution in this country of a product labelled whole milk when it could be shown that it was not whole milk? There could be a nice legal point here. Were I strenuously to object to being told that I was being given whole milk when I knew that it was not, I believe that I would have cause for an action. Has that possibility been considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady cares to rustle up £100,000, she will find plenty of lawyers who will consider that she has a nice legal point. They will want to help her all the way to the High Court, the House of Lords and the European Court. There could be a nice point of action only if the EC does not lay down a directive determining that the word "whole" shall mean not whole. But if European directives lay down what the terminology shall be, there should be no scope for legal loopholes. If it satisfies a 3.5 per cent fat content or has had something taken out but the terminology in the EC directive states that it is "whole milk", there would be no legal case to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the only real determinant for the wholeness of whole milk would be a cow? The only milk that is whole is that which has not been tampered with by human intervention. Would my hon. Friend care to dub the United Kingdom whole milk as "wholier than thou"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The discussions that I read in the press and on the Press Association tapes about the European standardisation of toilet pans were terribly interesting. However, I do not care to venture along the line that my hon. Friend suggests. That could result in too many interesting press cuttings. Perhaps when a cow is appointed to the European Court of Justice, she will be able to speak for herself. I do not want that to be misunderstood—I was referring to a four-legged cow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are terribly serious issues at stake, but trying to determine whether standardised and non-standardised milk is coming straight from a cow sometimes seems like "Alice in Wonderland".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Knowsley, South made good points about clear labelling and I agree with him. The length of the wording is not as important as what it says, the impression that it imparts to the consumer and its clarity. The latter point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) and the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody). Wording that is too long does not get read and only the first word or a buzz word is picked up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew) mentioned a couple of points but I am sorry that he tried to make a couple of political gibes when the Committee was largely in agreement on most of the issues. The hon. Gentleman cannot see an open door without trying to kick it off its hinges and charge in. I invite the hon. Gentleman to read 
	<i>Hansard.</i> I said that the fat content of milk was not the only thing for which farmers were paid. Of course, they are paid for other things in milk and there are penalties if they add water or unacceptable material to it. So it is not the only factor but one of a number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about solids. The proposal has nothing to do with solids. United Kingdom regulations on solids are not affected and will continue as normal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will not disagree that he gave the impression to his hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs Currie) that farmers were paid on fat content. That is not the case in this country and I am surprised that the Minister did not know that they are paid on the basis of total solids. So, if fat is slightly down and solids are up, it does not matter. For a Minister with responsibility for agriculture not to know that is most bizarre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go further in this silly debate. 
	<i>Hansard</i> can be checked and I am prepared to stand by what I said and to be corrected by the Committee if it feels that that is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no need to try to make political points, even though they were a load of tosh, about the milk marketing board. The European Commission is taking the milk marketing board to court because it disagrees with its position on semi-skimmed milk. The British Government are backing the milk marketing board entirely and are giving total support. The board and the farmers know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The milk marketing board knows that there is increasing legal and commercial pressures for its reform. It has produced proposals for change. We are looking to all the boards—not just that for England and Wales but those for Scotland and for Northern Ireland—to present their own detailed proposals for reform by Easter 1992. There will then need to be discussion with the Commission, with the competition authorities and with the dairy trade. The board for England and Wales has recently announced, in general terms, the sort of voluntary structure that it wishes to be introduced. That is a welcome step in the preparation of its detailed proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to lay to rest the nonsense about the Government not supporting the milk marketing board. I have made it clear that we entirely back the retention of the board's monopoly powers within the scheme until the board itself develops its own alternative arrangements and wishes to implement them. Anything else would be highly destabilising. Two weeks ago, the president of the National Farmers Union urged the board to introduce its own proposals for change. Will he also be condemned for not supporting the milk marketing board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martlew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that I had a meeting with the chairman of the milk marketing board yesterday and he told me that the plans were being changed because of problems with Europe and that the Government refused to support the board on that matter. When the Labour party wins the general election and we decide to retain the milk marketing board, the board will scrap the present proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate could end up as a silly political battle and I will not engage in that. I am content with what I said. The Government support the milk marketing board moving towards producing its own proposals for sensible reform in the industry. We back it entirely in its argument with the Commission and shall back it when it goes to the Court of Justice. The president of the National Farmers Union himself urges the milk marketing board to change, because he can see the threat posed
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
by European competition, which could make the board collapse like a house of cards within a year or two. The British Government have to take a quasi-judicial position because we have to consider the interests of the Dairy Trade Federation and the milk marketing board. We cannot—and will not—make silly political statements that we back the dairy trade against the board or the board against the dairy trade. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is in that quasi-judicial position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody) made some wise points. She was right to say that whatever labelling we have, the words should be clear in English. English should always be clear and English translations should be clear and sensible. We want to ensure that the terminology, when translated into English, is not derogatory to British milk. My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West raised that point. She spoke about a level playing field—which we desperately want—and about a level milking parlour. I remind her that some milking parlours are rotary—they go round in circles, which we would wish to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are still flat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but they go round. The hon. Lady's points about labelling are in accord with points made by nearly every member of the Committee who spoke on the subject. The Government consider them very important. I give her an undertaking that I shall consider what she said about cream. It would be a nice word to have on the label, if we could persuade the others to have it, because the fat content of milk is contained in the cream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a very serious point. In the single market, we will be unable to identify products by country on the label—we will not be able to say "UK milk" or "UK cream". The definition will have to be regional. If we are allowed to say "cream", would the Minister also consider labels that say "Scottish cream" or "Cumbrian cream", or, dare I say, "Devon cream"—the best of all creams. Regional labelling will be very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, with which I shall deal later. I want to deal first with the point about money for marketing. It is up to the producers of a product to spend money on marketing. I see many advertisements for milk, but they are the producers' responsibility, not mine. I am not a marketing man, nor is any politician, in the sense of marketing someone else's product. It is certainly not the Treasury's job.

	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lofthouse. I hope that the Minister will forgive me. What is the quorum for the Committee? Although I am anxious that the consumer should be protected, it is not the job of Her Majesty's Opposition to

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Department produces leaflets on informative labelling and on guidance for consumers. We would not consider producing a separate leaflet to deal with my hon. Friend's point, but that might be a suitable subject for inclusion in a revised edition of our booklet about understanding labels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regional labelling, the norm is that the Government cannot make regulations insisting on country of origin labelling, but I know of no product produced in the EC for which it is not possible voluntarily to show the country or county of origin or in some way to draw attention to the region of origin. That cannot be shown directly on an egg, but it can be printed on the boxes. For all other products that is permissible. I will check to ensure that I have not got that wrong—there may be the odd product to which it does not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a tea factory in my constituency that has achieved a British standard, so it is possible to know not only where the tea was picked, but what has happened to it all the way through the manufacturing process. Would not it be possible for Britain to request the same cover for milk imported into Britain, as well as for our own, so that we could produce a similar standard and consumers would know that they had protection at each stage? In some ways we do have such protection, but milk is not labelled at every stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes a good point, which our producers and the milk marketing board may want to pursue. I think that she is referring to BS 5750, which is similar to the international standard, ISO 9000. That is a good system and we are keen to encourage companies to pursue it. More and more of them are adopting it, but it is voluntary.
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
No doubt the hon. Lady's tea company wants to pursue it to guarantee that its product is of an excellent standard. That is also a good management system for quality control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot compel companies to use BS 5750, although the customers might insist on it and threaten to buy the products of another company. One day the big retailers will probably start insisting that their suppliers conform to BS 5750.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the milk marketing boards and the Dairy Trade Federation, it might be worth exploring whether having BS 5750 accreditation for their milk would be a marketing advantage for the British produced product. Perhaps they would not want to go down that route. I have presented BS 5750 certificates to some cheese plants and creameries which are gearing up for the standard in some of their products, although not yet in whole milk. They should explore that route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot insist on a label saying, "This product is of UK origin" as that would seem to be designed to keep out foreign products. I will write to each member of the Committee if I am wrong, but I believe that there is nothing to prevent companies, producers or regions from voluntarily showing the area of origin on their products, provided that they do not try to prevent the next guy from selling his products if they do not carry a similar label. Milk producers in Devon, Cornwall or other parts of the country may wish to state the origin of their product. Regional and brand loyalty is the best selling point of all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
