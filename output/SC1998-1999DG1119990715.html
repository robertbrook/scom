	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (Procedural Rules) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (Code of Conduct) Order 1999 and the draft Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (Guidelines) Order 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome hon. Members to the Committee at this uncivilised hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be an uncivilised hour for some, but as you know, Mr. Winterton, it is not so for Ministers and for Chairmen of Committees. This is late in the day for those of us who have put much time and effort into the matters at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms of the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, the Parades Commission is required to issue a code of conduct, procedural rules and guidelines. It is also required to keep those documents under review, and has discretion to revise them from time to time, subject to the consideration of the House and of another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders are a consequence of such a review. The original documents issued by the commission were laid before Parliament on 23 February 1998, just days after it had assumed its full statutory powers. The commission now has the 1998 marching season behind it, and many major parades in the 1999 season have also passed. With the benefit of that experience, the commission believes that the original documents can be improved on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As all Committee members will know, parades in Northern Ireland are the subject of strongly held views on both sides of the community. Consequently, the commission works in a highly charged environment, and it has inevitably been much criticised, especially, but not exclusively, by the Orange Order. Those criticisms are well known, and it is not for me to outline them for the Committee's benefit—I shall leave that to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us about any parades adjudicated on by the commission which are not Orange Order parades?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will provide details to the Committee, but it is probably better for me to do so in my winding-up speech. It is important that we can be precise and accurate about all the parades considered. The Parades Commission considers the whole range of applications submitted to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that the commission receives many criticisms, which are not exclusively from the Orange Order, although it is recognised that that body makes heavy criticism. Those criticisms are ill judged and ill founded. The Government are clear that members of the commission have an extremely difficult task, which they strive to carry out even-handedly and in the best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since it was first established, the commission has received notification of more than 6,000 parades. It has found it necessary to issue route restrictions in respect of fewer than 200 applications. The commission was notified of 616 parades that took place between 10 and 15 July this year. It issued 46 decisions in respect of those parades, 26 of which consisted of route restrictions. Those statistics are significant and are usually overlooked by those commenting on the commission's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission's first year with full powers was undoubtedly difficult. All of us will remember last year's scenes at Drumcree. Particularly tragic was the murder of the three young Quinn boys, which was associated with events at Portadown and Drumcree. Our thoughts are with the Quinn family, who must feel that loss particularly strongly at this time of year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the year that followed, because of the stand-off at Drumcree, Royal Ulster Constabulary officer Frankie O'Reilly was murdered, more than 200 other RUC officers were injured and 73 officers were forced to leave their homes. That does not include the four families who had to flee their homes because they had sons or daughters who were members of the RUC. The majority of the community in Portadown is prevented from leading a normal day-to-day life, and the residents of the Garvaghy Road have had to endure a wholly unacceptable living environment because of the level of sectarian threat against them. The cost in human terms is appalling, and a damning indictment of the actions of a small minority of extremists who do not represent the wishes of the decent majority of people in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many parades passed off peacefully last year and a different climate has prevailed this summer, resulting in a markedly different outcome. That has owed much to the dignified and disciplined behaviour of the Orange Order. Although the order still declines to engage with the commission or, in the main, to talk face to face with residents, it has, under protest, abided by the commission's determinations and has urged its membership and supporters to uphold the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is reflected in the security statistics. The comparisons between this year and last year make striking reading. I do not intend to go through all the statistics, but I should like to highlight some of them.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
In 1998, the figure for public order incidents stood at 614; for this year, it is 43. There were 625 petrol bombing incidents in 1998; this year the figure is 17. The figure for criminal damage to homes was 137 last year; this year it is 29. The figure for plastic baton rounds fired by the security forces, which usually reflects the level of public disorder on the streets, was 823 last year; this year it is one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures give a flavour of the substantial change that has taken place. That outcome is due in large part to the painstaking and responsible way in which the commission, under its chairman Alistair Graham, has carried out its responsibilities. He and his colleagues have our gratitude. As Mr. Graham recently said, it is important that the peaceful atmosphere that has prevailed so far this year should be built on for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn specifically to the orders. In the light of experience to date, the commission believes that procedural changes are necessary. The orders give effect to its considered opinion on changes that are designed to enhance its operational effectiveness. They deal with the commission's code of conduct, procedural rules and guidelines, and give effect to the revised versions of the commission's statutory documents. They were laid before the House on 30 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the orders are so closely related, it is right that we should consider all three together. I stress to the Committee that many of the amendments, which are set out in the revised documents, are simply good housekeeping on the part of the commission. As the commission is under an obligation to review and revise the documents, it has taken the opportunity to update them where necessary and make minor grammatical changes, which would not by themselves merit revision of the documents. I do not propose to take up the Committee's time with those housekeeping changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee have received a copy of the revised documents, together with a paper highlighting the proposed changes. Some of those changes are important, and are designed to streamline the system. For example, changes to the procedural rules reflect the commission's experience of the limitations of the formal evidence-gathering procedure. Considerable effort was initially expended on arranging evidence-gathering sessions, with sometimes only two or three people attending to give evidence. The revised procedural rules provide for that procedure to be retained, but only as an option and where appropriate. The commission will continue to welcome all evidence, information and advice, which assists it in reaching its final decisions. The changes of the greatest substance reflect the experience of the past year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4·2 of the guidelines for commission members originally provided that, as a general rule, the commission would regard the commercial centres of towns and cities as neutral zones and be inclined to support the case for processions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience has shown that provision to be factually inaccurate. Commercial premises have owners and employees, all of whom come from one tradition or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
other, and town centres are evenly balanced in sufficiently few cases for the provision to be unsafe, even as a general rule. Under the revised procedures, the commission will consider the demographic balance among the residents in the immediate area surrounding any contested parts of a route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, the area is genuinely neutral, the commission's determination will reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 4 of the procedural rules originally provided for the commission to express a preliminary view about parades in a particular location. However, by the end of the 1998 marching season, the commission had issued determinations in respect of all the areas in which contentious parades take place. Its view for each location is, therefore, known. In addition, its annual report effectively provides a de facto preliminary view. A formal preliminary view, as originally envisaged, is now deemed to be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1·2 of the introduction to the guidelines lists factors to which the commission shall have regard in determining whether to impose conditions on a parade. A new paragraph that was inserted after that list reflects an Appeal Court ruling to the effect that the commission is not restricted to having regard exclusively to those factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having produced its amendments in draft form at the end of January, the Parades Commission engaged in an extensive consultation exercise. It was originally intended that Parliament should consider the present statutory instruments in April this year. The commission agreed, however, to defer submission of its documents at the request of several of its consultees so that they might give a fuller response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now appropriate to proceed with the revisions to the documents. One factor is the considerable increase in the number of parades being notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On average, the commission has recorded a 50 per cent. increase this year over last. Between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 1999, it received notification of 3,211 parades. Already since 1 April this year, more than 2,900 parades have been notified to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that trend continues, the commission can expect to receive notification of approximately 2,400 parades between 1 August this year and 31 March next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents before as provide for an even-handed and impartial system, to the benefit of both sides of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many of the amendments are designed to streamline the system, they will benefit both the commission and those who organise and take part in parades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in everyone's interest that they are made at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by reiterating your views on the uncivilised hour at which we have had to meet, Mr. Winterton. The Committee's new starting time has clashed with something else that I had planned. I therefore seek your indulgence and that of the Minister because I will be unable to stay to the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
In the light of this morning's disappointing news and the headlines in all the newspapers, it seems slightly irrelevant for us to be debating the details of guidelines and procedures for public processions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to commend Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office and their officials for all the hard work that they have put in over the past year or so. I urge them to continue their efforts. A deal is tantalisingly close, and movement could be made after a sensible period of review. Ministers have our support in continuing their efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his detailed assessment of the operation of the Parades Commission. I should have thought that the matter was quite simple. This year seems to have gone off remarkably well. That must be down to the way in which the Parades Commission—Mr. Graham and his commissioners— has operated. The success of its efforts can be seen in the statistics that the Minister read out. It is a considerable achievement, which deserves noting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the commission for the working papers that it sent, which made life much easier. It was very helpful to know what changes had been made, rather than having to find out by cross-referencing the three different booklets. As the Minister said, many of them are housekeeping changes, some more important than others. The Minister put the public processions situation and the guidelines into context when he said that there had been more than 6,000 applications but only about 200 route modifications. The idea that this is a massive problem throughout Northern Ireland persists, but it is not true. Only a few critical parades cause difficulties. Mostly, parades are accepted by both sides of the community and go off peacefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to commend, this year, the Orange Order for the responsible, dignified and disciplined way in which it has operated. I suspect that the political situation has something to do with that, although mediation as a result of the Parades Commission and the involvement of the commissioners will have played an important part. I echo the condolences that the Minister offered to the Quinn family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite some initial misgivings about the arrangements for public processions—as the Minister will remember, we clashed on several occasions during the passage of the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998—the provisions have been a successful addition to the legal position in Northern Ireland. Judging from this year, it has been a successful operation and all involved are to be commended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.16 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a Unionist and an Orangeman, I do not accept the Parades Commission. We strenuously opposed the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill during its passage through the House of Commons in 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland Ministers come over to Northern Ireland, but they have never lived there. Nevertheless,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
they think that they know more about Northern Ireland than the people who live there and they lay down diktats on what they consider to be best for Northern Ireland. The Minister who was responsible for putting the legislation through the House strenuously rejected every appeal we made. Now that the Act is in force, the Government have discovered that what we said was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the problems of Drumcree; last year's problem there was of course a result of the Parades Commission's decision Had the parade been allowed to go down the road, as it ought to have been—it has every justification and right to do so—we would not have had the problems of the past year, nor would we have seen the deaths or the action against the Royal Ulster Constabulary. They were a result of the commission's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the idea that Drumcree road is a Roman Catholic road. Drumcree road is a public highway. It is not Protestant, Roman Catholic, Hindu, Jewish or anything else. Everyone in Northern Ireland, irrespective of what they believe, has the right to go down Drumcree road without let or hindrance. The idea that any resident beside any road has the right to stop a parade is completely unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will let the Minister in, yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear a lot about competing rights. There are no competing rights concerning marches. Someone sitting by a road does not have the right to stop a march going down that road; that is not a right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Orange Order would consider any legitimate arguments or ideas on matters such as timing, but no one has the right to stop a legitimate parade from going down one of Her Majesty's highways. There will never be peace or a settlement at Drumcree until that right to march is exercised and the people of Portadown are allowed to return from their church service freely and without molestation from those living along the Garvaghy road.

The Parades Commission is not independent; it is an unelected quango appointed by the Government. We have many such bodies in Northern Ireland. Like all quangos, it is appointed to do what the Government tell it to do. We have seen evidence that the Parades Commission is open to Government persuasion. If the rumours and newspaper reports are right, the chairman of the commission was told by the Prime Minister before 12 July to return from his holiday and meet people and settle the issue surrounding the Ormeau road parade. The Minister might like to tell us whether that suggestion is right. The Orange Order was within its rights to go to the Ormeau park during the Ormeau road parade—it is a public park, it is not in a Roman Catholic area, and the Parades Commission has no right to ban any parade. The commission had to backtrack because the police were happy with the parade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need a Parades Commission. The issue of parades is an operational matter for the police only. We should not have a so-called independent commission adjudicating on such issues. We shall

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
never return to peace in Northern Ireland if that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the procedural rules of the order seem small. Some are, to an extent, helpful—useful changes have been made such as the replacement of "will" with "could". However, others are the usual nonsense. For example, a hymn must be played when passing an Army memorial. What nonsense is that? Nobody objects to bands playing tunes when marching past the cenotaph in November; why must hymns be played when passing a similar memorial in Northern Ireland? Such requirements are petty, unnecessary and stupid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of rights, it is interesting that the Parades Commission tells us:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Guidelines are based on the fundamental premise that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression as outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights are important rights to be enjoyed equally by all."</p></blockquote>
The commission spends the next couple of pages detracting from those rights. It tells us that it will decide on issues that are irrelevant to, and which take away from, those rights. For example, the guidelines refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any disruption to the life of the community which the procession may cause".</p></blockquote>
A parade cannot be stopped under European legislation because it may cause disruption.
The guidelines continue by referring to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any impact which the procession may have on relationships within the community".</p></blockquote>
A peaceful parade cannot be stopped because some people in the community do not like it. The guidelines also cover
	<br><blockquote><p>"any failure to comply with the Code of Conduct (whether in relation to the procession in question or any previous procession)".</p></blockquote>
That is completely illegal under the European convention on human rights. We may rest assured that many such provisions will be tested when the convention comes into operation under the Human Rights Act 1998, when it will be much easier to challenge them than it is at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders represent little change and will make little difference to parading issues in Northern Ireland. So, although I do not agree with many of the provisions, I am happy enough to let the orders be passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As the Minister said, many of the provisions are a matter of good housekeeping. I should put on record my belief that being a member of the Parades Commission must be a terrible job. It is difficult to earn any praise, and easy to be criticised. I certainly empathise with the members of the commission, because I sometimes feel that being a Liberal Democrat involves exactly the same problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Having said that, and especially having heard what the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) said, it is testimony to the fact that that tested body has done a pretty good job that only a small proportion of parades have been called in for assessment and required to do something different from that proposed in the original application. In that sense, the commission has made a constructive impact on parades in Northern Ireland. I do not want to go too far into the Garvaghy road example, but this year's parade passed off peacefully in large part because the Parades Commission was willing to make some difficult decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we pass these slight modifications is less important than recognising that the commission represents an effort to cure symptoms rather than the underlying causes of the frictions in Northern Irish politics. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said, it is a source of profound disappointment that it appears that the main, larger process has stalled once again—although hope springs eternal, and we will see what happens today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of what has already been said, it is incumbent on us to recognise that the changes that we are asked to support are housekeeping measures. I hope that we all recognise that for so long as we need a Parades Commission, we are recognising a strategic friction in Northern Ireland. Neither the Parades Commission nor any legislation can resolve that until the factions in Northern Ireland choose to do so for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) for their genuine and sincere thanks to the Parades Commission. They captured the right language to express that, and built on what I said about the energy, effort and commitment that all members of the commission put into their job. They have a difficult and onerous task, which is not without its risks—although I do not want go into the potential and real threats imposed on them as they go about their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to let the debate pass without commenting on some of the remarks of the hon. Member for West Tyrone. I recognise his prejudice and lack of balance on the matter. He averred that if the Parades Commission had made a different determination last year, there would have been a more peaceful environment, but advanced no evidence for saying so. I tried to intervene on him to ask him to do so, but he did not allow me the opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Constable commented at the time about the difficult decisions that have to be taken. It is not just the Parades Commission which makes the determination in this respect—the Chief Constable has to make judgments about public order matters on the back of that determination. Depending on what the Chief Constable so determines, the Secretary of State can be brought into play as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out that Labour Members believe as, I assume, do Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members, that the Parades Commission is doing an excellent job?

All Members of this United Kingdom Parliament have the right to comment about a constituent part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for West Tyrone was effectively saying that there should be home rule for Northern Ireland, and that those who are not from Northern Ireland should not participate in its affairs— we should have no view and no say. I ask him to think of the many non-Northern Ireland soldiers who serve in the Province. Many of them have given their lives in defence of democracy and against terrorism. We all make a contribution, and we all have a role to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not say one word of condemnation of the murder of the RUC officer, the number of RUC officers who have been driven from their home, the number who have been injured or the murder of the Quinn boys. I gave him the opportunity to do so, which he refused to take, when I tried to intervene on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the only person who has spoken in condemnation of the Parades Commission this morning, I ask the hon. Member for West Tyrone to recognise that the rule of law should apply at all times. The Parades Commission acts under direction from this sovereign Parliament. The hon. Gentleman did not, this morning, recognise that the way in which it acts is in defence of the rule of law. Hon. Gentlemans' have power vested in them and, as I have said before in the Chamber and in Committee when we have been considering this legislation previously, they have the right to make critical, objective and robust comments as proposed legislation passes through the House, but once such legislation becomes the law of the land, they should respect it at all times. That does not mean to say that the law cannot be changed, but to recognise the rule of law would be helpful, particularly at this time, when Northern Ireland stands at a dangerous crossroads. We should all be very careful in trying to move the process forward. Language that tends to provoke, to blame one side and to try to impose conditions on one side without recognising that there must be a balanced approach does not help the process in which we are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone spoke about non-Orange parades. The commission has, in addition to loyal order parades, issued determinations on a number of protest parades by resident group in, for example, the Lower Ormeau and the Whiterock areas of Belfast. However, the majority of parades are notified by loyal orders, and that is reflected in the proportion of determinations issued, which is why my comments were predominantly about that area. Of course the law applies to every organisation and group that seeks to parade and march in Northern Ireland.

I would have hoped that all hon. Gentlemen would have given due recognition to the present difficulties, and to the role of the Parades Commission in trying to make difficult judgments in an extremely complex set of circumstances. I gave some statistics that showed that this year has passed off peacefully, but we are not through the process yet. There are still contentious parades which may take place over the coming months. The Parades Commission will be resolute in coming to its conclusion based on the best evidence, knowledge and experience. I ask all hon. Members to give due respect to it in that process, because it does its best to get the matter right for all the people of Northern Ireland—I think only one Committee member will disagree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal with the murders that have taken place. I condemn all murders, irrespective of where they come from.

Politicians have to deal with people as they are, not as we would like them to be. The reality of human nature in Northern Ireland is such that if we make laws with which people do not agree, there are likely to be the sort of problems and disorder that we saw at Drumcree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that I have never supported, and would never support, any illegal activity against the Royal Ulster Constabulary because I support the RUC—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I fully support the RUC—not like those on the Drumaree road who hate the RUC and wish to transform it. I fully support it and hope that it will remain. I hope that its name will remain, and its badges, and that it remains as the police force in Northern Ireland.

The Minister acknowledged that the vast majority of parades with which the Parades Commission has dealt are Orange parades. It is out to get Orange parades and to stop them going through certain areas. It has actually said that it believes that there is a wonderful political process going on in Northern Ireland in which it wants to play a part, and in order to play that part, it wants to get the Orange Order to march in certain locations. In other words, it makes decisions on some locations because of political issues. The Minister was unable to give an example of a parade on which the commission had placed restrictions which does not belong to the loyal institutions. He talked about protest parades, but my understanding of the law is that that is a matter for the
