	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee long, but it would be wrong to let the clause pass through the Committee without making a few observations about its general effect and where it stands in the pattern of the Government's legislation on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government proposed to abolish unemployment benefit they would undoubtedly make themselves somewhat unpopular, but they have been too clever for that. They do not intend to do any such thing. But, year after year, they have reduced the likelihood of someone being able to obtain unemployment benefit—one of the few benefits still paid as of right and not means tested—by successively tightening the conditions under which such a benefit may be claimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not believe that the state of the employment market justifies such action by the Government. Rather, the reverse is true. As unemployment is higher than the Government anticipated before the general election, it is wrong for them to continue to make it more difficult for people to claim unemployment benefit. There has been a series of technical changes, most of which I would defy even the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) to publicise and make interesting. Perhaps I exaggerate, but it would be hard even for her. The changes do not strike people as being of any great significance until they affect them directly: they may discover that, although their record in employment entitled them to unemployment benefit in the past, it will not entitle them to it in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the features of this successive reduction or removal or rights is the way on each occasion it has affected women in particular and those who work part time. They are also the group of people most likely to be affected by the clause. Many will probably be married women who are unlikely to sign on if they cannot claim unemployment benefit, as they will not normally qualify for income support. Furthermore, the Government have tightened up other provisions in employment legislation of late and introduced restart interviews in a way that seems to have been specifically designed to drive married women off the
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
register. They have to fill in lengthy forms and are questioned in detail about their childcare arrangements and whether they are really available and looking for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young woman came to my advice bureau on Friday with precisely that problem. She had been in work and had left to have a child. She now wishes to go back to work. She has grown up in the belief that in this country there are reasonable rights and justice for someone in work, but she is shortly to be disabused of that. She no longer wishes to work for her previous employer for the simple reason that her wages would no longer be sufficient to pay a childminder. She is therefore looking for a different pattern of work for more pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She first fell foul of the system on the question whether she was available for work. Secondly, when she had dealt with that problem, the question arose of how quickly she could obtain the services of her childminder. Like most people, she is not closely familar with past let alone present procedures, so she said what she thought was fair to her childminder and not what the Department required her to say. She thought it fair to give her childminder a couple of weeks notice because it was unlikely that she would have to start work at shorter notice than that. That resulted in her being told that she was not really available for work, whereupon she consulted her childminder who agreed to take her child at 24 hours notice. She then has to go back to the Department and say that, after all, her childminder would take her child at 24 hours notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recall what reason was given for ruling that she is not looking for work. Undoubtedly, she is looking for work, but that to and fro process would have put off a less determined woman. If she were not, as she is, genuinely, determinedly and actively looking for work, I am convinced that she would have given up long ago. That is precisely what will happen with many women who will not sign on if they are told that they cannot claim unemployment benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have set out deliberately to exclude anyone who does not receive benefit from the unemployment figures and from signing on. The figures now include only people entitled to benefit. That process largely affects women, thousands of whom are excluded from the figures. Women are not allowed to sign on or go on special schemes because they do not receive benefit. A significant number of men who live with or are married to women who are in work are also humiliated in that way. Such men feel it particularly strongly because of the tradition in our society that men bring earnings into the household. Many men are hurt by this system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> My hon. Friend is right. I was about to make that point. Clause 8 will not only save money but remove such people from the unemployment register. I am convinced that that is one of its main purposes. It will mean removing people who are not entitled to benefit, such as my constituent who has been in work since she left school and should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
entitled to benefit. The question remains open whether she will satisfy the Government that she is looking for work in a way that they find acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combination of the stringent availability tests, the restart interviews, the forms which need to be filled in with exactly the right answers—I understand that a leading civil servant in either the Department of the Employment or the DSS recently described that process as leading lambs to the slaughter—together with clause 7, will make it singularly unlikely that a person will receive unemployment benefit even though he is genuinely in the labour market. We are therefore all the more concerned that clause 8 is not on the statute book. If people have paid contributions for what, until today, was thought to be a reasonable period, they should be entitled to benefit. It is wrong for clause 8 to be on the statute book, and I advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and, like the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), I shall not talk about availability for work, because that is not what the clause is about. The clause will strengthen the test for requalifying for unemployment benefit after a year's entitlement is exhausted. It is not, as the hon. Lady suggested, about people who are unable to claim benefit, but about people who have already claimed unemployment benefit for 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. The Minister may not have realised that I was painting a general picture into which clause 8 fits. That is not the same thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about clause 8. The hon. Lady agreed with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), who called the test humiliating. The test is precisely the same as that which was used by the previous Labour Government. The only difference is that it is concentrated within a six-month period, it is perfectly reasonable that the test should be over a finite period, so that it can be used to show a sustained and serious return to the job market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that, in my experience, men in particular who exhaust their entitlement to unemployment benefit because their wife or partner has an income, and who have no entitlement to income support find it humiliating if they are unable to bring any income into the household. The tightening of the test that the Minister talks about will increase the number of men and women in that position. The lack of income and benefit, not the test, is humiliating for those who are genuinely seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that it is humiliating to be on income support after unemployment benefit has been exhausted. I do not think that is the way to regard the issue, especially if the individual is genuinely and actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister does not appear to understand me. I do not usually have this difficulty in communicating verbally. When unemployed people living with someone on an earned income exhaust their entitlement to unemployment benefit, they cannot claim income support because there is money coming into the household. The question of whether they get a further entitlement to unemployment benefit in future if their partner becomes unemployed is crucial to them, otherwise they have no income whatever. Despite seeking work, they find it deeply depressing and humiliating to have no way of bringing any income into their household. The humiliation has nothing to do with income support. Does the Minister now understand my point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Lady's point, it is similar to the point she made this morning when she believed that we were talking at cross purposes. She is saying that many people are not entitled to unemployment benefit, and if the income of the household is such that they are not entitled to income support, they cannot claim that either. I can understand that some people wish that they could claim an additional income, especially if it would be larger than that already coming in to the household. However, I do not accept that that is humiliating, and a line must be drawn somewhere. When I said this morning that the hon. Lady was talking as though no line should be drawn, she disagreed. But that seems to be the direction in which her argument is leading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that in some cases, the woman is not eligible for unemployment benefit, and the income of the household is such that she cannot claim income support either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In referring to an earlier debate, the Minister mentioned drawing the line. Under the Social Security Act 1988, even if the income of the household is below income support levels, if someone in the household is in full-time work, his or her partner will be unable to draw income support. The Government have drawn a line in that context, and they have drawn it below the poverty line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, those people will be unable to draw income support. But families with children can draw family credit, which is a much more generous benefit than family income supplement which existed before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will strengthen the test. It is reasonable that the same time limit that has operated for many years, including under the previous Labour Government, should be put to the test. The test of 16 hours a week in each of 13 weeks means that those who have a part-time job of 16 hours—and who are perhaps on low pay—have just as much chance of requalifying as those with a full-time job on much higher pay. In that sense, the rule is fair and reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
It is fair and reasonable also when we add to it the intention to introduce regulations to ensure that the time that people are on employment training, or sick, or on invalid care allowance or on maternity benefits will not count in the 26 weeks. If other groups commend themselves to be included in those regulations, we shall include them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much do the Government expect to save from the national insurance fund because of this change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say offhand, but the sum is likely to be small, running into hundreds of thousands, rather than into millions of pounds. The change is not being made for the purpose of saving money. Indeed, I hope that there will be no saving whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The note on the financial effects of the Bill suggests that the sum will be £700,000, which is slightly less than the Government were prepared to spend in launching the White Paper on the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision will have a beneficial effect in strengthening the link between entitlement to unemployment benefit and recent contact with the job market. That was the original intention of unemployment benefit. It will also act as an incentive for people to take up a part-time job to requalify or to ease themselves back into work more speedily. That will benefit, not merely the Exchequer, but the individuals involved. The clause is sensible, reasonable and practical, and I commend it heartily to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DISQUALIFICATION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the Committee that a revised selection of amendment has been made for the convenience of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 5, line 47, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) for '26 weeks' there shall be substituted '6 weeks';".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 92, in page 6, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In subsection (1A) of that section the words 'longer or' shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With clause 9, the focus switches from requalification to disqualification. The clause changes the provisions under which an unemployed person may be disqualified from unemployment benefit. The most vicious part of the clause is the provision that, after a permitted period and subject to any regulation to the contrary, the level of remuneration will not be good cause for turning down or failing to take advantage of an employment opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sought to amend the title of the clause from "Disqualification for unemployment benefit" to "Requirement to accept low paid work". I am told that we cannot make such an amendment. Legislation may be wrongly described, but we can do nothing about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. She is absolutely right to set the clause in that context. I shall do the same, and I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton. The clause eliminates the bottom line for claiming benefit, and, in this circus act of a Bill, the safety net of the welfare state is put above the heads of those who wish to claim. They will be so low down that they will be unable to reach it. That is amazing. It stands social security legislation on its head. The safety net will be above people who need to claim because their pay will be so low that they will not be able to qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the helpful notes that I received from the Conservative party. When discussing earlier clauses—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that Ministers have not been sent copies of those notes. Perhaps my hon. Friend will be kind enough to supply them with copies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost suspect that the Minister does not want to see the notes because they contain the real agenda behind the clause. I shall press the Secretary of State to say whether he defends what others say on his behalf. The notes helpfully ask,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does this mean that after the 'permitted period' a person will have to take any vacancy?"</p></blockquote>
The reply in the notes is,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Not necessarily. Current legislation says that a person will not be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit if he has 'good cause' for turning down an opportunity of employment. This will still be the case. Decisions on 'good cause' are made by independent adjudication officers. Criteria will include the person's age, physical capability and domestic circumstances."</p></blockquote>
They will not include level of remuneration. That is crucial. The notes also state that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed changes will ease rigidities in the job market"—</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? It may mean incredibly low rates of pay.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed changes will ease rigidities in the job market and result in fewer unfilled vacancies and more job opportunities overall. Sanctions cannot operate at present against someone who does not follow up a job opportunity unless the wage offered reaches a generally recognised 'rate for the job' or the rate paid by 'good employers'. After a period of unemployment a claimant may not realistically be able to command such a rate."</p></blockquote>
What does that mean in practice? There is a job centre in Bramley in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman consider the position of those in work who see others refusing jobs, yet still being paid benefit? Does he not realise that that causes a great sense of injustice among those in employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not take it lightly for the hon. Gentleman to remind me of injustice. People feel a much greater sense of injustice when they are asked to work for wages on which they know that they cannot keep their families. I shall cite a practical example. The rate per hour for the textile industry, set by the wages council, is £1.99. Last week, I visited Bramley job centre and studied the rates per hour for machinists in that industry. One rate per hour was £1.99, which was bang on the rate for the job, but the rest were £2 an hour. Would Conservative Members accept a job if it paid £2 an hour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what will happen when the wages councils are abolished. The phrase "ease rigidities in the job market" means that if people are offered a job for less than a certain rate, they must accept it or they will not have access to benefit. That is injustice. I am not talking about someone at Bramley jobcentre who feels priced out of a job because another person has a better salary than his.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend could suggest also to the hon. Gentleman that if, through the legislation, the Government can force people to accept much lower rates of pay, the chances are that, sooner or later, some unscrupulous employers will get rid of their existing work force on one pretext or another, so that they can hire new workers at lower rates of pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's reminder is pertinent to the debate. I plead with the Government to undertake serious research into the matter and reflect on the level of wages offered by some employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I took part in a radio phone-in about wages councils. A woman rang to say that her son had been offered £1 an hour for a 37-hour week. She thought that he was lying to her about the wages offered by the supermarket company because he wanted to deny her his contribution to the housekeeping money. She asked the company whether it was true that, in this day and age, it offered people a living wage of £1 an hour. Therefore, we must think hard before the floor below which people can claim benefit is removed. The method of benefit
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
entitlement is inconsistent. The Bill will not enable people to take up jobs. It will simply force them to take low pay. Removing their benefits is a way of ensuring that they must accept low wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech to the Conservative party conference, the Secretary of State for Social Security said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the total consistency of the Conservative vision is sometimes not understood."</p></blockquote>
That was probably the most honest statement in his speech. But the Government are certainly not consistent when legislating on social security. The Secretary of State continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we must encourage independence, self-reliance, and personal responsibilities in all areas of our national life."</p></blockquote>
How on earth can people accept personal responsibility for their families if they do not earn enough to feed and clothe them? Under the Bill, people must stay in low-paid jobs because they will not be entitled to benefit if they leave them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman a long preamble to these rather specific amendments, but I remind the committee that if hon. Members stray too widely when dealing with narrow amendments they could influence my decision whether to allow a clause stand part debate. I have been fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's preamble, but I hope that he will now come to the meat of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your reminder, Mr. Winterton, and will endeavour to obey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument was that, although we are told that the Bill will catch cheats, that is not the purpose of the clause, which simply changes the rules so as to deny benefit to people who are not cheats. I shall now deal with exactly how that is to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the Government intend to ensure that people take active steps to find work? The main lever is to disqualify people by changing the time brackets. Amendments Nos. 86 and 92 are aimed at that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
provision. Altering the time brackets is the easiest way to get the figures down, taking large numbers of people off the unemployment benefit register. But that has nothing to do with catching cheats. Suspicion sometimes works its way round so that people who are treated in that way are accused of being cheats. The tone of the measure has caused resentment. It is covered up by doublethink about catching cheats, but, in practice, people will be forced off the benefit registers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present maximum period of disqualification for voluntary unemployment was fixed at six weeks in 1911, and remained for 75 years without being challenged. For some of that time there was high unemployment. The same arguments about pricing people into work, easing the rigidities in the labour market and so on were heard throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and even into the 1950s. Yet there was no suggestion that the disqualification period be changed. That period was extended to 13 weeks in 1986 and to 26 weeks in April 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Committee stage of the 1986 Bill, the excuse offered by the then Minister for the extension of the period was that, although the number of people leaving jobs voluntarily had fallen steeply between 1979 and 1981 from 416,000 to 245,000, the numbers had risen in 1985 to nearly 300,000. Although that figure was still far below the 1979 level, the Minister said that it was a reason for more than doubling the period of disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the reasons were for the changes in the figures, they have nothing to do with changing the maximum period of disqualification. What is the connection? Where is the Minister's evidence? Why has there been no research or consultation? Why was the proposal not put forward in advance? I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton, if I say that, although the Bill gives the impression of being brand new and tackling a matter that has not been thought about before, we must remind ourselves that if appears in the context of the biggest shake-up of the welfare state since Beveridge—the Fowler review. Yet there was no mention of the unemployed, their levels of benefit or their entitlement to it in the Green Paper or the White Paper that followed it. At the time, we asked questions about what would happen, particularly to the long-term unemployed, because the White and Green Papers were silent on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal to extend the maximum period was tacked on to the 1986 Bill at the last moment, and it was done in that way for one purpose—to save money at the expense of the unemployed. It may have been easy for Ministers to pass over the unemployed as feckless and irresponsible, but they certainly were not benefit cheats, and the Government could not pretend that they were. The Government should not have given that as an excuse for altering the maximum period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increases, first to 13 and then to 26 weeks, show the Government's attitude and reasons for imposing the disqualification period. The change in period should not be imposed as a punishment for behaviour that the Government disapprove of when
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
the claimants have done nothing wrong. It is an attempt to protect the fund from claims by people who are thought to have become, or remained, unemployed as a result of their own actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's subjective judgment is being built into legislation, without evidence. Is voluntary unemployment an insurable risk? In the past, all Governments took the view that voluntary unemployment was not an insurable risk and that someone in that category cannot expect to draw unemployment insurance benefit from the first day of unemployment. But it has also been agreed that a risk that is uninsurable from day one may become insurable if the person remains without a job some days or weeks later. He may decide for reasons of his own that he does not wish to stay in his present job, and instead of waiting until he has found another one, leaves in the reasonable expectation that something will come up or that he has an interview in prospect. If the person is disappointed and does not get another job, he may have to wait several weeks before the state accepts that his predicament could have been reasonably foreseen and that the risk has become insurable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may tell me that no one should leave a job on spec without the prospect of another job. I suggest that people have all sorts of reasons for leaving jobs. They may not be accepted by adjudication officers as just causes for leaving, but to the person concerned—the result of family circumstances of or whatever—they are perfectly reasonable. That applies particularly if the person thought that he might well find another job. It is not always a person's fault if he leaves a job on spec, and he should not be penalised for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, is the maximum period for which a person should be expected to manage on his own resources before unemployment becomes insurable? If between 1911 and 1976 the answer to that question was six weeks, why has it now been extended to six months? Why does someone have to live on the resources of his former employment for six months when in the past it was accepted that he would exhaust whatever resources he might have saved in six weeks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real reason is that every increase in the disqualification period reduces the cost of unemployment benefit to the Secretary of State, the social security budget and the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the 1986 change, the former Minister gave another reason. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That suggests … that any discouraging effect that the legal deductions have been having has diminished or is ineffective."—
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 30 April 1986; c. 1870]</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Minister's predecessor considered that too many people were exercising the right to leave their jobs, so the national insurance scheme is now being used as a means of punishing them. That is the purpose of the clause and we seek to amend it. There should be no means of punishing people and discouraging future offenders because the offence was created by the Government and is not innate to people who leave their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
The same argument was used to defend the increase from 13 to 26 weeks. In a written answer on 10 November 1987 the Secretary of State said that a main purpose of the sanctions was to discourage people from leaving jobs voluntarily without just cause. He said that the numbers had again risen and that the penalty had to be doubled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government believe that people should be fined for leaving their jobs, they should legislate accordingly and leave the courts to decide on proper penalties. It is difficult to imagine that any court would impose a £900 fine for a first offence under such a law, but that is precisely the amount that a single person stands to lose from April 1989 if she or he is disqualified for 26 weeks and cannot claim income support. Even if income support can be claimed, the penalty is still over £360. Such is justice in clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 86 aims to restore unemployment benefit to its original level and reaffirm its original purpose. It does not aim to fine people for exercising their legal rights, but to protect the national insurance fund without causing needless hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adjudicating officers decide on the disqualification period. The maximum 26-week period is used as a blanket figure. Citizens advice bureaux and our own case work have found that the maximum 26-week period is used in the majority of cases. When alerted to that fact the Minister reassured us in a letter to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux on 18 November 1988 that the Commissioner's decision would prevent indiscriminate implementation against claimants of the maximum 26-week period. He argued that adjudication officers
	<br><blockquote><p>"should abandon their practice of automatically seeking to impose the maximum period of disqualification".</p></blockquote>
Sadly, despite that reassurance the full 26-weeks is used in almost all cases. In the meantime, adjudication officers report that they have no clear guidelines to follow when considering whether to impose less than the blanket coverage. Does the Minister consider that the maximum figure should be the figure used? If the Minister means that 26 weeks should be the time allowed, he should omit the word "maximum" because it suggests that people will get away with less and practice that does not happen. Adjudication officers should be given clear guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Timing also affects claimants. They suffer stress and financial hardship because of delays in the many stages of claiming unemployment benefit. The proposals can only exacerbate that. Before they make their decision, adjudication officers are still obliged to wait 28 days for the employer to respond to their investigative letter. The Employment Bill proposes further to reduce the employer's obligation to provide written reasons for dismissal. Therefore, we can only project that further delays will occur. As a result, more problems will be engendered by claimants. I should like the Minister to comment on the delays and assure us that that will not be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
Clause 9 would permit the Secretary of State to increase the maximum period whenever he feels that he should. In other words, he may change it from 26 weeks to 52 weeks. If he felt callous enough he could suggest that anyone who left a job without another one to go to should be penalised for five years or for the rest of his life. Amendment No. 92 would remove the power to extend the period and leave only the power to shorten it. That is a reasonable suggestion. Although it would close one door to the Minister, unless he can justify the extension to 26 weeks and assure us that he has no plans to increase the period again—to either nine months or one year—it is unacceptable to leave the clause open-ended. The clause as drafted gives the Minister a free hand to alter the number of weeks when he is under pressure from the Treasury to reduce the budget for unemployment benefit or when he feels that the rigidity in the job market does not suit other interests. Surely it cannot be the Government's intention to condemn people to keep a job, even in unacceptable circumstances? What studies have suggested that a person can live and keep a family on some of the levels of remuneration currently on offer? If the Minister can say fairly and honestly that he believes that everybody can survive on some of the wages that are offered or live for 26 weeks or longer after leaving a low-paid job, I should be more inclined to agree that the regulations should be changed. However, until we receive those assurances we cannot support the clause as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add to the reasons behind the amendment, which were so ably put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). Changes in the law have had a significant influence on the behaviour of employers towards their employees. It is not simply a question of income, although that is important. The power that could disqualify someone from benefit for six weeks for leaving a job without good cause is now extended to six months. The provision either abolishes all rights to unemployment benefit or reduces entitlement to income support to 40 per cent, of the single person's entitlement. It is impossible to live for six months on 40 per cent, of income support, so the pressure is very strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This country used to believe in people's freedom to work and change jobs as they wished. We hear a lot of Government rhetoric about "freedom". If a person found his work unsatisfactory or if his employer bullied him, pushed him around or imposed additional conditions, he had the right to walk out. If he did, he faced a great penalty—he lost his income from the job and received only the level of benefit to which he was entitled. That entitlement was small, so no one was likely to choose to do that. The Government claim that they believe in the free market, but people are pressured into putting up with intolerable employment conditions by the prospect of living on an inadequate income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
people after six months, or less than a year, in the full knowledge that the dismissed person has no right to take the case to an industrial tribunal? As a result, the employer is able to perpetuate low wages. Because of the way in which social security law is framed, the dismissed person's ability to obtain benefit is damaged and he or she would, in some cases, be forced to accept a reduction in wages and a humiliating worsening of already poor working conditions. That is the effect of the combination of the two pieces of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Employment conditions are deteriorating because of the increasing use of casual and temporary work that is designed to evade higher level national insurance contributions. That issue goes a little wider than the amendment, as you, Mr. Winterton, will tell us, but it is part of the restructure of the labour market with which the Government have been busy in the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extending the period of disqualification has brought about a shift in the balance of power between employers and employees. It is a serious matter. Although I do not have with me all the distressing examples that I have seen in reports, one or two stay in my mind. I referred to one of them earlier, but it is relevant to the amendment. I was at my desk in the Cloisters when a group of workers associated with the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux passed by. One of them was a young man who worked in Northern Ireland and he told me the story of another young man he had tried to assist and, who had worked in Milltown cemetery. The young man's family was worried because he had been going out with a young women from a Protestant family and felt that he would be vulnerable for that reason alone. Nevertheless, he carried on with his job— understandably so because jobs are difficult to find in Northern Ireland. However, following the terrible events that took place in the cemetery after the deaths in Gibraltar, the young man decided that his life was in danger. The focus was on Milltown cemetery and the people who worked there, and the fact that he went out with a girl across the religious divide made him decide that is was not safe to continue working there. He gave up his job, left Northern Ireland and came to London. He was living in a hostel, trying to get work and trying to maintain his relationship with the young woman. He had moved because he had feared for his life—that is no exaggeration—but it was ruled that he had voluntarily given up his job without good cause and he was disqualified from benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other example springs to mind because of my constituency work about six months ago. It was a horrendous case involving the gross sexual harrassment of a young Asian woman in her first job. She started off on a YTS scheme and was then taken on by the firm. It is often difficult for young women to deal with such cases because they do not feel confident enough to complain to anyone. They often put up with such behaviour or try to pretend that it is not happening. However, when she gave up her job, she was subjected to benefit penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government constantly claim that some people are not really seeking work and that they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
taking measures to encourage the small minority of scroungers—a concept that is omnipresent in their minds at Tory party conferences—to apply more effectively for jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is an unspoken, much more cleverly thought-out and deeper strategy at work behind the measures that the Tory Government have taken since 1979 to restructure the labour market. Part of it is to encourage low pay. That has been a successful strategy—the number of those on low incomes has increased—although it has been destructive for those concerned and enormously destructive to the future of our economy. Another strategy concerns the shift in the balance of power between employers and employees. There is now less freedom. Employees, especially those working in lower-paid, higher-turnover jobs are pushed around and maltreated much more. They have less dignity and respect at work, but they have to put up with it because if they walk out to look genuinely for another job they will suffer. They will be entitled only to the basic benefits accorded to everyone to ensure that people do not live in penury as an alternative to accepting employment. If they no longer have rights, too many people will put up with rotten treatment from bullying employers. That should not happen in Britain in 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about changing the period of punishing a person for voluntarily leaving his job from 6 weeks to 26 weeks. My case is that extending the period of disqualification creates such poverty that employees have to put up with conditions of employment that people in a free society should not tolerate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the effect of clause 7 will be that to qualify for benefit people must demonstrate every week that they are actively seeking work, there is no excuse for the 26-week period of disqualification. If a person leaves a job because the job is not suitable, the Bill provides that he must prove every single week that he is actively seeking work, so what excuse can there be for punishing him for six months? In practice, the punishment of disqualification from benefit is always six months for having voluntarily left a job.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
it is not considered reasonable to try to have one's cake and eat it, but it is not reasonable to punish people from two directions. As the Government are tightening provisions—wrongly in our view—so that people have to demonstrate weekly that they are searching for work, the Government should accept our amendment. They should use the actively— seeking—work penalty and cease to punish those who leave their jobs, often with good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Government should be worried about the many findings by officers that cases of employees who have left their jobs without good cause have often been reversed on appeal. That shows that the way in which the rule is administered is not right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) raised a number of points. It is not possible for me to comment on the two very hard cases—I recognise them as being hard—that she put forward. However, I hope that two things happen when Members of Parliament came across such cases: first, that they write to me to draw attention to the way in which the system is working and, secondly, that those who might be affected by such decisions are encouraged to pursue their rights to appeal to the social security appeal tribunal and, if necessary, to the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people feel strongly that hardship has been caused, and injustice has been done, those rights should be pursued, not least because adjudication officers have an unfettered right of discretion in reaching their decisions. They cannot properly be guided by the chief adjudication officer, but they are guided by the development of case law and by the commissioners' decisions. If it is felt that injustices have been done, it is important that the cases be taken through to hearings by commissioners so that case law can establish the guidance that will be followed in future by adjudication officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When we respond to the Government's invitation to tell them how things are working—or, often, how they are not working—we are then told that it is too late, the reform is through, the rules are made, bad luck.

The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) mentioned the hardship rate for income support. It should be clearly on the record that, when someone is subject to the voluntary unemployment deduction—40 per cent, from the normal single person's rate—dependents' allowances are not affected. I understand the hon. Lady's point that there is a difference between deducting 40 per cent, for six weeks—as all Governments have done—and for six months. I shall explain shortly why we believed that it was right to extend the period to six months when we debated the matter some 12 months ago.

The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) incurred some criticism from the Chair. I do not want to be tedious and deploy arguments now that I shall have to use in later amendments about the level of pay. I shall deal with that when we reach the relevant amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of disqualification has been part of the law since 1911. It was carefully considered by Beveridge, who endorsed it firmly, and it is part of the system. There can be no doubt that the purpose of unemployment benefit is to insure people against the involuntary loss of their employment, not against a voluntary loss of it.

Twelve months ago, we increased the period from 13 to 26 weeks because, as was thoroughly debated at the time, it was shown that the percentage of disqualifications, when related to the total number of claims was increasing not decreasing, despite the limit being raised in 1986. Indeed, we were taken to task by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) at the time. He asked why we should double the period a second time, when we had doubled it once and the figures were still rising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make my comments tentatively to the Committee, because we must wait until the experience of the 26-week period has been properly monitored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Ministers barely took breath after increasing the period from 6 weeks to 13 weeks before doing it again without any monitoring period. Incidentally, that met with the complete disapproval of the Social Security Advisory Committee. It was upset and worried that a change had been made without its being informed or consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In due course, the figures for a quarter, or for two quarters, will be taken by the adjudication officer who will make an assessment of the way in which the new rule has been working. We shall then know the number of disqualifications and, interestingly enough, we shall have figures that will enable us to judge whether the assertions of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood that were assented to by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett)—that disqualification is always for the full 26 weeks—is correct. I suggest tentatively that the incidence of voluntary unemployment has decreased since the new rule was introduced. I refer to only a tiny sample that was taken by the chief adjudication officer. In 100 cases, 53 had the maximum imposed, and less than the maximum was imposed on 47. I would not claim for a moment that that is a representative sample. It was taken at random and I should like to see a careful assessment of how the 26-week period has worked.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to be chosen. I refer to the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) about what is and what is not voluntary unemployment. The Minister cannot be held to the statistical sample that he referred to today, but is he aware that the matter of voluntary unemployment must be considered carefully?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tragically, there is a growing number of extremely unscrupulous employers who try to get rid of people. Some of the wage rates to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood referred are not out of order—I know of worse examples. We are worried that such unscrupulous employers will be encouraged to pay low wages and dismiss people who appear to be potential troublemakers, knowing that the lack of benefit will be a major threat to anyone who intends to stand up for the rights that a working person should enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that but I must explain the present state of the law. Adjudication officers have unfettered discretion to take decisions. That has always been true. We can only alter that by case law. Of course it would be possible to make changes in primary legislation. It is important that people who feel that they have been unjustly treated should be able to make full use of the appeals procedure and build up a case law that can be used as guidance by adjudication officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave us reassurance about monitoring the change in the hope of getting off the hook. I am anxious to tie him down about what might happen with the monitoring. If the number of deductions continues to fall and the number of cases

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I am much too long in the tooth to answer such hypothetical questions. An independent agency has been commissioned to explore the impact of the increased penalty for voluntary unemployment and people's decisions about leaving or taking work. The study will cover Leeds, Coventry, London and Bristol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is difficult for the Minister to answer a hypothetical case. There is a straightforward case of a 17-year-old girl in my constituency who had to work something like 10 hours, mainly up to midnight, at a petrol station. An old man working at another petrol station down the road was mugged and she was frightened to death. Her employees installed stronger glass in the window. She had to deal with her own money and petrol and no help was available. Finally she could take the pressure no more and gave up. Is that considered to be giving up one's job voluntarily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I cannot answer that question, let alone say what an adjudicating officer, using his unfettered discretion, would decide in such a case. It would depend entirely on his judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has also been monitoring this. Its evidence from all over the country is that, in the majority of cases, disqualification is for the full 26 weeks. That is probably a much bigger sample than the 100 the Minister cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister refers for justification to the number of people who have been disqualified in that way, it is a completely circular argument. If the rules to decide whether someone has left employment voluntarily are changed and one then looks to see whether the figures are rising or falling, there is no objective standard of measurement. If the Government invite their officers to make that finding and the figures change, it does not prove that people are giving up employment for unreasonable reasons. I therefore welcome the study which the Minister has just mentioned. I hope that it is carried out by a decent and respected independent agency and that the Minister can give us a commitment that its report will be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the Committee that there is this monitoring, and that it is being taken seriously. The field work was done in January and we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
have the findings in due course. The old system was unsatisfactory in deterring people from voluntarily giving up their jobs. In those circumstances, it would be wrong for me to accept the amendment, which in any case goes much further than anyone would reasonably wish to go, and move away from the 26-week period until we have had an opportunity to consider evidence of how it works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all look forward to that report and hope that it will be wide ranging. Many of us know that the conditions in places of work have deteriorated to the extent that employers can now abuse their staff and be much more oppressive than at any time during the past 40 years. This measure might well have an effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gives us assurances, and does so persuasively, but we have a nightmare. The Government are taking enormous powers for the future in the clause. One day we may see before us on the Front Bench one of the Alan B'stard clones who fill the Chamber—not someone as nice and reasonable as the Minister. Our sympathy goes to him. I was trying earlier to think what the expression of his face reminded me of. It was an American writer's description of someone wearing the same look of guilt as a vulture that had stolen the wrong eyeball. That phrase came to my mind and will not go away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is in an extremely difficult position. The Government regard people leaving their jobs without good cause as a crime, so they double the punishment. Nothing much happens, so they double it again. If that is the way to solve crime, why have the Government not taken the same line with the crime that has risen every year in the past 10 years? If they followed the same principle that the Minister now defends, we would have capital punishment for shoplifting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had retained my normally cheerful mien throughout our proceedings. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has been looking away, possibly at some of his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of crime. The purpose of unemployment benefit is, and always has been, to ensure people against the involuntary loss of their employment. The consequence of voluntarily leaving employment has always been some withdrawal of unemployment benefit. The narrow purpose of the amendment deals with the length of time of that penalty. We want an effective period to deter people from voluntarily giving up employment and to encourage them not to take the option of losing their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept everything that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said about the behaviour of employers, but if employers continued to behave in that way they would do so with incredible stupidity and lack of self interest. As prosperity increases and employment opportunities expand—as they will under this Government— employers will take greater care of those who work for them, ensuring that they enjoy good conditions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

and are treated properly. That will be more common as the years go by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thrust of the Bill, and particularly of this clause, is to get rid of what was called in the briefing the rigidities in employment. Those rigidities are seen to be the rights of workers to stand up for decent wages and conditions. A system without rigidities is a slave system—a liquefied system in which the employer has absolute control over the employee. The Bill is heading in that direction. The ruthless employer will be encouraged to become even more ruthless as pay levels are driven down and employees' rights are destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That precisely defines the differences dividing the Committee, and we shall not be able to bridge that gulf. Opposition Members believe that over-regulated systems will protect the interests of working people. We believe that those interests are better protected by the workings of the market and by the ability of people to move into jobs, better themselves, and increase their earnings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dealing with periods of disqualification for unemployment benefit.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regarding amendment No. 92, the hon. Member for Leeds, West asked whether we plan to extend the period beyond 26 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->

I was asked whether I could stand up with my hand on my heart and say that we have no plans to extend the period beyond 26 weeks. I can give that absolute undertaking. In those circumstances it would be right for me to accept amendment No. 92. There will need to be some consequential amendments to make that amendment watertight.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most heartened to hear what the Minister says. Will he make it clear that he is prepared to build into the Bill, and therefore into primary law, the fact that the maximum of 26 weeks will now stick? As a result of the review and the trends showing that the figures are coming down, the option is still open to reduce the period, but it will not be extended beyond 26 weeks. Is that the Minister's position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendments will be that no period longer than 26 weeks can be introduced. The primary legislation will be such that the period cannot be extended by regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what you said, Mr. Winterton, about the clause stand part debate, but the Committee is in difficulty because we debate the Bill word by word and clause by clause. It is sometimes difficult to grasp the full impact of the Bill when we discuss the time periods before we discuss their effect on people. That may be why we have strayed into matters that we should discuss in the stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an ambiguity in the Minister's response, and it arises from the word "disqualification". Although the Minister said that it was not a question of crime, the problem with the disqualification clause is that claimants will be deemed guilty until they prove their innocence, and, in the meantime, they will lose money. Claimants should not be treated in that way. That is why we want a minimum disqualification period, although we understand the-need for one.

	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 5, line 47, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) after the word 'if there shall be inserted the words 'he is toot and is not deemed to be actively seeking employment and';".</p></blockquote>
Under the amendment a person who was actively seeking employment would not be subject to disqualification under section 20 of the 1975 Act. At present, if someone who satisfies the availability test turns down a job afterwards without good cause, he incurs disqualification under section 20. Similarly, a person who gives up a job without good cause is disqualified, even if he is available for other employment. There is already an element of overkill as refusal of a job offered may well be regarded as evidence of non-availability, resulting in benefit being refused for a limited period under section 20 and for an unlimited period under section 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important amendment for me because my constituency has one of the worst unemployment figures in the whole of Britain. This is a Bill of shame, dishonesty and distortion. It has blood on its hands—the blood of Rachel Caine—and there will be many more deaths before it is fully implemented. It will create hardship and despair, and I hate to waste my time day after day knowing that the Government do not care and do not have compassion. Clause 9 tightens up every loophole, hounds people, and makes sure that they are working in a job irrespective of protection or of the minute amount of money offered by employers who are exploiting men and women throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a disastrous Bill. Just to let you know how distorted the figures are that your own Department of Employment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will address the Government and not the Chair in such terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's own Department has produced the figures and checked out all the labour surveys by the Institute of Fiscal Studies on behalf of 250 businesses. There is something very funny about it, and I raise this issue because the Government say that we need the provisions to get the poor back to work. They stated that in 1988, 150,000 vacancies were unfilled. What nonsense. The London labour report intimated that 45 per cent, of vacancies went through the jobcentres. How can there be 150,000 unfilled vacancies if 45 per cent, are filled through jobcentres?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not help unemployed and poor people in any way. Any wage-related expenses cannot be met through the social fund and there is no grant or loan for the unemployed. If a person is offered a job—let us not forget that he has to prove that he is actively seeking employment—which means that he has to move or travel, or buy tools and clothes of the job, there is no avenue for that expense. If the Government were really interested in the unemployed, as they say they are, they could have remedied that deficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important matter shows the Government's hyposcrisy in its true light. In 1988, 88,360 people were disallowed—51 per cent, under the availability condition and 19 per cent, under restricted availability. Those percentages will be far higher once the Act has been amended; the words "actively seeking work", "good cause", "suitability", and so on will apply under sections 17 and 20 of the Social Security Act 1975. It is an absolute disgrace. It has been proven to me that the Government do not give a damn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 640 claimant advisers to look at 650,000 cases, and we hope for 1,200 by 1989. But they are advising people wrongly. They are advising them to look at the possibility of entering into in-work payments, and the calculation is phoney. They are using the wrong figures. They are forgetting about the allowances that people used to have, such as free milk. It is important that we should raise those issues, because when someone is convinced by the calculations—some of the claimant advisers can be very convincing—it is to the detriment of the lower-paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people become employed, they may work on a Sunday or Saturday, and all the extra payments that they have had disappear because after the first £5 as a single person, when everything is disregarded they are losing about 85p in the pound. They are in the poverty trap. They are being told, "Look, this is what we are giving you to get you to work, but that's all you are getting and no more." It is the Government's decision, not the employers'. They want to keep them down and working. We know that 70 per cent, of jobs are not advertised, yet we still believe that the amendments must be made to clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said many times since the Bill was introduced that the great expectations of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
unemployed about wage levels are not unreasonable. The Government's own figures from their survey state clearly that 20 per cent, of the unemployed would accept wages as low as £118 and 40 per cent, would accept less than £150. The majority want to take up employment. They would like to live in luxurious houses and drive fancy cars. They do not want to sleep in cardboard boxes, as 30,000 do. The Government do not run round to check who is sleeping in cardboard boxes and whether they need benefit, but many people do not claim any benefit. No one ever looks at those figures or tells those people what their entitlements are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to realise that the introduction of the "actively seeking employment" test will greatly increase the overlap with section 20, causing considerable confusion to claimants. For example, a claimant who is disqualified under section 20 for turning down an offer of employment and who wins an appeal to the local tribunal may be told that he was not entitled to unemployment benefit anyway because he was not actively seeking employment. The same thing can happen the other way round. On that basis, appeals could drag on for months, leaving the claimant and his family penniless. It has been important for claimants that adjudication officers found in a survey of 1,000 cases that 17 per cent, of the decisions had to be revised. That does not help the claimant, because having to wait four, five, or even nine months may be a problem for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debate on clause 7, the Minister said that there might be a warning shot before benefit was discontinued. Some organisations do not believe him because he also told the Nationl Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in November 1988 that because of the blanket use of adjudication officers under the new law, these officers would be able to use discretion about the period of 26 weeks. To date they have certainly not been using discretion, or if they have, it has been in favour of 26 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from everything that has been said about actively seeking employment and the fact that the test will give more than adequate protection of the fund against unjustified claims, that anyone who manages to pass the test may safely be allowed to draw benefit without the additional threat of disqualification under section 20. The amendment would allow that. But section 20 would still apply where the claimant was refused benefit for not actively seeking work and had also turned down a specific offer of employment. Even if he resumed actively seeking work the following week, he would remain disqualified for up to 26 weeks under section 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 20 already covers the person who is trying to dodge, or to make a fraudulent claim for unemployment benefit, and I see no need for duplication or overlapping. I should be grateful if the amendment were accepted, especially on behalf of my constituents who live with the burden of unemployment and in appalling conditions. It would help the homeless, single parents, and people who are living in despair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes without saying that I reject utterly the accusations of lack of concern or heartlessness that the hon. Gentleman levelled against the Government. We rejoice as much as anyone else at the sustained reduction in unemployment that we have witnessed for some 28 months. We want that to continue and believe that, when there is less unemployment, it is right to provide the maximum encouragement for people to get into employment and take advantage of the new situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will suspend judgment on how the periods of disqualification are being used by adjudication officers until we have the results of the monitoring, about which I spoke earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand it correctly, the amendment would do away with any need for the present provision relating to disqualification for receipt of unemployment benefit. The new test of actively seeking employment that is proposed in clause 7 would be the basic condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit, and any claimant who was not deemed to satisfy that condition would have no title to the benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, to provide for the disqualification—in the circumstances of voluntary unemployment—to bite only where the actively seeking employment test was not satisfied would divest those measures on voluntary unemployment of all meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Opposition should want to do that. Successive Governments have agreed that unemployment benefit is intended for people who are out of work for reasons beyond their own control and that, as with other forms of insurance, someone should not collect it if he or she has brought about or in a significant way contributed to the contingency insured against. Decisions on whether a person should be disqualified for receipt of benefit are given by the independent adjudicating authorities, as I said in response to a previous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in thinking that disqualification is not only from unemployment benefit, but that it also entails a cut in the rate of income support? The clause goes beyond people entitled to unemployment benefit only—we are also talking about people whose only entitlement is to income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was included in the point that I made to the hon. Lady on the previous amendment. I think that we now agree on what the position is. Since 1911, it has been part of the system that where a claimant has lost employment voluntarily or through misconduct he should suffer disqualification from unemployment benefit. That principle has been enshrined throughout that period. It was carefully considered by Beveridge and supported. We can argue about the period for which that disqualification should be in operation, but about the principle I believe there should be no dispute. The amendment would undermine that fundamental principle and I must advise the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being a little brusque. He and the Under-Secretary have spent a good deal

of time telling us that the reason for clause 7 is that the availability test does not work. Now he tells us that the Government want to retain both the availability test and the test of actively seeking work. What concerns us, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) has ably identified, is that someone might be bounced backwards and forwards. Surely the Minister is not contending that someone who has met the test and proved that he is actively seeking work could possibly be ruled to be not available? There is some overlap and duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will recall, Mr. Winterton, that—perhaps slightly wide of the amendment that we were debating—I discussed the case of a constituent of mine who has found that, whenever a query is raised about her benefit and entitlement and she satisfies that query, a different one arises. That can sometimes happen, but it is precisely the kind of procedure which, rightly or not, brings the social security law into disrepute. People tend to feel that they may be being deliberately harassed. It happens not only in employment-related social security law but in other aspects of social security law, when a benefit entitlement is questioned on a certain ground and the person is not necessarily told at the time that, even if he satisfies the benefit entitlement on that ground, he may nonetheless be refused it for some other reason. If, as occasionally happens, he is able to satisfy the first condition of which he was notified, he then receives another letter saying, "We've thought of something else." I realise that the Department may not necessarily have thought of something else, because the underlying provision may always have been there, but that is how the individual feels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the continued existence of section 20 alongside the new test for actively seeking work conveys a degree of overlap and overkill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Provan pointed out, the Under-Secretary said that the Government intended to look carefully at whether there should be a proper system of warning and advice before someone's benefit entitlement is removed. The Minister should at least be prepared to consider the proposition in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled. There seem to be two quite different aspects of the issue under discussion. In the first place, voluntary unemployment disqualification occurs in circumstances in which someone who has a job, voluntarily and without good cause leaves that job and makes himself unemployed. He contributes to the fact that he is unemployed, and the disqualification is a deterrent—it always has been a deterrent—from his taking that step. Once unemployed, the individual should be doing his best, actively seeking to get himself back into employment. They seem to be two distinct aspects of the problem, and they are being addressed in two distinct ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, if someone is ruled to have voluntarily made himself unemployed or has turned down a place under the various conditions laid down by the clause, his right
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
to unemployment benefit has already been taken away? Why, then, do the two tests need to operate one alongside the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is asking me to remove the disqualification provision. I do not believe that if someone has voluntarily left his employment or contributed to his own loss of employment—phrase it how one will—by beginning actively to seek work once he has lost it, he should become entitled to unemployment benefit. That is the distinction between us. The historic principle, that if someone has so contributed to his own loss of employment he should suffer a period of disqualification from benefit, should continue and not be replaced by the principle underlying clause 7, which exists for an entirely different purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should be more honest. He knows as well as I do that the Government are heartless. I use that word because the difference or shortfall between the old single payment scheme and the social fund was as much as £2 million in some areas. That is why I said that the Government do not care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it may also seem heartless of the Minister to make remarks about the general benefits to the economy as though there were an even spread throughout Britain, when many of us know that there are great divisions, even within cities? There is what might be called an urban village in Leeds, where unemployment is high compared with other areas of the cities. There is not an even spread of unemployment, and that can affect access to jobs and what goes on in certain jobcentres. Ministers appear to be callous when they say, "The jobs are there. Go and get them." That does not work in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's alarm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who read the remarks that I made during our earlier consideration of clause 7 knows very well that I recognise that there is no even spread of prosperity across this country. There are still areas where there are difficulties in obtaining employment. I recognise that. I want to see it improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not mention the phoney figures. The London labour survey showed that there were 150,000 vacancies, but, according to figures from the jobcentres, there were about 78,000 vacancies. Everyone knows that most of vacancies are for slaveshop wages, and we do not expect our unemployed to work for poverty wages. In view of the way in which they have been neglected over the past 10 years, we should do something more positive. We should find them jobs with a minimum wage of £150 a week, and no jobs should be advertised unless they have that financial backing.

The "availability for work" test was clearly the reason for several other clauses, to close the gap so that no one should escape disqualification. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
Government have even calculated how much they will save in a year and how many they think they will catch out who are not available or who have restricted availability. Even disabled people are caught by the provision. That is why I cannot withdraw the amendment and must press for a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
