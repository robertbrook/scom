	<div class='legislation'>Draft Energy Efficiency (Northern Ireland) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Energy Efficiency (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
This is a simple and straightforward order, the purpose of which is to provide a statutory basis for the promotion of energy efficiency in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although such promotional activity has been undertaken by the Departments since the mid 1980s, principally by the Department of Economic Development, so far there has been only limited statutory authority for the expenditure involved. Consequently, Parliamentary approval for that expenditure has been sought annually through appropriation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Audit Office has said that that procedure should not be used in the long term and that, where continuing functions are to be exercised by Departments, the powers and duties should be defined by specific statute. In response, the Department of Economic Development assured the Northern Ireland Audit Office that it would obtain the appropriate legislative cover as soon as is practicable. The order seeks to fulfil that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main provisions of the order are contained in four short, broadly similar articles that deal with the promotion of efficient energy use by industry, by voluntary organisations, in residential accommodation and by public bodies. Each article will enable the relevant Department to take such action as it considers appropriate to the promotion of the efficient use of energy. The means through which that will be achieved include the payment of grants or loans, the giving of advice, the dissemination of information and the carrying out of research. The order will not place new duties or requirements on businesses or individuals, nor will it, in itself, give rise to increased public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a short, hopefully uncontroversial, but necessary order that will fill a gap in current legislation with regard to the promotion of energy efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that, given the anticipated transfer of responsibilities, the order could well be the last Order in Council to be produced by the Department of Economic Development. I am sure that we are all pleased about that prospect and about the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>4.32 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can recognise a plea for an easy ride. Let us hope not only that this is the last order from the DED, but that it is the last of all such orders under the present system. I hope too that the endeavours of the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office come to fruition and that the project is completed in the allotted time. The deadline is looming large but our fingers are crossed, and our hopes and aspirations are with the Minister and his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise two or three small points. The Northern Ireland Audit Office recommended that a single body should act as a conduit for energy efficiency advice and information, and for the issuing of grants. However, the order will divide those responsibilities between two Departments. Under articles 3 and 4, responsibility for such matters will devolve to the DED, but under articles 5 and 6 responsibility will devolve to the Department of the Environment. It is true that the DED and the Department of the Environment will be responsible for different sectors: the former will deal with industry and commerce, and the latter will deal with housing and public bodies. Nevertheless, why, in the light of the recommendation of the Northern Ireland Audit Office, will two Departments be carrying out similar functions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department of the Environment may delegate any of its functions under this Article to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive on such terms and conditions as that Department may determine."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister indicate how such delegation will be organised? If new house building will in the future be the responsibility of housing associations—clearly, all new houses should be as energy efficient as possible—how is that compatible with giving the power to the Housing Executive? I understand that the Housing Executive is responsible for the renovation and upgrade of existing stock—thousands of houses, if not hundreds of thousands, need upgrading for energy efficiency reasons—but has not responsibility for new house building been given to the wrong agency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 deals with promoting energy efficiency in public bodies, which I interpret as including Government Departments of one kind or another. For many years, Government Departments in this country and in Northern Ireland have been given efficiency targets. It would be helpful to know whether those targets are being met, whether some Departments are doing better than others and whether the Government are meeting their overall targets for public bodies. Under article 6, it appears that in the future the Department of the Environment will be responsible for providing financial assistance to any public body that it chooses. Will that mean that other Departments—there will be 10 if devolution happens, and no doubt each will have an individual energy efficiency target—will individually go cap in hand to the Department of the Environment for financial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
assistance? Or will they be expected to pursue energy efficiency by utilising their own resources in the best way possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order goes some way towards tightening up the way in which targets are set and met, not only in Government Departments but in industry and commerce in Northern Ireland. It enables people to identify a source of information and financial assistance, instead of having to approach all Government Departments in the hope that some money will be available. We therefore welcome and support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years, Ulster Unionist Members have decried Orders in Council, but that is in the past. I welcome and wholeheartedly support the order, which will promote energy efficiency in industry, voluntary organisations, residential accommodation and public bodies. Larne borough council has, with support, recently completed a major energy efficiency programme. We believe that it will pay for itself in three to four years, and that it will create considerable savings thereafter. I welcome the fact that grants and loans may be available, and I hope that there will be widespread uptake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed, however, that neither the previous Government nor the present Labour Government have taken the opportunity to fully test the fuel treatment product produced in my constituency by Environmental Engineering Concepts in Larne harbour. The product KD420—or EP4, as it is marketed in this country and elsewhere—reduces the emissions of noxious gases, the need for boiler maintenance and fuel consumption, it pays for itself and it can bring savings. A local leisure complex claims to have made up to 26 per cent. savings in fuel costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to learn yesterday that, after carrying out numerous tests, Portsmouth Council purchased the product. Its use in that region will bring environmental benefits, it will increase energy efficiency and it will produce savings in fuel bills and maintenance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will seize the opportunity to properly examine modern developments and exploit the new technology for the benefit of everyone in the United Kingdom. I welcome the order and fully support its objectives, and I hope that it will further help to promote energy efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.41 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This order, which is short and uncomplicated, is immensely important. How much has been spent on the promotion of energy efficiency in Northern Ireland over the past two or three years? In view of the comprehensive spending review, what is the proposed spending over the next three years? If proper energy efficiency measures are adopted in all the areas that the order details, how many new jobs does the Minister estimate will be created? Will he illustrate the way in which the public sector in Northern Ireland has shown the way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Vast public estates in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, including the health service, the Prison Service, the Post Office, schools and colleges, could set an example in their communities by adopting sensible energy saving measures. Everyone supports such measures, but sometimes not enough action is taken. Such measures need to be promoted—the order's references to promotion involve preaching—but we also need to practise energy efficiency. It is important to make savings but it is also important for public bodies to set an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, I suffered a disappointment involving the Post Office. I tried to interest a Government Department in the fact that the German post office's entire fleet was going to be converted to energy-saving electric battery propulsion. My letter whizzed its way round Whitehall without landing on anyone's desk for more than four minutes because the subject was nobody's responsibility. However, it is everyone's responsibility. Foolishly, I thought that the Minister for Energy and Industry would take up the matter and visit the Departments that are concerned with energy savings to ensure that the matter was dealt with properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To pursue the point that was made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), will the Government use the order to show in Northern Ireland how the rest of the United Kingdom could get joined-up government by ensuring that all Departments work in the same direction and with the same objective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.44 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) misunderstood the order's purpose. Perhaps I did not explain it properly. It puts in place the legislative framework to allow the expenditure to take place. It is not a new initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know. It is a renewing initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was highlighted that it should not be implemented through appropriation orders. I hope to put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest by providing a full explanation which will show how active we are in all sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) answered his own question about the split between the DED and the DOE. The DED is responsible for industry and the DOE is responsible for housing and housing policy. Two major spending routes are available to allocate money for specific needs. The Industrial Research and Technology Unit, which is an agency of the DED, understands the needs of industry better than the DOE but it would not understand the housing issue, and vice versa. We are trying to create the best advice through promotional activities and to provide practical assistance to industry, the residential sector and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the Housing Executive's responsibility for energy efficiency and how that relates to housing associations. The Housing Executive is the home energy conservation authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
for Northern Ireland. It works closely with housing associations which are trained to promote energy efficiency. People who erect new build are more aware of the need to maximise energy efficiency, We want to provide the best delivery mechanism to filter specialist knowledge through the various layers to ensure that there is best promotion and best practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification, but I should like to probe a little more. I understand that the Housing Executive has that responsibility. Indeed, I mentioned that it will be involved in energy efficiency when it refurbishes existing stock. But who will be responsible for ensuring that new build houses, which will be provided through housing associations and not the Housing Executive, comply with the highest energy efficiency standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be achieved through the promotion of best practice; it will not be based on instructions issued to building constructors. We must decide how to maximise best practice within the new build sector. The Housing Executive works closely with housing associations and is involved in the promotion of energy efficiency. It may even be a case of involving residents. There can always be improved means. For example, it may become apparent after a house is built that a type of fuel could be used more efficiently. It is a constant process to ensure that best practice is adopted. The responsibility for that rests with the Housing Executive and the DOE, which are also responsible for providing best information to those who are building houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also asked about departmental responsibilities for energy efficiency. Departments are responsible for their own energy efficiency programmes, but a unique programme is in place in Northern Ireland. A central fund allocates an additional £2.5 million to the Northern Ireland departments. It has been available for some time, which picks up on a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Erdington about what is happening in Northern Ireland. A programme is looking at central Government buildings and at a new funding route to move the programme forward. The target is to obtain a 20 per cent. improvement in efficiency by 2000 compared with when the programme commenced in 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the various Departments—there are six at present—bid for money from the £2.5 million in the central fund for their energy efficiency projects? Will the DOE in future be responsible, under article 6, for distributing the money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that it is delivered through the Department of Finance and Personnel, which is effectively the Treasury within the territorial Department of Northern Ireland. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Departments will be reshaped: instead of six, there will be 10, and there will be a central Department under the auspices of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
organisation of the finances will rest with them, but the principle will be similar to that which applies at present. There will be a central pocket of money for which Departments will bid. It will not simply be a case of dividing the amount by six, because some Departments have more buildings than others or older buildings, and therefore have greater need. The delivery mechanism must clearly be through the central treasury, and, as defined in the order, the DOE is at present responsible for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) asked about KD420, or EP4. That is a complex issue. I stand to be corrected, but I think that I have written to him recently about that. If not, I apologise for inadvertently giving the Committee the wrong information. The product has been examined, but assessing it and how it is to be used is a technical matter. I shall write in detail to the hon. Gentleman and to other members of the Committee who are interested in the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the way in which Northern Ireland Departments go about their business is that it would be most unusual for them to miss an opportunity to improve energy efficiency and more particularly for them not to seize the opportunity to create more jobs if a company is making something that is being purchased elsewhere. If that is not happening, I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman about it in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response, but there is a conflict when information that is sent out simply says "Fuel additives don't work". If that is a Government or a departmental edict, it rules out the possibility of anybody looking at the matter seriously. We find benefits from this product in industry, schools and elsewhere, and the issue must be addressed seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who deal with these matters scientifically cannot explain, understand or find good reason why the product works and it should be tested as thoroughly as possible and then either written off or approved. I do not believe that that has happened yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will be aware that claims can be made about the efficacy and relative strengths of innovative products, but if expenditure is to be involved, a proper assessment must take place. I do not have enough information to hand to say what testing or assessment has taken place to prompt the edict. That is why I said that I would investigate the matter and come back with an answer. Simply because a company is marketing a product does not mean that it is better than other products on the market, nor that it is the best use of public money or the most efficient use of fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am being lobbied in my constituency by a company which is involved in the production of fuel additives, so I have some knowledge of the claims being made by that company. I assure the hon. Member for East Antrim that I shall take the best scientific assessment before I start promoting it as the best and only method of energy efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I am advised that no policy statement has been issued by the Government saying that fuel additives do not work. I do not know where that edict came from, but I shall certainly investigate. If the hon. Gentleman will let me have the document to which he referred, I shall check that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall budget, just over £5 million has been allocated from different sources. Another fund was available in the energy sector but it had not been specified how the money should be allocated and there has been much debate on that. One of my first actions on taking office was to take a tranche of that money—£5 million—and to allocate it for energy efficiency use. Schemes are being worked out for ways of using it. It has been transferred to the DOE and there will be one pilot scheme, followed shortly afterwards by two full-blown schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been active in trying to maximise the available money to ensure that the best schemes are applied. I am not saying that we are doing everything
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that should be done or that everything is being done in the best way, but we are trying to achieve that objective and to improve on what has been achieved.

My hon. Friend the Member for Erdington was right in saying that more attention should be given to the matter, because it is an important part of overall energy use in the United Kingdom. We should always be considering new ways of finding money and new ways in which to spend it for the purposes which my hon. Friend set out.
