	<div class='legislation'>Draft Public Lending Right (Increase of Limit) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Alan Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Public Lending Right (Increase of Limit) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
This is the first time, Mrs. Michie, that I have had the opportunity to sit under your Chairmanship—I take pleasure in doing so. I am confident that under your benign but firm guidance, this vessel will be steered safely into port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that after the fairly turbulent debate in the 1970s which led up to the passing of the Public Lending Right Act 1979, it is fair to say that the public lending right has been supported by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Following a 30-year campaign by authors for some form of reward for the loan of their books—free—from public libraries, the Act conferred on them a new right of payment in respect of loans to public library users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the passing of the PLR Act in the United Kingdom, the European Union passed a directive in 1992 requiring all member states to provide a scheme of equitable remuneration for authors whose books are lent by public libraries or to introduce a scheme of exclusive rights over the lending of their books. The PLR scheme meets that requirement, so we have pioneered a principle that is now widely accepted in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1979 Act established a scheme under which authors throughout the United Kingdom are paid out of a central fund, which also covers the scheme's administration costs. It is supported with money voted by Parliament. This year, the replacement of an ageing computer system added to the scheme's administrative expenditure, which would have left less money available for authors. The result would have been a decline in the rate per loan. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was pleased to be able to find extra funding to maintain the fund at £5 million and thereby maintain a rate per loan of 2.07p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Public Lending Right Act 1979, an increase in the fund requires an order to be laid before the House of Commons and approved by affirmative resolution before the start of the financial year in which the increase is to take place. The last order, which increased the limit to £5 million, was approved in 1992. The order that we are considering authorises an increase in the upper limit of the fund from £5 million to £5.5 million. Within that upper limit, the Government have proposed year-on-year increases
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
over the next three years, up to slightly more than £5.2 million in 2001–02. That will allow the registrar to maintain—or even increase—the rate per loan to authors and to work with my Department to take forward and develop the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I explain to the Committee how the rate per loan is established. Administrative costs are subtracted from the overall budget, leaving the remainder for distribution to authors. In recent years, the registrar, Dr. Jim Parker, has sought with admirable success to reduce operational costs, freeing more of the fund to be distributed to authors. A representative sample of public libraries from 30 local authorities is surveyed, giving an estimate of the total number of loans of registered books across the country. The funds available for authors are divided by the total number of loans to give the rate per loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rate per loan of 2.07p may not seem much, but it is a recognition of the principle that authors should have the right to receive payment for the loan of their books from public libraries. We know from the many letters sent to the registrar that authors recognise that; they welcome the payments and the feedback that the scheme gives them on the popularity of their books with library users. I also know that authors appreciate the efficient and effective way in which the registrar and his staff operate the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total number of authors registering for PLR has risen steadily over the years. This year, £4.1 million was available for authors, and 17,000 authors received a payment. While 93 authors qualified for the maximum payment of £6,000, the larger part of the fund goes to the less well-known and up-and-coming authors, which is a significant means of encouraging creativity and developing talent. It is a way in which the Government can recognise the contribution that authors make to our public libraries, to the cultural life of the country and to our literary prestige abroad. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.35 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the Minister's comments on your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie. I also thank the Minister for so courteously and comprehensively explaining the order. I assure him that we have no objection to it and will certainly not oppose it. It is an unexceptional measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the increase is from £5 million to £5.5 million with effect from 1999–2000. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify one point—if not now, then perhaps in a note to me. The House of Commons Library points out that the £5.5 million will include administrative costs, so it is not clear how much of the increase will be directly available to authors. Will the Minister clarify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the Society of Authors considers the public lending right to be good and efficient. It campaigned for about 30 years prior to the legislation being introduced in 1979. There is an echo of the provision in the EU directive of 1992, and it appears to have worked well and have been well received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
There is an irony in the matter. Those who observe the arts and literary scene know that the local library is a focus of community activity that is well valued around the country in all sorts of different communities. In the national year of reading, we are threatened with an unprecedented list of possible library closures. I know that the Minister is aware that, and has pointed out the statutory responsibility of local authorities in that regard. He will know that all London's 33 boroughs have been ordered at the request of the Department to review their libraries as part of the general spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the closure of libraries is a soft option when local authorities are under spending pressure. In every corner of the country, there is enormous pressure for libraries to close, reduce their hours or cut their staffing levels. That arises from what is perceived to be the inadequate local government settlement made by the Government. It is indeed an irony that it was at the moment when national library week was announced that the problem of closures arose in London—most notably in the constituency of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to support the order, as we believe that it provides an effective bridge between libraries and authors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Had you finished, Mr. Spring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, thank you, Mrs. Michie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.55 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the proposal and I have only one or two questions. The Minister explained that the £5.5 million is less the total of any sums paid in a year. But what is the average of those items that make up the amount, which is, of course, the less amount? Does the Minister comprehend? An average amount must have been deducted over the past few years before the authors got their share. The £5.5 million allows for 2.07p per author per loan. Is there uncertainty about the rate? Will authors know about it at the beginning, the middle or the end of the financial year? A new author will want to budget and to take into account what might happen with the lending libraries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, more reading is done in children's libraries—on which I am very keen—than in any other part of a library. Are authors whose books are in children's libraries recompensed if they are well used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.56 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their generous welcome for the principle of the authors' public lending right scheme and for their willingness to endorse the proposed changes. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
asked practical questions about the operation of the system. The hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) asked how much of the £5.5 million upper limit will be available for authors. We do not propose to go to the upper limit immediately, but out of the expenditure that we do envisage, £4.2 million will be available for authors in 1999–2000, £4.5 million in 2000–01 and £4.5 million again in 2001–02.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) asked about running costs. The average annual expenditure on running costs has been 12 per cent., which he might think is high, but the registrar has sought successfully to contain, control, limit and reduce administrative costs as a proportion of total spending. Administrative costs will always be a sizeable percentage because the scheme is designed to provide an equitable entitlement for a large number of authors. There is a maximum benefit of £6,000 a year that authors may receive from the public lending right. That has been set relatively low to achieve a redistributive function—I hope that my hon. Friends do not think it inappropriate to use that term—to distribute more widely the fund's benefits to a greater range of authors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unit costs per author are relatively high. That is why the staff who administer the system have been extremely determined to keep operational costs to a minimum. Ironically, that is also one of the reasons why we must have a new computer system, which will enable the scheme to operate more economically and cost-effectively, in the interests of authors, although the initial costs of installing such a system are higher than is welcome. However, I assure the Committee that we are keeping a tight control on the costs. Again, I commend the Registrar and his staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may also interest the Committee to know that the PLR advisory committee is reflecting, at our request, on several areas of possible policy development. I should like to pay tribute to that committee and express my special thanks to its chairman, Mr. Michael Holroyd, for the valuable work that it does. The committee is considering two issues in particular. The first is whether the loan of non-book materials, such as spoken word recordings, should be included in the PLR scheme, given their importance to people who are visually impaired and to elderly people. The second issue is whether PLR should be extended to authors resident elsewhere in the European Union. I am looking forward to hearing the opinions of the advisory committee and considering how the scheme could be improved and brought more up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Suffolk succumbed to the temptation to extend the debate—I trust that he was in order, Mrs. Michie—to consider the condition of the public library service. Let me assure the Committee that the Government are absolutely committed to a comprehensive and efficient library service and we intend to ensure that we fulfil our statutory obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the season in which local authorities, as library authorities, are planning their budgets. In fact, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was able to announce, the public expenditure settlement for local government applies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
from this April, and is the best settlement for seven years. We simply do not accept that local authorities will not have the resources to meet their statutory obligations under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined that local libraries should remain at the heart of our communities. Our literary heritage should be available to everyone who wants to study or enjoy it, and public libraries offer users an exciting range of services. Of course, the information technology revolution is transforming the library service, and there is, justifiably, much excitement and optimism in the library profession. At the same time, we must never forget that, as far as we can foresee—certainly, as far as I wish to foresee—books will remain at the heart of the library service. However, we insist that library authorities must have the resources to fulfil their statutory obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have required library authorities to produce annual library plans, the first of which we received following the exercise that was conducted last year. It proved to be both valuable and encouraging. However, we have asked those library authorities whose plans have not given us the confidence that we would have hoped to reconsider. I am confident that, using that planning instrument, we shall encourage a more coherent and purposeful policy development. So I refute the suggestion made by the hon. Member for West Suffolk that we are experiencing some sort of crisis in the public library system. We are determined to ensure that our public libraries continue to offer the comprehensive and efficient service that they are obliged to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to test your patience, Mrs. Michie, but I want to stress that it is not my hon. Friends and I who are making the point about a crisis in the system; it is being made by local authorities of every political persuasion throughout the country. The Library Association has said that the scale of the latest cuts is unusually high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Minister with care, but there is genuine concern that, given the settlement and the additional responsibilities of local government, libraries will not be the first to be hit. Therefore, I ask the Minister not to talk about imposing the statutory responsibility, but to be realistic about the financial plight of local authorities, given their additional responsibilities, which is causing not only the Library Association but local authorities and hon. Members such concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is remarkable that the hon. Gentleman dares to talk about the financial plight of local authorities, given the previous Administration's treatment of local government. That is a matter of objective, verifiable fact. The current settlement for local authorities is the best they have had in the past seven years. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to all library authorities, reminding them of their obligation. I can only reaffirm to the Committee that we take our responsibilities seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still a member of a local authority, which is just going through a budget process. I know that, at least in the north of England, an average of £20,000 has been taken from book funds for social services, education and so on. As a result of that, most people are again saying that this is a Cinderella service. Can it now have a high profile? I see signs that, through the Secretary of State, the library service is beginning to have a much higher profile and I hope that that will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on my feet, I remind the Minister that he did not answer my question about children's books. I go in and listen to children reading. There are sometimes 10 words in a book and the authors get 2.07p. I hope that they do, but is that the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister respond briefly to the first point and then return to the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Mrs. Michie, I defer to your wisdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman noted and appreciated the stand that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has recently taken in writing to local authorities. We very much deprecate any reduction in book funds. The hon. Gentleman might agree that the sensible view to adopt is that the public library service is complementary to the education service and that, if we are interested in promoting the education service and running better education services, it would be perverse to erode it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall seek to distinguish between the process where a library authority is constructively restructuring its library service to modernise and improve it—that can involve awkward retrenchments and unpopular local decisions—and the process where a local authority takes the view that it does not have the resources to sustain its library service and therefore starts to cut a service that it has a statutory obligation to sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had been about to come to the hon. Gentleman's point about children's books. We all welcome the fact that, in this national year of reading, loans of children's books from public libraries are increasing. My Department is working with the Department for Education and Employment to promote that initiative. My Department has also provided start-up funding of £10,000 for the children's laureate scheme, which will continue after the year of reading ends. That demonstrates the Government's commitment to raising the standards of cultural education, and in particular to broadening access for this and future generations to a rich and varied cultural life. I assure the hon. Gentleman that children's books qualify for PLR payments, regardless of their page length.

The public lending right celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. It is a tribute to former and present registrars and their staff, as well as to all the librarians who support our public library service, that it has been such a success story. Not only is it valued by authors in this country; it is held in high regard abroad. I know that countries elsewhere in Europe and the rest of the world are keen to learn from our experience.
