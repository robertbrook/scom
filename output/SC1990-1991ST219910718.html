	<div class='legislation'>Draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Dr. Brian Mawhinney)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
A draft of the order was laid before the House on 10 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the order is to give effect to two of Lord Colville's recommendations in his review of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts 1978 and 1987. Those matters are more appropriately dealt with by order in council, as they involve amendment of the general criminal law of Northern Ireland, and are not confined to the emergency law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two recommendations are those in paragraph 7.3 of Lord Colville's report, on remands into police custody, and paragraph 16.4 on the copying of documentary exhibits in committal proceedings. The Government are also taking the opportunity provided by the draft order to make a number of minor amendments to existing criminal justice legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 of the draft order would empower magistrates courts to remand accused persons to detention in police custody for questioning about other offences. That provision brings the law in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales, where magistrates courts already have such powers. The Government hope that the provision will reduce the time that suspects must be detained for questioning under the PACE legislation and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) 1984 and 1989 Acts before being charged and brought before a magistrates' court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that, for a number of years, Lord Colville has expressed concern about the practice of extending the detention of some terrorist suspects under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act in circumstances where there may already be sufficient evidence to prefer charges, in order to enable the police to investigate other offences of which the person is suspected. Such circumstances have arisen where the individual was caught red handed or where he made a confession. That was the principal reason why Lord Colville recommended that provision should be made in Northern Ireland, similar to that in England and Wales, for a remand of an accused person into police custody for up to three days. The Government's intention is that such individuals should, if possible, be charged at an earlier stage, and then brought before a magistrates' court, where the police should seek a remand back into police custody in order to question
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the accused about other offences. Lord Colville has welcomed the Government's intention to bring forward the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 of the order provides the prosecution with the discretion, in connection with a preliminary inquiry, either to serve the accused with a copy of a written exhibit or to furnish such information as may be necessary to enable the defence to examine the exhibit. In paragraph 16.4 of his Northern Ireland report on the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts 1978 and 1987, Lord Colville refers to a problem that was drawn to his attention by the Director of Public Prosecutions. As the law stands in Northern Ireland, if the prosecution intends to request the court to conduct a preliminary inquiry, the prosecution is required to cause copies of certain documents to be furnished to the court and served on the accused. By virtue of article 31 of the Magistrates' Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, those documents include a copy of any written exhibit. The requirement to serve a copy of a written exhibit is mandatory, and that is the cause of the difficulty, because if the written exhibit contains sensitive or confidential information, there may be good reason why it should not be served on the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Colville noted that in England and Wales, section 102 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 provides that the prosecution may either serve a copy of a documentary exhibit or furnish such information as may be necessary to enable the accused to inspect the document or a copy of it. Lord Colville recommended that that provision should be replicated in Northern Ireland. Article 4 of the order makes the necessary provision for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend that copies of written exhibits should continue to be served on the accused in the usual way, and only in exceptional circumstances should copies be denied. That will not involve any infringement of the accused's rights. The accused's rights are protected by the requirement for the prosecution to serve notice of where and when written exhibits may be examined by the defence, in cases where those exhibits are not served. That is again a sensible provision, which brings the law in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales. We hope that it will be welcomed by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 extends the time limit for a claim for compensation under the Criminal Injuries (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 by a person who was under 18 when the injury was sustained. That provision is required to remove an anomaly created by an amendment to the 1977 order by the Criminal Injuries (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. The anomaly could, in certain circumstances, place minors who were criminally injured before the 1988 order came into effect, at a disadvantage relative to those injured after it came into effect. There are probably few such cases, but as they involve violence to children and young persons, including sexual abuse, we have concluded that the anomaly created by the 1988 order should be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 makes minor technical amendments to extra-territorial legislation, consequential to the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Article 7 amends the Probation Board (Northern Ireland) Order 1982 to clarify the probation board's powers to fund schemes run by voluntary organisations for the prevention of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders. It is not clear whether the current statutory powers in the 1982 order are sufficiently wide to authorise that practice. The new provision is intended to remove any doubt. The article also clarifies and extends the powers of the Secretary of State in relation to inspections of the probation board and of services provided by voluntary organisations in connection with the board's activities. The purpose of such inspections is to ensure that the quality of service provided meets the required standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order was generally welcomed by those local politicians, human rights groups, and others who made comments. For example, the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights supported the proposal, and welcomed the Government's decision that both Lord Colville's recommendations should be incorporated into the general criminal law, as distinct from the emergency legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston upon Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We give a general welcome to the order. Its intention is to liberalise the law and to help accused persons in custody, and it follows Lord Colville's recommendations, in part, if not in toto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main provision is contained in article 3, and it allows accused persons to be remanded in police custody for questioning about other offences. It partially follows a recommendation of Lord Colville and it brings Northern Ireland legislation into line with that of England and Wales in this respect. The Government argue that it is a liberalising measure in that it will encourage the police to bring charges as soon as possible rather than using the powers of detention in the Prevention of Terrorism Temporary Provisions Acts 1984 and 1989 to hold people for questioning. They claim that the order will reduce the number of extended detentions under the prevention of terrorism acts. If that is what will happen it is to be welcomed. The order will also increase the supervision of the courts over the detention process, which again, we welcome. Once a person has been charged, any subsequent remand in police custody would be governed by the PACE provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the order's intent is welcome, a number of issues arise. First, I have a general comment, which might be regarded as "begrudgery" or carping. Why has it taken so long to extend the provisions to Northern Ireland when the English equivalents date from the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984? Why were not the provisions included in the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989? It smacks of legislative improvisation, but, nevertheless, we welcome the proposed package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will ensure that an accused paramilitary who is remanded in police custody will be held under the PACE conditions of detention as set out in articles
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
40 and 41 of the PACE order and the relevant codes of practice. That raises an interesting question. If a suspected terrorist can be interrogated under the PACE conditions after he has been charged, why do not the PACE provisions apply during the pre-remand detention period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some clarification and assurance about the operation of the order would be helpful. Will the Minister confirm that anyone remanded in police custody will be questioned only in a holding centre or a designated police station? The order also specifies that the purpose of remand in police custody is to permit questioning about other offences that the accused may have committed. Will there be safeguards to ensure that such questioning will not become a trawling exercise that is designed to secure evidence to sustain the original charges?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order seems to place no limitations on the number of occasions on which an accused may be remanded in police custody. How does the Minister envisage that that will operate in practice? How will the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1991–which removes the right to silence in certain circumstances, or puts it under major constraints, at least—apply during periods of remand?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will know that Lord Colville's recommendation on the matter was somewhat wider than the version that is presented in the order. Lord Colville argued that such questioning in police custody should be recorded on video. When will the videoing of interrogations be introduced? The Government have strongly set their mind against that, and it appears that the RUC has as well. However, it would be a tremendous protection for the accused and the police, for several reasons, which I shall not spell out here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the three-day remand period be in addition to the present maximum periods of police detention—four days under PACE and seven days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act—or will it be an alternative to police detention? I believe that the Government do not intend it to be an addition to police detention. However, I do not see how the Government's intention is reflected in the order. We need a firm assurance from the Government on that matter, so that courts and others who seek to use the powers can take the Government's intention on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want an assurance from the Minister about the practical consequences of article 4. As the Minister explained, the prosecution will no longer have to provide copies of documentary exhibits to the defence during preliminary inquiries. Will he confirm that the defence will have proper access to all such exhibits? The Minister suggested that that would be the case. However, we need a firm commitment before a case is brought to trial. We do not want the recurrence of cases such as those in England, where the defence has been denied vital evidence. As a result, people wrongly accused of offences have been incarcerated in gaol for long periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the changes in compensation provisions, which will be brought about by article 5. I hope that the Minister will keep the matter under review, particularly to ensure that compensation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
claims are settled speedily and justly. There is much grievance about the time that it takes for a person to receive compensation. I appreciate that in injury cases, for example, one needs to decide how long the injury will last. It is important that a partial sum be paid, if not the full amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to article 6, we welcome the addition of arson and interference with railways to the list of offences within the scope of the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975. I should like to make two points with regard to that article. The Opposition have frequently expressed the view that the fact that an offender is brought to book is much more important than where he is brought to justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where extradition is possible or appropriate, we support it. Where extra-territorial legislation is more effective, it should be used. Indeed, it is a source of regret to us that more use has not been made of the criminal jurisdiction legislation, particularly because it has been more effective than attempts at extradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition of the offence of interference with railways is aptly timed. The IRA's campaign against the Belfast-Dublin rail link demonstrates, in a particularly revealing fashion, the absurdity of that organisation's strategy. It talks about a united Ireland but tries to break the main link between the two capitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to welcome the arrival of the peace train in London tomorrow. Let us hope that the travellers have a pleasant journey and an agreeable crossing, and that the IRA does not threaten to prevent their arrival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final part of the order deals with the probation service. We welcome the provision that allows the probation board to assist the voluntary sector in dealing with offenders. I am sure that the Minister wishes to associate himself with a tribute to the good work of members of the probation service and of voluntary organisations such as the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Rehabilitation of Offenders. We hope that the proposed inspector will assist in advancing the work of the probation service and of the voluntary sector, which is of particular importance in the troubled situation in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, we welcome the order and shall not oppose it. We hope that the Minister will be able to answer our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), we shall not oppose the order. I wish to comment and to ask questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister may expect, my first comment is, as usual, on the procedure that led to the order. I refer to legislation by way of Order in Council which, as everyone knows, is an inferior procedure in that it limits debate and excludes the possibility of tabling amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it ironic that the Minister justified the use of the procedure on the ground that the provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
were amending the general criminal law and for that reason were excluded from the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1991. Its Committee debates were lengthy and they allowed considerable opportunity for amendments to be tabled. Many were tabled in order to probe related matters as well as those in the Bill, even though the Bill contained provisions that were expected to be temporary. The proper procedures were used on that occasion for temporary legislation. But for what is intended to be permanent legislation, we go through this debased and inferior procedure. This is the only occasion on which there will be serious debate on the subject in Parliament. A list of members of the Committee will be published, and the public will see that representatives from Northern Ireland were reduced to one—me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification commonly given for legislating in this way is the supposed need to maintain what is called the integrity of the Northern Ireland statute book. I commented on that in the House earlier this week. It is entirely false. What is called the Northern Ireland statute book is no such thing; it is simply a volume containing all the Orders in Council made under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1991. It would be much more honest to title it in that way. There is no Northern Ireland statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is good reason to compile one, and someone ought seriously to consider it. I am thinking of a volume containing legislation enacted in a given year, and applying specifically to Northern Ireland as distinct from general legislation that applies to the United Kingdom as a whole. Such a volume would contain the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act for the appropriate year, as well as the Orders in Council. Both are primary legislation, both have precisely the same effect in the courts, and both are equally important to practitioners. There would be logic in that, and justification, whereas, at present under the misleading title, Northern Ireland statutes, there is merely a list of Orders in Council. That is a more general point, but we ought to be able to consider general points of that nature from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another such issue is that the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 covers a grand total of seven pages. Two days ago, we considered a Criminal Justice Bill containing 97 pages. Presumably its provisions were those that the Government consider it appropriate for Parliament to consider and enact. None of those provisions is in the order, and that gives rise to one of my questions. What do the Government intend to do with these criminal justice provisions that are currently being enacted and are considered suitable for Great Britain? They are important provisions, and we have been told that the reason for enacting them is to bring the law, in some respects, into line with the requirements of the European convention. The requirements of that convention apply not just to Great Britain but to Northern Ireland. Until similar legislation is enacted for Northern Ireland, there may be some difficulties with that convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will equivalent provisions be introduced to Northern Ireland and when? The "when" is equally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
important and is tied to the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North about the time that it takes for legislation in Northern Ireland to be brought into line with that in Great Britain. Must we wait between seven and 11 years for equivalent legislation to be made for Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important matter. It would not be justifiable to explain the delay or the failure to implement equivalent provisions in Northern Ireland on the grounds that provisions here will apply only to what in Northern Ireland parlance are "ordinary, decent criminals". There are some "ordinary, decent criminals" in Northern Ireland and their rights are just as important as those of criminals in Great Britain who may or may not, for the purpose of this argument, be ordinary and decent. However, that is another matter. The point is a serious one, but I shall not delay our proceedings, although we have two hours to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Late last night I toyed with the possibility of going through the provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill in detail and specifically asking the Minister why each of them is not provided for in Northern Ireland, but I thought that that would weary the Committee. However, there is an important general point. There is good reason for some of the provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill, and we need to know when we shall have equivalent provisions in Northern Ireland. That should not be long delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to the general point about Order in Council procedure, which delays legislation for Northern Ireland. We are told that the Northern Ireland parliamentary draftsmen feel that they cannot start work on a Northern Ireland Order in Council intended to be equivalent to Great Britain legislation until the Great Britain legislation is in its final form and has reached the statute book, and that that produces an in-built delay of a couple of years before Orders in Council come forward. I am amazed that the in-built delay is as long as that, but that seems to be borne out by experience. Therefore, the Order in Council procedure builds in delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why one cannot provide for the equivalent procedure at an earlier stage and have the Northern Ireland equivalents contained in the legislation. That would not require more work in the legislative draftsmen's office in Belfast. It could be done earlier, if the effort were made. The catch-up would have to be done only once, and then we could have legislation in a better form with the opportunity to debate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of specific matters in the order, I shall not comment on article 3. Comments have already been made on that and there is nothing that I wish to add.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reasoning behind article 4. The Minister said, as Lord Colville said in his report, that the intention was to protect sensitive and confidential information. It is right to protect such information. We know that when one of their members is apprehended, terrorist organisations are anxious to ascertain how that person got caught. Often, they find that out from the exhibits that are presented and they then know how to change their operating
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
procedures to ensure that others do not get caught. There is also other sensitive information, such as that referred to by the Minister and by Lord Colville in his report. I entirely agree that such information should be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North made a good point when he sought assurances about how article 4 should operate. If the intention is to use the discretion to withhold information only in exceptional circumstances—I believe that the Minister used that phrase—and the exceptional circumstances are when there is sensitive or confidential information, why not say that in the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislative provision is now being changed from a requirement to disclose material to a discretion to withhold all material—yet we are told that discretion will not be exercised in all cases, only in certain cases. Surely the purpose of legislation is to state what will and ought to happen, but the order merely gives a blanket discretion to the authorities to withhold all information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be the Government's intention that that power should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances. However, the anxiety expressed by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North is perfectly legitimate. Government intentions are not always fulfilled, and they sometimes change. Where there is strong political impetus to obtain convictions—not just where there is sensitive or confidential information—procedure and behaviour might well fall below the expected standards. We all know of cases where that has happened. It is a real danger, and it would be better for the order to take account of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already debated in the Emergency Provisions Bill Committee the issue of video recordings. The Minister knows my views on that. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North referred to interference with railways. However, I do not agree that the provision is timely. It is long overdue. The railways problem really started a long time ago—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are speaking about Northern Ireland Railways rather than British Rail, but for purposes of amendment to the timetable, I accept the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that Her Majesty's Government are engaged in discussions to make the principal rail routes—designated European routes—to Northern Ireland run through Dublin. Predictably, Dublin will be anxious to ensure that the route goes through Dublin; it will not be anxious to ensure that it proceeds further north. That is the usual way for Dublin. The Republic's Government will be happy to con Her Majesty's Government into adopting a transport policy that can be used by them and their allies—allies is perhaps too strong a word—or those who share the same objectives as the Provisional IRA to cut off and harm the Northern Ireland economy. I would not be surprised if the Government and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Northern Ireland Office were complicit in that scheme, which will damage the Northern Ireland economy. However, that is an issue for another day. I hope that it will be properly debated on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, in general we welcome these modest provisions. We just wonder why they are so modest and why they do not contain equivalents of other legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.57 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mawhinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Members for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) and for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble). They both raised questions which I shall attempt to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would never occur to me to suggest that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North would even contemplate "begrudgery", never mind indulge in it. However, in case he is tempted, may I say that the order is not an afterthought. The Government considered including the provision in the 1989 order to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Indeed, we went further and took advice from the RUC and from the Northern Ireland Courts Service—both of whom felt that further legislation was unnecessary. However, Lord Colville came to a different judgment, so we reconsidered and, in the light of his recommendations, we decided to act. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that We tried to be rigorous in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confirm what he asked—that reference would be either to a police station or a holding centre. I can also confirm that there is no sense of this being a trawling-for-evidence exercise. Individuals would have to return to magistrates courts within three days, which is a limitation. The courts can, of course, hear evidence from the defence as well as from the prosecution. There is also a requirement on the police, when the need no longer exists, to bring the individual back to the magistrates court—even if it is before the time of expiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that there was no limit to the number of times that someone could be referred to a magistrates court, which is right. We judge that magistrates courts should determine each case on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made his views about videoing clear today, in the same way that he did earlier in the year in Committee, as did the hon. Member for Upper Bann. I also made the Government's views clear, and I do not think that our position has changed since those extended debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North asked whether article 3 was an alternative to executive decision making. In theory, the answer is no. In practice, as the hon. Gentleman knows, we hope that the enactment of the provision will reduce the time that it is necessary for people to be detained under an executive order because, as he said, all other things being equal, it is better for the judicial process to be effective rather than the executive one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about safeguards. When someone is arrested under the ordinary
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
criminal law and taken to a police station, the detention would be subject to the provisions of the PACE order, including the codes of practice issued under that order. That is his protection. If someone is in a holding centre after arrest under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, the detention will be subject to the provisions of schedule 3 of the PTA, which deals with the supervision of detention. In such cases, police interviews with the accused will be covered by closed-circuit television monitoring. Therefore, safeguards are built in under both arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under article 4, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North asked whether the defence would have access to the evidence. I can confirm that that is so. I am happy to join the hon. Gentleman in expressing appreciation not only of the work of the probation board in Northern Ireland, but also of those voluntary organisations which play an important role in assisting in the general work of the probation service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Upper Bann made clear, in a wholly constructive way, his views on the Order in Council process. That is a wider debate beyond this measure, but by not responding to the hon. Gentleman's comments in detail I do not wish him to think that I have not heard and noted what he said. He makes a fair point about the Criminal Justice Bill. I can tell him that similar measures are under consideration in Northern Ireland, but I cannot give him a timetable at the moment. He is right to point out that there are matters in that Bill which are of significance throughout the United Kingdom. I will do two things. I will draw his concern to the attention of my noble Friend the Paymaster-General, who has primary responsibility for security matters in Northern Ireland, and when I have some idea about the timetable I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major point made by the hon. Gentleman was on article 4. He said that it might have been better to seek to legislate for the discretion rather than to make the discretion wide, with the presumption that normal processes would be followed. I understand that point. The normal processes in England and Wales would be the written evidence, and part of the idea here is to bring Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales in that. The difficulty in seeking to legislate exemptions is that one can never be absolutely sure that all legitimate exemptions are covered. If they are not covered, difficulties will arise and procedures that the hon. Gentleman and I would not want would have to be followed. Alternatively, we would have to return to the matter and legislate to close loopholes. While I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, I hope that he will agree that, ultimately, the important issue is to safeguard the rights of the defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's point. However, it is unfortunate that when such an awkward decision has to be made and an awkward balance drawn, that it is drawn, as often happens in favour of the convenience of the Government and the prosecuting authorities rather than in favour of the accused by having the balance and the onus shifted more towards disclosure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that I have dealt with all substantive questions raised by the hon. Members for Kingston upon Hull, North and for Upper Bann. This is a worthwhile measure that will benefit the community in Northern Ireland as well as those who face
