	<div class='member'>The Minister For Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Committee last met, I have had the opportunity to take professional advice about the new clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) in that I had lunch with seven of the partners of a leading firm of City accountants. I asked them for their view about the new clause because, as my hon. Friend knows, I never want to be unfair to him. As I said at the opening of my remarks, he is a fount of interesting ideas and has many very good
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
ideas about the reform of company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have to tell my hon. Friend that they confirmed me in the view that I was expressing when I was closing my remarks this morning. They felt that what my hon. Friend was asking them to do was not something which they were really equipped or would wish to do. I refer to the point which my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) raised about professional indemnity. The problems which accountants already have for covering themselves against that work, which my hon. Friend described as preparing last year's Bradshaw, are very considerable. The problems of the crystal ball game are very considerable, and they simply did not believe that this was work which they should be asked to do. But they pointed out that most companies have a finance director, and this is precisely the sort of function that he rather than the auditors ought to be carrying out. To put the duty on the auditor, who is a strictly part-time connection or officer of the company, is unfair and something that they are not there to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend also remind our hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) that there are public companies that are small? I referred to an example this morning, Bio-Kil Laboratories, which is in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again my hon. Friend has made a most valuable intervention. However, for the reasons which I explained this morning, I must advise my hon. Friends to reject this new clause if my hon. Friend decides to put it to the vote. In doing so, the Government are not being bloody-minded or stick-in-the-mud. I really do not believe that this would add anything of any value to the body of company law, and I believe it is putting an unfair duty on the auditor. Therefore, Sir Stephen, I have no alternative but to advise my hon. Friends to resist the new clause if my hon. Friend decides to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear about the consultations which my hon. Friend has put in hand already on the subject of my proposal. I am always encouraged by small things, and I hope that my optimism does not carry me into an unreal world. I believe, though, that small stones eventually start large

	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
avalanches, and if I have been able to provoke an interesting discussion amongst such august people, then perhaps something will come of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two points which have been raised this morning and just now with which I should like to deal as briefly as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of the indemnity, or the protection of directors and auditors, I certainly do not think that we in this country want to drift into the position in which prominent business people find themselves in the United States where they are exposed often to personally crippling legal proceedings. I said this morning that I thought we should remember all the time that when discussing company law, limited liability provided the House with the obligation to legislate in such a way that the body of company law ensured reasonable protection for those concerned, in spite of the benefits which limited liability gave. That does not only apply to the shareholders; it also applies to the directors, and I would be quite happy that this concept of personally limited liability should apply to the auditors, too. In fact, if I might let the Committee into a secret, I had even thought of formulating a new clause to that effect, only, of course, it might be trying your patience, Sir Stephen, a little too much. I had not realised quite the amount of emphasis that my hon. Friends would place on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worked my way to the new clause in a form of words which finds itself in new clause 19, because I want the non-executive directors to be as effective as possible. Many people with whom I have discussed the role of the non-executive director have said that all too often they are inevitably ineffective at board meetings because they do not have access to the data that the executive directors have. That is why, in my clause, I said that the data and estimates which were to be produced by the firm must be circulated to all directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, when I was introducing it, I said that I thought all the directors would benefit from having access to this information because sometimes—and perhaps it is the smaller public companies where one needs to be particularly concerned—the original entrepreneur has developed his own way of running the business and although, as the business has grown, it has become a public company, perhaps inevitably he still runs things his
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
own way and the board members are often departmental heads whom he has taught and promoted and who do not have access to the facts about the company which, as directors, they need, even in an executive capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, the Minister, will know from his own experience the problems that arise in companies where one man keeps all too much in his own hands and the board is not really an effective body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, large public company or small public company, executive directors or non-executive directors, I believe that something on the lines of my new clause would be beneficial. But I realise that it would only apply in a relatively small percentage of companies because the vast majority of companies have to do something on these lines all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is evidently still under the misapprehension that I am suggesting that auditors should produce these forecasts or that they should endorse these forecasts. I tried to make it clear that I did not want auditors to be involved in either of those things. I would not mind if some other body of independent people advised companies which were not taking the trouble to prepare accurate forward estimates of what they ought to do, but I do not see who better can be found than the auditors, unless possibly non-executive directors who know themselves to be very well supported and trusted by the shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If companies are not doing what I have suggested they should do in new clause 19 then they certainly ought to be, and if there are companies that are not doing it, it is a matter of concern to all of us because those companies will inevitably be running very serious risks, not only with their capital but with the careers of their employees as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the time, in dealing with company law, we come back to the problem of the supervisory element which has decayed in British companies not so badly as it has decayed in companies overseas, and I am sure that this is a matter with which the House, and in particular the Ministers Department, has to do something. They must make the directors more fully aware of their responsibilities and strengthen the supervisory element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the Committee stage, I have tried a number of different suggestions, and have not made as much pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
gress as I should like. I thought that possibly we might have done something to encourage companies to instal an inflation accounting system. My hon. Friend has resisted that. I felt that it would be advisable if the largest companies appointed audit committees, but my hon. Friend has not quite seen his way to support me on that, at any rate not yet, but I live in hope and do not intend to give up. Then I felt that if we could see to it that public companies had at least three non-executive directors, they might perform the supervisory functions. This morning, I suggested that companies might be called upon by their auditors to have professional routines for forecasting their profitability, and so on, but my hon. Friend is not quite seized of that, either.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to new clause 38. May I say that I had the pleasure of having lunch with the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page).

	<div class='title'>Qualifications of Company Secretary</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>"It shall be the duty of the directors of a public company, when appointing the secretary of the company, not to appoint anyone other than a person who in the opinion of the directors has adequate knowledge and experience of the duties and responsibilities of a company secretary and who either

	<ol>

	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>

	<p>ought to be, but what we look for our Ministers to do is to come forward with the right solutions, and this is something which I shall continue to press him to do.</p>

	<p>I do not know, in view of all that has been said, whether it is worth forcing the Committee to go to the trouble of voting. I feel rather disposed to do so, because I believe that this is right, and that hon. Members should declare themselves on it. If I force them to do that, Sir Stephen, perhaps it will require them to give the matter further thought, and so on balance I wish to press my amendment.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a very happy lunch together, Sir Stephen, and I hope I am still capable of moving the clause. It concerns the qualifications of company secretaries. It seeks to ensure that the secretary of a public company—I stress "public company"; I am not dealing here with private companies—is qualified to do the job of secretary. It is as simple as that. It seeks to do so by imposing a duty upon the directors, when they are making an appointment of a secretary, to see that in their opinion the secretary is properly qualified, and that he has certain qualifications which are listed in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reference to paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), one of the qualifications being that he is a member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, I ought to admit at once that I am an honorary Fellow of that Institute, and that the clause may perhaps seem special pleading on behalf of that institute. After all, it is one of the qualifications for the job to be a member of an institute which teaches persons to be proper secretaries of companies. I am sure that that is necessary. There have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
many abuses of company law and, if I may so put it, company morality or standards over the past few years, some of which have shocked the public and which could have been avoided, perhaps, by having a professional man as secretary who would have properly advised his directors, not only on what the law might be but on the standards of practice in company administration. I do not say that all these abuses would have been avoided had the secretary been a professional man qualified to carry on the job, but I believe that some might have been avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the best way to ensure to the public that too many of these abuses do not occur is to have the key man in a company—and I call the secretary the key man—not only with a knowledge of administration, company law and company procedure, but who has professional standards on which he can judge his own conduct and the advice which he gives to his directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the company's auditors have to be qualified. They have to have the full qualification of auditors—but strangely enough, they are the only officers of a company who require qualifications, and although they may spot malpractices, they can only spot them after the event. They are not there to prevent malpractices. They are there to identify them when they have happened, if they have happened. They approach the matter from an outsider's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary is the man at the centre, who looks at the company administration from the insider's point of view, and accordingly advises his directors. Again, directors by law do not need to be qualified. It may be that some of them are very well qualified both in company practice, commercial law and other professional matters. But they have great responsibilities—to the shareholders, to the employees, to the company's customers, to the suppliers and to the community at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In carrying out those responsibilities, they ought to be properly advised from the administrative point of view by a qualified company secretary. He should be the guardian of the law and even of the moral conscience of the company. The directors rely, I think typically, on the secretary to ensure that the company is fulfilling its responsibilities under the law, and he holds
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
that unique position at the heart of the business. The secretary is an officer of the company. He is potentially liable under the Companies Acts to criminal proceedings in a wide variety of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where duties are imposed on the officers, frequently the secretary is the officer who is actually responsible for seeing that those duties are carried out. If they are not carried out, he may be criminally responsible. A high proportion of the statutory obligations relate particularly to the administration of companies and to matters for which the secretary is responsible. A survey was made recently of the duties of the secretary, when it was found that in more than 90 specific instances failure by a secretary to perform his job properly could result in criminal penalties. Indeed, as the Committee will know, section 177 of the Companies Act 1948 requires every company to have a secretary. But it stops there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act does not say that a company must have a secretary who is qualified to do the job. He can be a secretary who is wholly unqualified. Any unqualified or inexperienced person may be appointed as secretary, even of a public listed company in which the public is invited to invest. If it is thought that my argument is perhaps aimed more at public listed companies than at public companies in general, I admit that that is so, but perhaps it is invidious to make that distinction between public listed companies and other public companies. Therefore in new clause 38 I have merely expressed it as applying to public companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend tell us whether the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators has assessed the number of secretaries of public companies in the United Kingdom at the present time who are not qualified? I should have supposed that the overwhelming majority had the sort of qualifications that my right hon. Friend advocates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures but, as my hon. Friend says, the majority certainly are qualified. It is perhaps the minority at which this clause would be aimed, and a minority which may defeat the public confidence in public companies that there is always a man there who is qualified to advise the directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, if this new clause were accepted, it would make no great difference
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
to many public companies. Many public companies ensure that they have either a professional man outside secretarial professionalism, such as a lawyer or an accountant, as secretary. Others make sure that they have one who is trained as a secretary and who knows about all the necessary administration and company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary represents the company to the outside world. He is the person to whom people make complaints. He is the person to whom people write about the company. He is the person from whom they expect to receive a reply on behalf of the company, and the person who, to outsiders, must represent the shareholders and the employees of the company—not only the directors—the person whom the public would regard as the one to whom they make their inquiries about the company. He is the person responsible for complying with the law and seeing that the company complies with the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I glanced over a number of the responsibilities of a secretary. His responsibilities and knowledge of administration and Company law start even before the company is formed. If he happens to be named in the articles of association, immediately he has certain responsibilities towards the public through the registrar of companies. He has responsibilities with regard to the fixing of the registered office, with regard to the letter headings of the company and the seal. He has responsibilities with regard to the commencement of business of the company. Indeed, many of those responsibilities have been increased by the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary has responsibilities to see that the company has the statutory books, the accounting records, the books of share certificates, the minute books and the registers—which seem to increase in number each time we pass a new Companies Bill—the register of members, the register of charges, the register of directors' interests, the register of voting interests, the register of debentures and so on. The secretary has to know about all the requirements of those registers and be able to keep them accurately. He has responsibilities relating to the capital of the company and the securities, the increase of capital, and seeing that the proper notices are served and filed with the registrar. He has responsibilities in connection with the auditors and their proper appointment—,if they require to
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
be dismissed, the proper notice that has to be given—and the disclosures which have to be made to the auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary is responsible for the annual returns, for the documents that have to be annexed to those annual returns, for dealing with the subsidiaries' annual returns and so on. He is responsible on the transfer of shares and debentures, though he may have the registrars of the company behind him to deal with the actual details of that. He is responsible for advising directors on bonus issues and so on. He has to ensure that the statutory meeting is held, and is held properly, and notices are given, and he is responsible for the procedure at meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to the winding up of a company, the secretary's responsibilities are innumerable, and I shall not endeavour to list them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that brief outline of what the secretary of a company has to do, how he has to advise his directors and his responsibility in seeing that the company does the right thing, it can be seen that it is essential—not just desirable, but essential—that the company secretary should know his job. He can know his job only if he is qualified, if he has been taught to do it, and has learnt to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last thing I should wish to do by my new clause is to push out of office any of the very qualified secretaries at present employed and appointed—qualified by their experience. But this is the sort of thing that has arisen every time that over the years we have wished to make some statutory provision on the qualification of professional men. We have always recognised that qualifications are gained by experience as well as by examinations, and on every occasion—doctors, dentists, accountants and so on—whenever statutory provisions have been brought in saying, that the person holding himself out as an accountant, dentist or whatever it may be shall have qualifications, we have said that those who are already practising, who already have qualifications, shall be accepted. I have endeavoured to do that in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to be appointed as secretary, notwithstanding that he lacks the official qualifications, but his paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) says that the individual must have been a secretary for five years. Should not paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) be adjusted to include assistant secretary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction which I have endeavoured to make between paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>). Paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) relates to the secretary or the assistant secretary of the company concerned. If he is already the secretary of the company, or if he is an assistant secretary with considerable responsibilities, the directors will know that man and be able to form their judgement. Paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) applies to those who have not been employed by the company making the appointment but who had their qualifications elsewhere. Therefore, I have restricted that to someone who has actually been employed as a secretary elsewhere. It is a minor point. I am only too happy to reconsider any drafting question of that sort, but I thought it a reasonable distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle at the bottom of the clause is that the directors should satisfy themselves. It is not a penal clause on a company that the secretary must be qualified or otherwise there is a criminal offence. The right thing is to place a duty on the directors to make them realise that they owe a duty to the public to see that the man at the centre of the business, the man who advises them, the man on whom the public rely, is properly qualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the secretarial companies of firms of accountants are no longer, by their professional rules, able to provide these services now, but there are companies which provide secretarial services. My reading of the clause is that it would for the future prevent companies that provide these secretarial services from doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be a personal prejudice of mine, but I would prefer to see an individual responsible as secretary. I quite appreciate that there are certain companies which, as corporate bodies, are secretaries, but one of the objects of this clause is to find an individual who is qualified and responsible. I fear that if companies take on the job there are cases in which an unqualified clerk is given the job to look
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
after the secretarial work of a company. Perhaps it might be a side-swipe of this clause that that could be prevented in future. I would not mind if it was, and I say at once that I do not personally like companies as such being secretaries of public companies. I think that we should have an individual who can be made responsible and who is seen to be qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the clause, even if it needs a little tidying up in drafting, because, to some extent, the suggestions in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) to (
	<i>e</i>) have been deeply considered over the years. There is nothing new in the principle proposed in the clause, and it has been thoroughly digested by the professions over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses similar to this have appeared before. Clauses much more fierce, if I may say so, have appeared in previous Bills or amendments to previous Bills. There has been a Private Member's Bill debated in the House on the subject. This present new clause is a distillation of all those clauses and debates, and I believe that it is probably now in the best form. It is the best form in imposing on the directors the duty to see that the secretary is properly qualified, and there are the bodies there to provide the qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer now to paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) to (
	<i>e</i>), starting at the bottom and working upwards. Of course, those legally qualified would be qualified as secretaries—those who have been called or admitted as barrister, solicitor or, in Scotland, advocate. Accountants, too, would qualify. Then there is in paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), a member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. Finally, in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>), are the two which I have already explained, the secretary who has been secretary of the company or his responsible assistant, and the secretary who has been secretary of another company for a period of five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Parliament have by law imposed on companies the duty to have a secretary. We have imposed an enormous number of duties on that secretary. It is true that as a rule we have said that officers of the company shall be responsible, but, in fact—I say this very definitely—when we talk about officers of the company it is the secretary who is the man who is really responsible for 99 per cent. of the duties which, if not carried out, may result in criminal prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having imposed those duties on a per-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
son who by statute has to be appointed, the House has a duty to see that the person so appointed is properly qualified. It is a duty to the public, so that the public can rely on the fact that there is a qualified man at the centre advising the directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When looking at these matters, I am inclined to look at them from a trade union background. I notice that paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>), (
	<i>d</i>) and (
	<i>e</i>) speak of a secretary being a member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators or the Institute of Chartered Accountants, or being a barrister, solicitor or advocate. Does this not condone the principle of the closed shop? Does it give support to that principle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that skilled jobs need skilled personnel, and certainly it is the function of professional bodies such as those mentioned to see that the personnel are skilled enough to do a particular job. I support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the same applies to trade unions. It is their function to see that certain things are done. If the person concerned—in this case, the secretary of a company—is a member of an appropriate professional or trade union body able to do that kind of work, he should be employed in that capacity. It is a principle which is well worth supporting that the secretary of a company should be someone who belongs to an appropriate professional or trade union body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State For Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) on the powerful way in which he has developed his reasons for bringing this clause forward for consideration. I agree with nearly every word of the new clause. In particular, I fully agree with the opening lines. Certainly, the directors of a company would be failing in their duty if they were to appoint as secretary a person who did not in their opinion have adequate knowledge and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree also that paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) to (
	<i>e</i>) of the clause contain a useful selection of suitable qualifications for those seeking appointment as company secretary, including that of membership of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, an institute which has deservedly earned great respect in the commercial and industrial world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, however, a number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
difficulties with the clause which make it unsuitable for incorporation into the law. I shall mention two of the defects which seem particularly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first difficulty arises because the list in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) to (
	<i>e</i>), as I have said, gives only a selection of suitable qualifications. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Mr. Roberts) may be interested to know that it is not a comprehensive list of those who might be entitled to consideration on the principle that he mentioned. I do not know why, for example, members of the Association of Certified Accountants have been omitted from paragraph (
	<i>d</i>), for they are qualified to be auditors of companies, as my right hon. Friend knows, under section 161 of the Companies Act 1948. Nor do I know why a person with appropriate experience who is a member of the Institute of Bankers should not be eligible to be the secretary of a banking company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, the list excludes people who may have appropriate experience in other companies, perhaps overseas, whether in the EEC—and we have to think ahead about considerations of that kind—or a Commonwealth country with a legal system similar to our own but who are not members of one of the listed institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second defect in the clause is that it applies only at the time of appointment. I think my right hon. Friend will want to consider this. There is nothing in this clause to require a company to remove a company secretary who has been expelled or struck off by his professional institution. Since we are considering legislation to regulate the appointment of company secretaries, it seems strange that the proposal we have before us has not made provision for the need to remove from office people who have shown themselves by unacceptable behaviour to be unsuitable to continue in that office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that that second defect could easily be put right for secretaries who qualified under paras (
	<i>c</i>) (
	<i>d</i>) or (
	<i>e</i>) of the clause. But the first difficulty, over the list of qualifications, is less easy to solve. The Department of Trade has given considerable thought to this question, and has concluded that there are only two solutions which would be workable in day-to-day terms in a satisfactory legislative manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One solution would be to have a restricted list, along the lines of paragraphs (
	<i>c</i>) (
	<i>d</i>) and (
	<i>e</i>) of this clause, perhaps with the power to add to it by statutory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
instrument. This would, of course, discriminate against those with adequate experience but no requisite formal qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I at this stage refer to a point that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), who referred to the situation of companies acting as secretaries. The new clause, I am advised, would not prevent companies from so acting, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) thought, since it applies to persons, and under paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) a company which had acted as a secretary for three out of the preceding five years would be qualified. So it would appear that companies of this kind of sufficient standing under the definition would have a right in perpetuity so to continue as company secretaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I put the word "new" or "future" somewhere in my comment. I appreciate that companies which qualify under paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) would be entitled to carry on in perpetuity, but I am talking about the company of Barclays Bank that may be started in a year's time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, my hon. Friend is right in saying that there would be difficulty in that case, and the point that I have just been making would not apply in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second solution to the main problem of the listing question, which would be much less satisfactory, would be to have a statutory list of approved persons who are eligible for appointment as secretary of a public company. This would have the great disadvantage that the Government would become involved in assessing the competence of individuals, and this would entail an increase in the numbers of civil servants—a prospect which would not appeal to my right hon. Friend—at a time when we are trying to reduce public sector manpower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that the experience of my Department in approving individual auditors under the now defunct section 161(1)(
	<i>b</i>) of the Companies Act 1948 would not encourage us to repeat the process with company secretaries. It is not really a proper function of government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the list of prescribed individuals to which the Minister has referred include not only professional bodies which have been spoken of the whole time but also institutions which also organise people to do company secretarial work, such as ASTMS, APEX and other such trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would depend upon the nature of the list that was prepared, but certainly consideration would have to be given to including a great number of persons, including certain kinds of organisation, within that definition. It would be a very difficult function for a Government Department to say "Aye" or "No" to the inclusion of applicants. It is not really a suitable way for a Government Department to operate in this field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for constantly jumping to my feet, Sir Stephen—it is becoming intolerable—but my right hon. Friend might want to say that, for example, a member of ASTMS should be able to be secretary of a company owned by a trade union, or in the trade union field, but perhaps not in another field. I use the trade unions merely as an example. That is a different kind of discrimination between different types of secretary which somebody might want to apply, and it is not covered here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that point, and I think that we ought not to get drawn into the great range of difficulties which would apply in determining the kind of organisations and the list that might be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our preliminary comments have already indicated that there would be a number of severe difficulties, and I have to deal with some of the difficulties of the new clause before coming to the principle behind it. We agree that the position of secretary to a public company is a responsible one, and that those who hold such positions should have suitable knowledge, experience and competence, and that undeniably—especially, in my view—it will usually be of benefit if the company secretary is a member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, or is a qualified accountant, a solicitor or a barrister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has made those points strongly. But the key question is whether there is such a clear need, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
the public interest, to control those holding the position of company secretary that we should introduce legislation which, as I have shown, would have to be prepared very carefully and in a form which would either be unfair on particular individuals or almost inevitably involve an elaborate bureaucratic mechanism for assessing competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not persuaded that a sufficient case has been made to introduce this new requirement, having regard to the severe drawbacks and difficulties I have described. We consider that the appointment of a company secretary should remain, as it is now, a matter for the proper and serious concern of the directors of a public company. In that light, I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that there are good reasons for asking him to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the force of a great deal that was said by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) in support of his new clause. The Minister has detailed some of the disadvantages of the drafting, but the right hon. Gentleman himself anticipated that, as do all of us who are denied the valuable use of the parliamentary draftsmen. We all have reservations about our capacity to draft with complete accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman recognised that in his remarks, and, in the main, if I may say so with respect, what the Minister did was to deal with the detail and hardly at all with the principle, although in his peroration he said that he was so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the ultimate responsibility for the appointment of a competent secretary rests with the directors. They carry the can if the appointment is a negligent one, if bad decisions arise through that gentleman's recklessness or incompetence. But that does not deal with the principle lying behind the right hon. Gentleman's new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, too, that the Opposition would not wish to embark upon something comparable to the old section 161 of the Companies Act. I remember that that created many difficulties during my period as a Minister, and we decided that that form of appointment of auditor would have to go. But having said that, and having accepted many of the Minister's criticisms, I cannot believe that it is right to assume, simply because he has opposed the new clause in the terms he employed, that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
task of putting this new clause in order and thus meeting the right hon. Gentleman's objectives is beyond the grasp of the Department or the parliamentary draftsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we all agree that the second solution put forward by the Minister is one that we do not want to embark upon, I cannot see that it is beyond the wit of man to provide a list of requirements which in no way would impugn or discriminate against those with experience but without the sort of qualifications set out in the last part of the new clause. I do not see why the Minister should say that those two things are mutually exclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what I hope the Minister will do, if he speaks again, is to indicate that he will look afresh at the points made by the right hon. Gentleman and others and that he will say that between now and Report he hopes that the matter may receive further investigation by the Department. A cogent case has been made. This is far less restrictive than some of the similar provisions which, if I recall aright, the right hon. Gentleman moved in the past and which I found myself, when a Minister, unable to accept because they were restrictive. I believe that they were related to the qualification of being a member of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. It does not matter a great deal, but I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will himself agree that this is a far wider provision than those he introduced in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I consider that the Government ought to look afresh at the matter, because the argument is different from that which we have debated before. If the Government adopt a set posture here and say that they cannot budge and the right hon. Gentleman decides to challenge that view, we shall support him on the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The limited liability company in this country has been the basis of our national wealth, but for a number of years it has been declining in efficiency, in profitability, in competitive power, in its ability to sustain the necessary exports on which this country has to live and to resist the pressure of imports from other free enterprise societies which order their industrial affairs better than ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to recommend to my hon. Friends and to the Department a series of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
ways in which I believe, by minor reforms of legislation, we could improve the position. In his new clause 38 my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), from his broad knowledge of what happens in limited liability companies, has also made a specific recommendation. Once again, the Ministers are resisting it. I think they have a duty to free enterprise in this country to take the opportunity while this Bill is before the House to show that they do understand and care about the duties of directors and the ways in which company efficiency could be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only in 1948, as I recall, that it was made necessary for auditors to be qualified. I suppose that in the years leading up to the 1948 Act many hon. Members and company reform campaigners tried to get an amendment that auditors should be qualified people, and, no doubt, they were resisted in precisely the same sort of terms as my right hon. Friend's new clause is being resisted this afternoon. But, looking back, I do not think that very many people would now say that it was wrong to insist that auditors should be qualified. Similarly, if the Companies Act in 1980 was a landmark in respect of company secretaries, I do not believe that many people looking back would say that that decision was wrong, either. But what would be wrong would be to let this Bill now go through simply as it stands without any further addition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After what my right hon. Friend has said, I think that the Ministers should respond. We have an interesting opportunity on Report further to improve this Bill. Let them use the Christmas Recess to find ways in which they can perfect the wording and bring something forward to the House, which, I believe, would be accepted without any controversy and would be regarded very widely, by people who know what happens in limited liability companies, as a decided improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary accepted the principle, and indeed accepted the first few lines of new clause 38, and that his criticisms were aimed at the details of the list which I have inserted of those who could prima facie be treated as qualified as secretaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the fact that the clause provides, first, that the directors must be satisfied that the person whom they
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
are appointing
	<br><blockquote><p>"has adequate knowledge and experience of the duties and responsibilities of a company secretary"</p></blockquote>
and then goes on to say "and who has" one or other of the five qualifications I have listed. There is nothing new in listing qualifications in this way for an officer of a company. We have had it in the case of auditors and it is thoroughly accepted now. What was not accepted was that somehow we should get involved in trying to approve individuals because of an alteration in the law in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in any way suggesting that there should be any assessment of the competence of an individual. He would qualify by being a member of one of the institutes or by having the experience that I have set out in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned others who might be included in the list—certified accountants, bankers and so on. I am perhaps a little sad to remember that I argued on other occasions to enlarge the list of auditors by including some of these bodies and was shot down in flames in the Standing Committee on a previous Companies Bill. I really do not mind if it is enlarged by those qualified people, certified accountants, international accountants and those who have taken bankers' examinations. If we want to restrict the latter to banking companies, for example, well and good. It only means a few more words in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the qualification of three years out of five as secretary of a "public company", I do not mind leaving out the word "public" and adopting a phrase used elsewhere in the Government amendments that we have considered. Let it be any company whether it is a company registered under the 1948 Act "or not", since I understand that means also companies overseas. If it is thought that it is right to allow those who have experience overseas to qualify, well and good. It means just a small amendment to my list, and no difference in the principle of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which was mentioned by my hon. Friend is one to which, I assure him, I have given considerable thought. I realise that we are here dealing only with the moment of appointment and that those who are appointed may well become disqualified. It would have required a most elaborate clause to try to deal with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
that point. I should have thought that if a man becomes disqualified by being expelled from his institute for misconduct, or if he becomes insane or something of that sort, the directors in their wisdom would replace him as secretary, and if the directors did not the general meeting of the company would do it pretty quickly, and someone would call a general meeting to do it. I do not think it possible to list the occasions on which the secretary should be sacked for some misconduct. It surely follows that his appointment would be terminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend went on to say that the only solutions were a list or assessing the individual. I cut out the idea of assessing the individual altogether, and I shall deal with the question of a list. I endeavoured to relieve the Department of some difficulty by setting out the list and leaving it at that, but I know that in the case of auditors the Department or the Secretary of State has the power to enlarge the list. If he wishes to take that power, I have no objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the clause, let it be said that the Secretary of State has power to include others. That might be wise. We have seen both mergers of institutes and the splitting of institutes on occasion, and two institutes of a split institute may well be qualified to train secretaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that my hon. Friend accepts the principle. I ask him and the Committee to accept the clause as it stands and let it be amended at a later stage. If it does not get into the Bill now, it probably never will. I am sure that the Government would not wish it on record that they do not want company secretaries to be qualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening, but would my right hon. Friend help the Committee by explaining what sanction there would be if the directors of a company did not comply with the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the failure of a director in his duty. We have had that on several occasions, not only in the Bill itself but in amendments and new clauses which have been put to the Committee, stating that such-and-such is the duty of directors, and that duty can be enforced, of course, by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make it particularly easy for mischievous persons to take action against a secretary whom they think is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
qualified. If the secretary is not qualified and the directors have done wrong in their duty in appointing the wrong person, let us have careful consideration of that; it is bound to be careful consideration if it is for the company to enforce that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite sufficient to make it a duty of the directors to make the appointment, and the sanction is action by the company as a whole to enforce the duty of the directors. I say again that I hope that the Government will not allow it to be put on record, by advising the Committee to reject the new clause, that they are not in favour of company secretaries being properly qualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to look at a number of points which have been raised by right hon. and hon. Members in the course of this interesting debate. Despite the general wish to have regard to the principle of the clause, the discussion has brought out some of the practical difficulties which arise which members of the Committee have to bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), who must have considered this matter during his long tenure of office at the Department, made clear that he would have no desire for something like section 161 and those requirements about the appointment of auditors. I certainly agree with him in that respect. The hon. Gentleman went on to say that he thought that it would be possible to list the requirements on those who would be eligible for appointment in accordance with the principles of a clause of this kind, not impugning, he said, those of experience but without qualifications. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman must in his ministerial experience have realised that that in itself is not easy. Otherwise, no doubt, he would himself have brought forward a proposal of this kind at a certain stage.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the practical difficulties, of course. That is what I have been worrying over for a long time, and I hope that I have overcome them in the new clause. In defence of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), as he leads in the defence for me, may I say that we have piled on to the secretary more and more duties under the present Bill. Each Companies Bill that becomes an Act piles more and more duties—and duties of knowledge—on to the secretary. What I propose becomes more and more necessary. Whatever may have happened on the last three occasions when the practical difficulties overcame the desirability, the desirability has now overcome the practical difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is undeniably true, but I am sure my right hon. Friend would accept that experience is a most important factor in dealing with those problems, more perhaps on occasions than a particular qualification. My right hon. Friend knows very well that some very bright young men or women may acquire the qualification and yet take some time and experience to build up a knowledge of life before they begin to operate fully and properly in a competent way.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was so baffled by the tortuous reasoning of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central in trying to justify his position this afternoon and the tremendous change which has taken place since 20 November 1978 that I had really lost track of who was speaking. I now realise that the interventions were upon my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), carrying on his campaign, mentioned the duty of free enterprise in this country to see how improvements could be made in company law. He went on to mention what I must admit was a very powerful point, that the introduction of the qualification of auditors took place only in 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) acknowledged
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
in the course of his speech that the moment of appointment was extremely important, but he went on to accept that disqualification was also of great importance. I want to ask my right hon. Friend to consider this very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend conceded that by unsuitable conduct or by insanity, and so on, a person could be disqualified. But I point out to him that if the membership of an institution is to be one of the qualifications, surely it is necessary to consider the circumstances in which loss of membership of that institution, for example on grounds of misconduct, would necessarily mean that that disqualification would also apply in the wider field of eligibility for appointment to the post of secretary of a public company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point very strongly because the hon. Member for Hackney, Central, who we know to have a keen mind in these matters, acknowledged this afternoon that there is this difficulty about the approved list, or other requirements which would follow. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby has acknowledged that there is a difficulty about the question of disqualification and how this qualification and this sense of eligibility would have to be withdrawn. I suggest to hon. Members that this is not an easy matter, and the evidence of the ministerial record of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central, shows that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. Friend to consider very carefully those two major practical difficulties that I have put to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with my hon. Friend in the way he is struggling to find some argument against this clause. I am not convinced by the arguments which he has been briefed to put before the Committee, and I propose to continue with this clause and put it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the course of this debate, which has been a very valuable one because it has shown that opinions change, the point has been made that this clause goes wider than earlier proposals. I appreciate very much the great sincerity and knowledge with which my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby has not only prepared this draft clause but has spoken very powerfully in its support. I also ac-
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
knowledge that in the course of the debate a great number of points have been made on both sides of the Committee which show that there is an earnest desire that the matter should be given further consideration. I believe also that the Committee will understand that there are practical difficulties which have emerged during the course of this debate. I would like to make it clear to the Committee that I am prepared to examine the new clause to see whether a workable clause can be prepared that meets all these practical objections which have been deployed and which I have had to ask right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to consider. I undertake that very careful consideration will be given to see whether a practical and workable clause can be prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to put it as strongly as to say that we might be able to accept this clause with the addition of further qualifications which deal with the points that I have made and which take account of the need for provision for the acceptance of persons who are of adequate knowledge and experience. Perhaps we could think about the person of adequate knowledge and experience who might be unfairly or harshly treated by a clause of this kind which is not carefully enough prepared, the extra consideration which needs to be given to the kind of list which has to be prepared and the further consideration which has to be given about the means of disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee will bear with me and allow the Government to consider these questions carefully, I certainly undertake to do everything possible to prepare a clause which meets all the points raised, and which will make a contribution along the lines which I concede that many members of the Committee wish. On the basis of that undertaking, I hope that my right hon. Friend will recognise that we wish to make progress in that direction, and I hope he will withdraw his new clause on the basis of that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking, as I understand it, is that the Minister is prepared to consider the matter with sympathy and to consider whether it is appropriate to introduce a clause of this kind on Report.

Nothing can stop them from coming back later to amend it—indeed, if we pass the new clause now, the Government have a direct incentive to come back and say "We have accepted the principle. This is a better clause than the one which was imported into the Bill." That is the course that the Opposition would prefer.

In saying that I intend to press the issue to a Division, I am not being antagonistic to the Government in any way. I am presenting them with a model on which, if they see fit, they can draw amendments. But if the new clause remained out of the Bill, I could not be satisfied. On those conditions, I accept my hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, a holding company and its subsidiaries have to be treated as separate entities in law. That was set up emphatically by Mr Justice Pennycuick in Charter-bridge Corporation 
	<i>V.</i> Lloyds Bank Limited in 1970. But although the law may provide for the raising of the veil of incorporation in specific cases, for example, a deliberate holding out, or in the obligation to present group accounts, the principle that I have stated is the right one, or the one that prevails at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was confirmed in a recent case where a public company, Esperanza Limited, sought to stand aside when a subsidiary, Caleb Brett & Son Ltd., had an award of $2.1 million in damages made against it. What then happened was that Esperanza immediately took steps to wind up its own subsidiary, and Mr. Justice Parker, in granting a stay of execution regarding the damages award—and that aspect of the matter I make no comment upon because it is 
	<i>sub judice</i>—observed that it was a holding company's right in law to stand aside from its subsidiary, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may well be that it is an attitude which is unfortunate."</p></blockquote>
That is why the Opposition seek to put the matter right to some extent through the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a change in the law is overdue. I hasten to add that, on reflection, my right hon. and learned Friend and I feel
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
that although our new clause would be of some help in that regard, it is probably too restrictive. What we are anxious to do is to consider, with the Government and with the Committee today, the principal that I have adumbrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that our new clause may be too restrictive because it occurs only on a winding up. It is based on the criteria set out in section 332 of the Companies Act 1948, which are wider than is very often assumed. However, we feel that it may still be too restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I ought to refer specifically to section 332 (1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"If in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the court, on the application of the official receiver, or the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper so to do, declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in manner aforesaid shall be "personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the court may direct."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) enables the court, where it makes such declaration, to make such further directions as will give effect to the declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of fraudulent trading is, as I have said, wider than that which perhaps the laymen assumes, and while there must be enough evidence to justify a finding of fraud, that is, actual dishonesty, it was held in the case in re. William C. Leitch Brothers Limited in 1932 that, if a company continues to carry on business and incur debts when there is to the knowledge of the directors no reasonable prospect of the creditors being paid, it is in general a proper inference that the company is carrying on business with intent to defraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another case, in re. Maidstone Builders Ltd. in 1971 in which it was stated that to be a party to carrying on the business of the company in a fraudulent manner required a positive step and mere failure on the part of the secretary and financial adviser to draw attention of the directors to the fact that the company was insolvent and the consequences of continuing in business in these circumstances did not make him civilly or criminally liable under section 332.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reflection, we feel that by restricting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
the provisions in the way that we have to a winding up, we have probably not taken full account of the representations that have been made in this respect to the Department by the accountancy bodies. We have a great deal of sympathy with their proposal. What they suggest is that parent companies should be liable unless they publicly register their intention not to be so liable. I believe that to be an interesting concept, and it is one which if the Government find that they are not able to accept our new clause, we may be able to explore in later debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should we be talking about this reform at this time? In practice, small firms are frequently stimulated to undertake business with a subsidiary because the small firm in question becomes perhaps unduly influenced by the connection of that subsidiary with a prestigious and substantial parent company. When the truth dawns, when the subsidiary gets into trouble, and the parent company then disclaims any responsibility for what has happened, the small business man may in fact, as often happens, be deeply shocked, embarrassed and prejudiced as a result of that discovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While of course it may not be good morality for holding companies to adopt that attitude, the present law permits them to regard it as good business. The current commercial practice seems to be that moral obligations in this respect may be regarded as secondary or, in some cases, hardly of any consequence at all. An article appeared in the 
	<i>Sunday Times</i> last weekend, after we had put down our own new clause. It was argued there that increased diversification may have altered the pattern of commercial judgments in this regard. It asked, why worry about upsetting a subsidiary supplier in the ice-cream business if the rest of the group deals in oil futures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sort of argument is cogent. It is built upon experience. It is regrettably common practice for a parent company to adopt the sort of scheme of which I have spoken. It is common practice, too, to create a group image, and if that is considered to be advantageous to the parent company, why should not liability, or responsibility, flow from that towards the creditors of the subsidiary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples where subsidiaries are faced with something close to this representation but probably not in fact constituting misrepresentation in law,
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
when the parent company is seen to be involved to some extent on the face of it with the subsidiary, and the latter assumes that the parent company will in fact indemnify the subsidiary. Skilful use of this advice can certainly cause others to rely on the existence of the parent company as having strength and resources which will come to the aid of the subsidiary in due course if need arises. Often in this sort of situation the subsidiary itself is without resources, or without resources of any consequence. It is subsidised by the parent company, and is viable only as long as the subsidies are forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I ought to clothe the argument with some instances which were cited in the same interesting report in the 
	<i>Sunday Times</i> only this week. It was reported that in the early 1970s a company, Hensher (Furniture Trades) Ltd, appointed a receiver to a major subsidiary of that company George Hensher Ltd. The purpose of the appointment of the receiver was to recover about £100,000 which had been lent to the subsidiary on a debenture by the parent company, but certainly the parent company had no intention at all of paying off trade creditors who were, and I believe still are, owed something of the order of £400,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second instance is in the Esperanza case, to which I have already referred. There is a public company which found that one of its subsidiaries, Caleb Brett & Son Ltd, was awarded $2.1 million in damages. Immediately the judgment was given, or very soon afterwards, the holding company sought to wind up its subsidiary. It was claimed that the holding company had a duty to the shareholders, to avoid the company's incurring the obligation of paying the money that was due unless there were overriding commercial reasons so to do. So much for morality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regrettably, I have to concede, this practice affecting private enterprise companies is occasionally employed in the public sector, too. I suppose the Government applaud that because they would argue that companies within the public sector, under the aegis of the National Enterprise Board, ought to employ the same principles of commercial judgment and practice as those employed in the private sector. Although there was a case affecting British Tanners, a company run under the aegis of the National Enterprise Board, a subsidiary of the NEB and the Barrow Hepburn group which is a publicly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
quoted company, which traded for barely a year when the receiver was put in and on that occasion trade creditors were owed about £6 million, the NEB, as I understand it, was not prepared to stand behind British Tanners, and the creditors were the worse off for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to acknowledge that the Under-Secretary of State for Industry has said that the NEB would not allow British Leyland subsidiaries to be abandoned if British Leyland were to get into difficulties, and I think that is a very important undertaking on the part of the Department of Industry which we applaud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But here we have a situation which calls for review. The Government may say that this is a matter which is being considered by the Cork committee, dealing with a very considerable revision of the laws relating to insolvency. Although perhaps our own new clause might have been injured by that particular defence, my remarks go more widely than the clause that I have drafted with my right hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing that this is not simply a situation which has to be dealt with within the compass of the review relating to insolvency law. This is a matter which we ought to grasp now. The review will take a long time to complete, and certainly it will be some considerable time before the Government are in a position to introduce legislation to give it effect. Yet this is a continuing abuse. It is one which ought to be tackled now, and I think that the proposals that have been advanced by the accountants, coupled perhaps with what we are suggesting here, give a useful avenue of remedying that abuse which the Government really ought to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with other hon. Members of the Committee who, in introducing their amendments, have said that they may not have got the ideal form of words. I accept that readily. But once again we are dealing with a principle here, and I hope that the Government will be as forthcoming as they ultimately were in the last debate—it took a long time but, nevertheless, they were ultimately forthcoming and prepared to accept that amendment. I hope that they will be as responsive to what I have said in support of this new clause as they were on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
pursuance of that appetite, still un-assuaged, I endorse much of what he said about new clause 41.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it is not sufficient to say that fraudulent intent must be proved before a holding company can be made responsible for the debts of its subsidiaries. Indeed, to many members of the public, including me, it came as something of a surprise to find that this was not automatically the case; I had supposed that the holding company would be responsible for the burdens and the benefits of its subsidiary, howsoever caused. The contract with employees in such circumstances nearly always insists on their being willing to move from company to company, or to take instructions from one company or another at the whim of the holding company. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, the growing practice of establishing corporate identification strategies across a whole range of companies manifestly implies to the public at large that they are part of the same family, that they are interdependent and that those who enter into business arrangements with the one may expect to benefit from its involvement with the others. This is equally so whether the company is trading overseas or in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, as the Minister and the Under-Secretary know from earlier conversations, one of the anxieties which I am sure that the man in the street has when he contemplates existing British company law is not so much some of the more arcane issues which we have discussed in considering the Bill, but the simply observed element in business life where groups of directors can operate a company from given premises, can go bust and can start again the next day in the same premises, under a different name, and with many of the same people involved. This Seems to the man in the street to be a simple wangle which our law should not permit and which makes a mockery of our attempts to introduce legislation which is fair and equitable and which, as has been said repeatedly in this debate, seeks to control not the 99 good and honest sheep but the one sheep in wolf's clothing which is to be found in any community or any activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade will have the rather wider issues in mind, because I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
have no doubt that whichever way we come to vote, if we vote in due course, the views I have expressed are shared by many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take issue with what my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) has said on a number of points. I really wonder whether he has examined the content of the clause. It suggests that if company A owns no more than one-fifth of company B, and fraud turns out to have been perpetrated in the case of company B, company A should be involved. This is something we should think carefully about before accepting. Not only does it go against the principle of companies being separate bodies, but it could operate very unfairly indeed against, for example, directors, shareholders or employees in a company that was deemed to be a holding company by this one-fifth rule, but which had nothing to do with the fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what we should really be looking at. We should be trying to say—and I think this is really behind the thoughts of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis)—that we should pursue and punish at law those who are responsible for fraud. In one of the cases he mentioned, it seemed to me that the other company that had been part of the fraud might well be responsible for it, and penalties already exist. But in the case that he mentioned of a furniture company, if I followed it correctly, it seemed to me that there was a perfectly good remedy in the hands of somebody who had been defrauded or suffered loss at the hands of the subsidiary company. They had the perfectly good remedy of winding up the subsidiary company and then pursuing the holding company for the money it was owed by the subsidiary company and, if the holding company failed to pay, having the holding company wound up. There are perfectly good procedures for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham referred to a growing practice of dealing with companies in groups, and here I should like to warn against politicians pronouncing on fashions many years too late. It seems to me the fashion in companies now is to decentralise and to give individual subsidiary companies much greater control over their own affairs and

for them to be run as separate entities which, indeed, at law they are and also increasingly in terms of management. Frankly, some of the comments I have heard today are comments by people who have not been in contact with companies as they are run at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the accountants suggest—the hon. Gentleman may be aware of this but it is worth repetition—is that if a holding company seeks to distance itself from the subsidiary, in some appropriate form notification of such distancing—that it is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the subsidiary—could be given. I think that that would probably answer the point that the hon. Gentleman is making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that he has given proper consideration to the representations that have been made by the accountancy bodies. They seem to me to be very cogent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one possibility, but I have to say that in the practice I have been engaged in where people deal with companies, they understand the distinction between one limited company, and another and it is endemic in some transactions that the question of the holding company becoming involved, for example in service contracts or leases by subsidiary companies, is an important part of the negotiations. It seems to me that people understand the difference in ordinary negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My conclusion is that this clause could have far-reaching consequences. There are remedies against people who commit fraud, whether they are in the company where the fraud takes place or in a holding company or anywhere else, and I am not convinced of the need for a clause along these lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words in support of my hon. Friend's efforts to give protection to the weak and poor subsidiaries which are compelled to wind up. From reports that I have read in the financial press, it appears that there are a considerable number of business failures due to bad debts, particularly in this period, and these debts in the main are owed by subsidiaries of quite big parent companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The businesses which fail, of course, are generally small ones, small and weak because they are left to themselves.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
Reference has been made, and I should like to underline it, to the National Enterprise Board which, in some cases, has been responsible for the collapse of companies, or not standing behind com panies that have collapsed. British Tanners were mentioned, and the effect this had upon a number of small leather companies. But a number of companies—British Leyland has been mentioned—are concerned lest they are left holding the baby by the NEB. This leads us to say that there should be—and the NEB is only an example—here should be a moral and legal obligation upon the parent company to be responsible for its subsidiaries, in the same way as a parent is responsible for the children to whom they have given birth. They are responsible for them. They cannot turn their backs upon the activities or the damage done by their children and say "Well really, it is no concern of mine," when as parents they are responsible for their existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some subsidiaries build their businesses upon the well-known name of their parent companies. In fact, they would not obtain the business that they do if it had not been that they were able to use, by association, the names of their parent companies, which refuse in times of financial difficulty to accept any responsibility for the debts incurred. This is a loophole for those who want to engage in dishonest dealing and fraud as is referred to in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a matter of fact, does the hon. Member accept that he might not be right in saying that all subsidiaries develop their trade on the name of the group? I believe that they do not. One of the reasons that they do not is that, by using the name of the holding company or the group they could, as a matter of law, involve the holding company in liability for debts in the ordinary course of business. What he says is not the case, certainly in my experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in all cases, and certainly what the holding companies do not do is make it perfectly clear that particular subsidiaries are not operating under their cloak or under their control and are companies for which they have no responsibility at all. It ought to be made clear that these subsidiaries are not in any way financially tied to or controlled by the holding company. That is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
made clear. That is one of the troubles. The strong holding company gets the benefits of the subsidiaries which are working in their interests, and on the basis of that fact alone it should also enjoy the losses. It should take part in the losses which the subsidiaries have to face in the event of having to be wound up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, read with interest Patience Wheatcroft's article in the 
	<i>Sunday Times,</i> headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Firms that go bust to cut their losses."</p></blockquote>
The article outlines a problem which exists, and there have been a number of instances which have pointed to the fact that the present law is not satisfactory in certain areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a fair amount of sympathy with the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), who said that people dealing with a company that has limited liability should not be encouraged to think that they are dealing with anybody but that company. If one got the idea that there was no obligation on oneself to take care, that would be dangerous. If I enter into a contract with company A, I must satisfy myself that company A can carry it out. Just saying, "Oh well, if it doesn't, I needn't take any care, because company A is part of a bigger group and I am bound to be all right", is not the type of thinking that we should encourage. I therefore have quite a lot of sympathy with the point of view which my hon. Friend has expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) points to a problem, and his hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Mr. Roberts) and my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) share that view. It is a fact that section 332 of the 1948 Act applies to a holding company, where the holding company is considered by the court to have been knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of its subsidiary with the intent to defraud its creditors. The new clause would extend the power of the court to deal with a case where there was a fraud, but where the holding company was not a part to the fraud, or not knowingly a party to the fraud. This would apply where a holding company had proceeded in a reckless manner in dealing with the affairs of its subsidiary, not necessarily in the knowledge that creditors would as a result of its actions be defrauded. There have been recommenda-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
tions before that Section 332 Should be extended generally to cover the case where reckless behaviour results in defrauding of creditors: the Jenkins Committee in 1962 made such a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman pointed to the fact that the consultative committee of the accountancy bodies had come up with an ingenious suggestion that parent companies should register where they did not, in fact, accept obligation for the debts of their subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the law as it stands is not wholly satisfactory and that section 332 needs amending. But the hon. Gentleman anticipated my reply. I believe that he set up the Cork committee. I believe that the Cork committee is doing valuable work on the whole area of bankruptcy, liquidiation, insolvency and so on. We expect to receive its report next year, and there is great anxiety to see it and to deal with the entire subject in full fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think, however, that it is a subject which lends itself to piecemeal reform, and we put new clause 31 firmly in the bracket of piecemeal reform. We point to a major flaw in the proposal which was touched on by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North. The situation is worse than he suggested, because subsection (2) of the new clause contains a definition of a holding company which is extremely wide. It includes a company which holds one-fifth or more of the company's shares—which is a very small amount—where that other company holds any shares in the company being wound up. That is a huge extension of the definition of holding company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This could have the effect of applying the clause to a remote company but not to an intermediate company which directly held less than 20 per cent. of the shares of the company in liquidation. So it is not just 20 per cent. It is a much wider definition than that. We think that it is a fatally wide definition of a holding company and, in its own right, should disqualify this clause from reaching the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman predicted my reply to a degree, namely, that we would pray in aid of the Cork committee. I hope I have reassured him that the Government also read the newspapers and that they recognise the problem which he seeks to correct. But we do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
believe that new clause 41 is the right way to go about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the observations of the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) who, unlike his hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), recognised that there is a problem in practice here. It goes beyond legal theorising. It is a problem which the Minister himself conceded was recognised by Jenkins. It has been recognised over a period. We have sought to recognise it in the new clause, however imperfectly drafted it may be, and which I may tell the hon. Gentleman was put down before the publication of the article in the 
	<i>Sunday Times.</i> It is reinforced by the evidence that was disclosed in that article. I think that the hon. Member for Dorset, North is not living in the real world if he suggests, as he clearly does, that there is no problem here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Gentleman was really saying was that people engaging in business with subsidiary companies ought to employ such devices as are available to them to ensure that the subsidiary company will be viable and will pay its debts as and when they fall due. But instance after instance has been brought forward to establish that things do not really work like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a situation where representations are made by the subsidiary, very close sometimes perhaps to misrepresentation, but not going beyond the frontier of the law. General impressions are conveyed that the subsidiary is really part of the empire and the customer need have no fear. But when the crunch comes, all those assurances or quasi-assurances come to nothing, and the cold truth dawns on the customer when the sub-subsidiary says "We have no assets" and the holding company says "We are very sympathetic and all that, but we cannot assist the customer in question".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, as I have indicated, section 332 may be construed more widely than the layman's impression of it—that was part of what I said; it is the gravamen of the Minister's response—there is still a very considerable burden resting upon a creditor in these circumstances. He has to establish that there is actual dishonesty. That is not a Very easy burden of proof to fulfil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accepted that the CCAB had come forward with an ingenious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
suggestion. His response to that suggestion is not that it is out of order, not that it is impractical, but that we ought to await the report of the Cork committee. But the Cork committee, on his own admission, will not report until 1980, and well into 1980 as I understand it. What assurances can the Minister possibly give that there will be legislation following the Cork committee within a reasonable period of time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very difficult and complex area of the law. It is bound to be involved with what is going on within the EEC. It is bound to require a great deal of consultation. With all the good will in the world that the Minister is capable of mustering, I doubt very much whether this Parliament will actually see legislation with the recommendations of the Cork committee. So this abuse goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seek to shelter behind the report of the Cork committee. I am very sympathetic about that. I think I occasionally spoke about it and, while I am making this remark, I will go on longer so that the Minister can look it up or get someone to look up what I said about that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But while piecemeal reform on the whole is something that I understand the Government would not want to contemplate, where there is a clear abuse being practised, where a remedy ought to be made available—and I think that the argument in favour of that is overwhelming—I think that, notwithstanding the Government's general reticence, they ought to say "We are content this time to deal with the matter". After all, it is small business men, and the Government repeatedly proclaim their identification with the feelings of small business, and we on the Opposition side do the same. Everyone is in favour of small business. But when it comes to a situation like this, the small business man goes on suffering, and the holding company gets away with it. That ought not to be permitted. Where there is a record of abuse clearly identified evidentially—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman feel that a holding company ought to be made liable in any event because it is a holding company, or does he feel that a holding company ought to be liable, or perhaps the people in the holding company ought to be liable, where they have been parties to the abuse?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
If it is the second that he is saying, if he looks at section 332(1) of the 1948 Act—and I did say that I thought there were remedies against fraud, and we are talking about fraud—he will see that it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors … the court … may … declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in manner aforesaid …"</p></blockquote>
will be personally liable. There is a remedy if it can be shown that people in the holding company are involved in the fraud now; there is a remedy against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, if there were a clear and specific holding out initially, there would be no problem. The problem really arises in relation to section 332 that, as a plaintiff, one has to go rather far. Actual dishonesty has to be shown, and that is not an easy burden of proof to fulfil. It is too heavy a burden in the sort of cases that we have been considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the accountancy bodies have said, and I agree with this, is that the holding company should be made liable unless it has, at the inception of the matter, registered its intention to distance itself from the liabilities of the subsidiary. That is a perfectly feasible proposition. It does not impose too heavy a burden on the holding company. It would enable a customer seeking to do business with the subsidiary to satisfy himself what the position was and, if he failed to do that, the burden of responsibility would be on his shoulders. That is perfectly all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, at present, apart from not doing business with a subsidiary at all, there is no real, practical way in which the customer can be given the assurances that he ought to obtain. I feel that the present law operates in some instances, and I think there are many of them beyond those which have been cited by Patience Wheat-croft. I do not have the correspondence before me now, but I recall that there were instances of this that came to my attention—I cannot recall whether it was a constituency case or whether it was a case when I was involved in the Ministry in about 1974—where very clear impressions were conveyed that a subsidiary company was protected under the umbrella of the holding company, quite beyond those that have been suggested by Patience Wheat-croft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it is a matter which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
incapable of remedy now. I accept that our own drafting is imperfect, and I can see problems about the way in which we have defined the holding company here, but I should like the Government to say on this occasion that they will consider the matter between now and Report and come forward with an amendment, otherwise I shall have to adopt the same stratagem as the right hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
I think it would be right to begin my remarks by paying tribute to the work done by Mr. Peter Large, whose high reputation in work for the disabled is so fully deserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed amendment to the Companies Act seeks to provide that, in the case of companies prescribed by the Secretary of State, directors' reports must include information on company policies relating to the employment, training and promotion of disabled people and also information about the company's compliance with the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944, including their quota scheme obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is similar in its basic concept to that provided by section 79 of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, which amends the Companies Act 1967 in accordance with recommendations of the Robens committee so as to provide that certain company reports must include prescribed information about measures taken by a company for securing the health, safety and welfare at work of employees and for protecting others against risks arising out of the activities at work of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is in line with developments associated with companies issuing reports on both financial and social progress during a year. Some companies are now considering issuing company reports covering not only their financial activities but also their work for local communities, their anti-pollution efforts, their contribution to the general standard of living of the communities in which they operate and their policies towards their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is in line also with suggestion in the Green Paper, "The Future of Company Reports." The Association of Disabled Professionals warmly welcomed the suggestion that companies should publish information on their policies towards the employment of disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies with good records in employing disabled people are often those in which a director or senior manager has a special knowledge of or close interest in disability. Many other companies would happily and profitably employ disabled people if the matter were brought to their attention. The requirement for a written company policy on this in company reports would ensure that many other companies started considering the possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
A written statement of policy towards disabled people published in company reports would ensure that there was uniform and consistent action at all levels in a company. It would help to ensure that the problem of employing a disabled person or of retaining a disabled employee is given the careful consideration which it deserves, and which is necessary if disabled people are to be profitably employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further advantage of having a written policy published in company reports is that non-disabled employees would then be given a clear guide as to what a company would do in the event of their becoming disabled themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in companies in which little or nothing is done in relation to disabled people, the fact that a written statement of policy is due to be published in the annual report would help to ensure that the obligations of these companies towards disabled people are the subject of senior management interest at least once a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, the publication in company reports of company policy towards disabled people would greatly enhance employment opportunities for disabled people without imposing any new onerous requirements on companies. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will be disposed to support this new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of the discussions in the Committee have been about very legalistic and technical matters, but this is of human interest and concerns the disabled finding better opportunities for work. I have considerable sympathy with its intention, but there are a number of considerations, none of which relates to company law, which I would ask members of the Committee to consider before coming to a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend and the draftsman of the new clause on having produced a clear and effective proposal. I shall not be pointing to any technical defects there. But it may be helpful to the Committee to know that, following the Green Paper on the future of company reports, published in 1977, when companies responded to that proposal they pointed out that they were frequently unable to meet the required
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
quota of disabled employees as laid down in the Disabled Persons Employment Act 1944 because there were not enough registered disabled people applying for work. In part, I believe that that is due to a certain reluctance among the disabled to register and perhaps classify themselves as a separate category of employee with lower expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a number of reasons, including the decline in the number of registered disabled people, the Manpower Services Commission is undertaking a review of the quota system—I think this is very important—and in May this year it published a discussion document entitled "The Quota Scheme for the Employment of Disabled People." This document raised the basic questions whether statutory employment protection for disabled people was still necessary, and, if so, what form it should take in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of that important review will not be available until next year, and the Committee may feel that it would be preferable to await the outcome of that review, both on the wider question of the possible amendment of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944 and on the specific proposal for companies with regard to disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 48 the Government have taken a general power to alter or add to the directors' report. I give the Committee the strong assurance that if it is generally agreed as a result of the Manpower Services Commission study and the report due next year that companies should be required to publish information about disabled employees, and that this information should be included in the directors' report, the Government will be prepared to use their new power for this purpose. So the Government would be in a position to respond immediately should this be recommended by the Commission which is reviewing the subject in detail and sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
This is not easy of implementation in cases where, as the Minister pointed out, there are not enough applications for work from disabled people, for example, for firms to complete their quota under the 1944 Act. There are other aspects of this delicate matter which need careful handling. I think, therefore, that it would be better if I did not press the clause to a vote. But may I ask the Minister whether, at a later stage, when the matters have been studied, he would be prepared to receive a deputation from people concerned with the bodies which look after the interests of disabled people, so that the way in which the matter might best be tackled by Parliament could be considered further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an amendment to section 165 of the 1948 Act. That section deals with the cases in which inspectors are appointed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, one of the grounds for appointment is circumstances suggesting that the business is being, or has been, conducted in a manner oppressive to any part of its members. This reflects section 210 of the 1948 Act, which permits the court to grant relief in such cases of oppression. Clause 47, added to the Bill in another place, repeals section 210 and provides instead—and I believe this will be welcomed by the Committee—for wider powers in cases where members' interests have been unfairly prejudiced. It is necessary to bring section 165 into line with new clause 47 and, that is what the amendments do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the veteran of the two Committee stages Sir Stephen, I claim from my hon. Friend the privilege of thanking you, the only other veteran of those two Committee stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a pleasure to serve on both Committee stages. The speed with which you have kept us moving when we might have lagged has been a most notable feature of both. On behalf of every hon. Member present, I thank you very much for the way in which you have chaired our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I thank the officials, the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reporters who have served the Committee so well, and the officials of the Department who have taken us through a huge quantity of new clauses, fed us with the right answers at the right time, and generally ensured that Ministers were able to do the job given to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by thanking you, once again, Sir Stephen, for all you have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in thanking you, Sir Stephen, for the care, consideration and courtesy which you have shown to all of us, for the speed with which you have moved, save on one occasion when it was far too rapid. I also join the Minister in thanking the officials who have noted all our talk over the course of the last few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
I should also like to thank my hon. Friends, some of whom have now obtained an academic interest in company law which was beyond their wildest dreams but a few weeks ago. I should like, too, to thank the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Le Marchant) for his indefatigable and unprecedented efforts as Whip for both sides of the Committee. He was throughout very helpful to me in what was a difficult position, in that our own Whip had ceased to be a Whip after the time that he was appointed to be a member of the Committee, which made life rather difficult for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the two Ministers for the way in which they have dealt with a Very complicated Bill. Debating points have been made, but never have they failed to be charming and courteous. It is an example to any Minister who wants to get his Bill not to cause unnecessary animus to the Opposition. If I may say so, the opposition in this case has not only been on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I say to the officials within the Department, notwithstanding some criticism that I had to make this morning—because I was a little annoyed in that particular context—that I really love them after all, and I love them one and all. They have had a very onerous task to perform in undertaking the Bill in the way that it has ultimately emerged. Their tasks are not yet complete, any more than the tasks of those of us who are still critical of the Bill are complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank you once again. I wish you on this occasion—perhaps I may say—a very happy holiday, and a merry Christmas to one and all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most appreciative of the kind words that have been said on both sides. I can honestly say that this is the nicest Committee over which I have ever presided, largely because of the impeccable conduct of the leaders on both sides of the Committee. There has hardly been any rancour at all. One cannot imagine either of the hon. Gentlemen being rude to each other. I cannot imagine either of them saying that he will not cast his pearls before swine rather than saying that he will not cast his pearls before those who are incapable of appreciating them. They have such a nice veneer. Nevertheless, they make their points extremely forcibly and extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very grateful to the Committee for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
the way in which it has conducted itself, and I look forward to the Companies Bill 1981, when we may resume our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse fully the remarks which have been directed to the Minister's advisers. I have tried to decipher their writing, and I could not. On the other hand, I could not decipher the Minister's writing, either. They have done a marvellous job in assisting the Minister in the conduct of his duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful, as always, to the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reporters for recording our words for the benefit of posterity. We are thankful to the police who keep guard on our proceedings. Although they occasion-
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
ally make mistakes and let people in while a Division is being held, we shall not hold that against them. In the main, they have done remarkably well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should add a word of congratulation to our Clerk, who does a very difficult job extremely well and keeps me in order, as I do my best to keep the hon. Members in order.
