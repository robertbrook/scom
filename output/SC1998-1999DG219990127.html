	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Open-Ended Investment Companies (Investment Companies with Variable Capital) (Fees) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998, No. 3087).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<b>The Chairman</b>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Companies (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998, No. 3088).</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being in Committee with you, Mr. Malins. I offer you many congratulations on being in the Chair. You used to play rugby for Richmond. That was regarded in Wales as a very posh club, but I recall that it was full of brutes. However, I have no doubt that you will be very fair as the Chairman—much fairer than the props who played for Richmond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main effect of the Companies (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 is to increase the fees for microfiche products, including the basic search of company records. Fees for a number of labour-intensive services are also being increased in order to reflect their costs properly. The aim is to prevent Companies House from going into deficit in the next couple of years. The other main change is the introduction of a fee of £10 for the registration of a charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my explanation of the changes, I do not propose to refer to each amendment made to the regulations. Instead, I will concentrate on the main categories only. Those cover the bulk of the extra revenue expected as a result of the increases. I will obviously be happy to respond to any questions that hon. Members have on individual items in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will first say a few words on the background to the regulations. Companies House has been an executive agency since 1988, and a trading fund since 1991. As a trading fund, Companies House must recover the costs of providing its services from fees. It must also aim to achieve a net return of 6 per cent. on its assets, taking one year with another. Within that overall framework, Companies House must avoid, as far as possible, cross-subsidy between its various activities. Each major product and service category has to be broadly self-financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies House also has to finance its future development programme, especially the costs of investing in new information technology, from fees and charges.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I visited Companies House recently and found its project to be most impressive and the service to industry will be improved no end. Investment in staff training, marketing and publicity has to be funded from revenue. Those costs must be charged and spread across the full range of Companies House products and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies House is currently undertaking significant outlay for major modification of its systems and services to allow easier electronic access for registration of documents and for information provision. Electronic handling of information is the way of the future, consistent with the Government's modernisation ambitions. It will progressively take over from microfiche, which after 25 years, is starting to look old fashioned and inflexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1996, there was a general reduction in Companies House fees. That was made possible by the agency's success in significantly reducing its costs. None the less, it was necessary at that time to -increase the price of the microfiche search while reducing charges for other services. That was because the cost of running a microfiche service is substantial and substantially fixed. Demand for microfiche is dropping as customers find better ways of accessing information. Therefore, the unit costs of microfiche rise. My predecessor, Phillip Oppenheim, warned of further increases to come, because of the continuing decline in demand for microfiche. In the event, it has proved possible to hold off the increases for longer than was expected in 1996, despite the drop in demand since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the 1996 fees regulations, the volume of microfiche searches has declined by a quarter, from 2.1 million in 1995–96 to 1.6 million in 1997–98. Demand is expected to decrease by a further 20 per cent, in the current year and by another 40 per cent, in the next couple of years. Companies House has succeeded in reducing the overall costs of its documentation registration activities. None the less, an increase in the fee for a basic microfiche search cannot be delayed any longer. The cost of a microfiche search is already £5 compared with the current fee of £3.50. A loss is being made on that particular range of products and it is proposed to increase the fee to £5. I should forewarn hon. Members that, on present trends, further increases in prices for microfiche services may be necessary in the coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may console themselves with the recognition that we are talking of the last years of a product that has served its purpose well, and continues to do so for some needs, but which is being overhauled by more modem, accessible and rapid alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes for microfiche will be offset by growing reliance on computerised information by Companies House customers. Increased demand there will lead to lower prices for accessible, high quality data in electronic format. Similarly, the filing of documents by electronic means, which Companies House began in October, will, over time, also contribute to lower costs and less work for companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main change is the introduction of a £10 fee for charge registration. Previously, the cost of that service has been included in the fee for registration of a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
company's annual return. However, fewer than half of all companies have a charge registered, and only 10 per cent, of companies register a charge in any one year. That has, therefore, represented a significant cross-subsidy in favour of a minority of companies. I am sure that hon. Members would agree that that is not desirable and that now is the time to recognise that and to make the appropriate adjustments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Removal of the element of charge registration from the annual return fee allows the fee to be kept at its present level of £15. No changes are proposed to the fees for any of the incorporation services. The costs are exceptionally low compared with those levied in most continental European jurisdictions. Nor is Companies House seeking increases for any of the electronic or bulk services for which fees have customarily been set administratively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate for me to stress to hon. Members that we are dealing with those fees and charges established by regulations under section 708(1) of the Companies Act 1985. Companies House makes extensive use of section 708(5) for the setting of charges for its newer electronic services. It also does so for certain bespoke services, such as the provision of bulk information, by means of image or data tapes, to its major commercial customers. The flexibility of section 708(5) is necessary for pricing newer products the development cost and take up of which may be uncertain or variable. None the less, Companies House brings the same concepts of cost recovery and avoidance of excessive return, or cross-subsidy, to those other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are increases to some minor, but labour intensive, services, which are identified in the regulations, where costs have risen or were previously underestimated. One example is the provision of certified copies of documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now deal with open-ended investment companies. The regulations that enable bodies to be incorporated in that form have come into force since the previous companies fees regulations were approved. The services provided for those investment vehicles by Companies House are, in the main, equivalent to those provided for companies. They use the same systems and procedures. The present fees regulations introduce equivalent fees for similar services to those that Companies House provides for companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my explanation of the reasons for the fees charges has been helpful. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down, perhaps he could help the Committee. I tabled a parliamentary question to him for answer yesterday asking what additional revenue Companies House would receive in the next financial year. He said that he would reply in due course. Will he also describe the user profile of the people who use the microfiche services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ho wells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the first question easily. About £2 million of extra revenue will be generated. That will cover the additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the profile of users, I saw for myself during my visit to Companies House that there was a huge range of users but that relatively small categories of users banded together as clearly identifiable groups. We have already spoken to some of those groups about the proposed increase in charges from £3.50 to £5. They vary greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I used Companies House when I worked in the coal industry. We would go there to discover who owned small holes in the ground, which were registered as coal companies. We received a superb service in the early days of microfiche—that is how old I am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Users also include agents who might deal with hundreds of companies. They might conduct systematic and regular searches on behalf of some of our leading firms. Such firms might have all sorts of dealings with supplier companies and might also, want to update and reconnoitre their own entries. The range of users is wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies House is an important part of the knowledge-driven economy about which we have all talked for so long. It provides vital intelligence to representatives of all sorts of sectors of industry, whether they are small firms or large corporations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. I will not try to ingratiate myself with you as much as the Minister did; nevertheless, my relationship with you goes back rather longer than the Minister's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the regulations, Conservative Members are concerned because we are talking about a 40 per cent, increase for particular user groups. As the Minister just confirmed, we are talking about an additional £2 million burden on business. Before the regulations are passed, I hope that the Minister will explain a little more some of the points that I want to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one reads the Companies House annual report for 1997–98 and the accounts, which were published last July, it comes as a bit of a surprise to discover the extent of the problem with the microfiche, to which the Minister referred, and that there will be no corresponding reduction in other charges. The accounts look especially healthy. There is no suggestion in them that there will have to be an increase in fees and charges in the coming year. As the Minister said, the last time that the fees and charges were reviewed was in 1996 under the previous Government, when there was an overall reduction in them and, therefore, in the burden on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, Companies House exceeded its financial targets last year. The reduction that was achieved in the real costs of processing documents was 6 per cent, compared with a target of 3 per cent. The average rate of return was 8 per cent, compared with a target of 6 per cent. A target of 6 per cent, would have resulted in the payment of a dividend of about £1 million directly into the Exchequer. A 7 per cent, cut in the real unit costs of registration occurred in 1994–95, a 5 per cent, cut in 1995–96 and a 5.5 per cent, cut in 1996–97. That is a tremendous record, and I do not believe that any Committee member would wish to take away from Companies House the credit for that achievement. Its management and staff have done better than even demanding Ministers asked of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The target for the current year was a unit cost reduction on document registration of some 3 per cent, and a rate of return of 6 per cent, of average net assets employed. Will the Minister say how Companies House is proceeding against that target at this stage in the financial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
year? The targets are modest in comparison with previous achievements. Nothing in the annual report suggests that they can be achieved only be obtaining an increased income from fees and charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the £2 million that the Minister referred to as the total additional burden in the context, we should bear in mind that the total income from fees and charges for Companies House last year was some £32.5 million. That is a significant percentage increase in income. The Companies House report shows that it is able to charge the Department of Trade and Industry for the costs of administration and collection of late filing penalties. The incidence of such penalties has increased significantly, from just over £15 million in 1996–97 to £18 million last year. Recent 
	<i>Sunday Express</i> reports stated that a number of prominent companies have been fined for late filing, including the Progress Trust, of which Baroness Jay of Paddington is the treasurer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More seriously, incorporated companies that never file accounts get away scot free, without having to pay a penalty. A company that falls into that category is 3C Ltd., of which Mr. Draper was a director. It was set up to promote the books and works of fiction of the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Apparently, the company has been struck of the register having never filed accounts. The company traded under the protection of incorporation, but now nobody will every be able to discover its income and expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may be straying slightly from the regulations, which are narrow. I am sure that he will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Malins, and I note the sensitivity of the subject for some Labour Members. There are other examples, but I shall not take advantage of your position by referring to them. Scope exists, however, for the imposition of additional penalties in such cases, in which accounts are never filed and the company involved is dissolved by order of Companies House or, ultimately, by order of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The imposition of penalties for late filing has substantially increased, and the revenue produced now exceeds £18 million. That may give Companies House more scope to increase the amount that it receives for administration from the Department of Trade and Industry. The sum is quite modest, considering the effort involved. It must be a labour intensive activity, dealing with companies whose directors have failed to file accounts on time. It appears that there has been no increase in the costs involved in that respect. Although the level of activity has increased, there has not been the 40 per cent, increase in costs relating to dealing with microfiche inquiries to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are concerned about those additional costs. Many charges will rise by 40 per cent. That will result in an overall increase in revenue to Companies House of some £2 million, yet the latest accounts give little indication that that additional income is needed. If, as the Minister said, it is right that individual
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
services provided by Companies House are not cross-subsidised by others, why are there not to be some corresponding reductions in other fees and charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.51 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister about Companies House's fee charging policy. Have the Government fully thought through the implications of an agency such as Companies House operating in a commercial or semi-commercial way? The Meteorological Office and Ordnance Survey are similar organisations. They provide a public good. We need to know what the weather is going to be like as a matter of general public interest, in the same way that we need access to company data. Companies House, however, is trying to operate commercially at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do those two elements come into conflict? That may happen in a new industry which has recently grown up. The Minister talked briefly about new information industries. I do not know whether he has heard of the information provider industry, which is growing rapidly. One of its leading companies, which employs a couple of hundred workers, is in my constituency. Such companies are probably now bigger employers than those in the coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that has been pointed out to me is that Companies House is trying to do two things at once. It is trying to be a monopoly supplier of information, for which it charges a fee to information provider companies, which then cleverly transform it, through computers and printing, into reports for industry. On the other hand, it is a direct competitor with such companies in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why Companies Hosue should not charge feed to the public to cover its costs—that is perfectly reasonable—and there is no reason why it should not compete. However, trying to do the two things simultaneously creates a potential problem in the marketplace for the new information-based industries. I am not arguing their case in the sense of having an interest. Problems are being created in very new industries where the ground rules are not yet established. Launching an agency such as Companies House on to a commercial route potentially creates problems that may not have been fully thought through. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether the Government have taken mat into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard some interesting points, at least latterly. I was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) use this discussion about charges as a means of battering some of my colleagues. However, they will probably survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that, as a trading fund, Companies House is expected, broadly speaking, to recover the costs of the services that it provides from the fees that it charges. An even spread of increases would mean that some services and products cross-subsidised others. Companies House, in common with other public organisations, is prevented from cross-subsidising in that way by European legislation. It

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
must charge for each significant, measurable group of products or services, whatever that group of products or services cost to produce, and no more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to congratulate Companies House on its record, which represents a significant set of achievements. The microfiche business actually lost money last year. As my predecessor, Phillip Oppenheim, pointed out, despite the profits that might be made in some sections, a time will come when the Government will have to look at the charges being levied for microfiche services. As demand for those services declines, so the unit costs rise. That is a fact that every Government must face. The management at Companies House waited for as long as possible before introducing an increase in charges. I do not think that an increase of £3.50 to £5 represents a hugh burden for companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) asked me about the user profile, and I tried to answer. I have been supplied with a breakdown, which shows that the main microfiche users—10 per cent. of customers—are from the private sector. Use by agents and intermediaries, to whom the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) referred, constitutes 30 per cent, of the business. They use microfiche part of the time, but electronic systems increasingly. The major users, who constitute at least 30 per cent, of customers, use the electronic systems almost entirely. The banks sometimes use microfiche, but use is declining and they too use electronic means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about Companies House competing with private sector information providers is very interesting. It will not doubt surface in the future, not only with regard to Companies House but other companies. The hon. Member for Twickenham talked about the hugh business of weather forecasting. I have no doubt that in the future there will be demands that competition law takes those considerations into account and clarifies them. I should certainly not like any business, whether it is subsidised by the Government or acts by proxy for the Government, to distort competition in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies House fulfils a clear function of being the main registry for companies in this country. That is an enormously important role in information provision, and it must be clearly defined. We are asking Companies House to generate revenue to help pay for the extraordinary service that it offers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the charge that the industry currently pays is fair, and that the increases that we are debating are reasonable. They will not only contribute to the health of Companies House but will contribute directly to the health of our industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for answering some of my questions, but he manifestly failed to answer the point about the consequences of an additional £2 million in revenue for Companies House. In the year ending 31 March 1997, its total revenue was about £35 million, and in the last financial year, the total revenue was just less man £35 million. As a result of the proposed additional fees and charges, the revenue will increase by an extra £2 million. The Minister has not explained why the figure has to be that high and why it cannot be balanced by a reduction in some of the other fees and charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have explained why the other charges cannot be reduced. We cannot cross-subsidise; we are prohibited from doing so. I think that that is clear enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has taken me to task over why we need that additional £2 million. Companies House informs me that, without the proposed increases it would be trading at a deficit, amounting to a loss of £4.5 million over the coming two years, from 1999–2000 to 2000–2001. How would such a deficit be met—are the Government supposed to bail out Companies House? I do not think so. It has a proud record of generating enough revenue to operate as a successful agency. The extra £2 million to be raised will keep it solvent, which is surely what we would expect from such an organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
