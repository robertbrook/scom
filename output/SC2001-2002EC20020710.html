	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Working Conditions for Temporary Workers</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions (Alan Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have replied to Lord Brabazon's letter of 20 June that sought further information on the Committee's behalf. I signed the reply on Monday 8 July, but it may not yet have reached Committee members, so copies are available on the Table. The consultation document is also available. We are consulting for 16 weeks on the European Commission proposal for a directive on agency workers, which was published in March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister almost before he has started, but he will know that the Government have been criticised in the past for putting documents out to consultation just before the summer holidays. Many people who wish to comment are away during August. Can he extend the consultation period to take account of the effective four-week blackout in the middle of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We published the proposals on 1 July and we are allowing 16 weeks for consultation. To a degree, that is governed by the speed at which the Commission works. The period is usually 12 weeks, but we have allowed 16, so we have added four weeks to cover August, when we are all in Tuscany, Blackpool, Bournemouth or wherever. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman that we have tried our best to ensure that there is a proper consultation period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the proposal for a directive was published in March. That followed the breakdown of negotiations between the European-level social partners, who had aimed to agree a framework on working conditions for temporary agency workers. The proposal is still in the early stages of negotiations. It was introduced formally to the Council of Ministers early in June, and working group discussions on it are beginning. The Employment and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament is also discussing the proposal and hopes to produce a report in the autumn, before a vote of the European Parliament in plenary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal applies to temporary workers who work for an agency and are placed with a user organisation under whose supervision they work. The proposal requires that agency workers should not have less favourable basic working and employment conditions than similar workers employed by the user company in which they work. The equal treatment requirement need not apply in certain situations, which I shall deal with later. The directive also includes measures intended to help agency workers to find permanent jobs if that is what they are looking for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Commission's explanatory memorandum on the proposal states that it aims to promote employment growth and that the directive should contribute to the Lisbon targets. These require increased labour market participation by 2010. I have produced a regulatory impact assessment on the proposal, which estimates its likely costs and benefits. It has been difficult to establish the overall labour market effect that it might have, but I would be extremely concerned if the proposals had a negative effect on the demand for agency workers, and therefore on overall employment levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, my Department launched a consultation that seeks views on the likely impact of the proposal in the UK. I hope that it will give us a better idea of how the proposal will affect the UK labour market, and inform our estimates of the costs and benefits to agencies, workers and user organisations. We asked for responses to be given by 18 October, and I shall inform the Committee of the outcome of the consultation and the progress of negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not opposed to the principle of a directive on agency workers. We welcome the Commission's intention to protect agency workers and promote agency work in the European Union. However, it is important that the directive works in practice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The procedure is that the Minister makes a statement. We then have until 11.30 am for questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the directive works in practice in the UK, which has a different agency market and history of agency workers from other EU countries. It is also important that it helps us to deliver full employment. We are concerned that the current proposal will do neither of those. We would like further flexibilities to be introduced to ensure that the proposal promotes employment growth and helps us to meet the Lisbon target of 20 million more jobs by 2010. The proposal allows member states to derogate from it where this has been agreed collectively, where agency workers are employed on permanent contracts, and where their assignments can be accomplished in six weeks or less. We welcome those flexibilities in principle, but they would not necessarily suit the UK labour market in practice. Few agency workers are union members, which makes collective agreement unlikely, and permanent contracts may not suit many agency workers who choose to temp because it offers them greater flexibility than permanent work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support an increase in the length of the six-week period, which would reinforce the idea that agency workers should generally be used in temporary jobs. After about a year to 18 months in the user company, there is a good case for giving agency workers the same conditions as other workers in that company. Where agency workers are in genuinely temporary positions, there may be a danger that an equal treatment requirement would impose administrative burdens that discourage the use of agency workers. We are, of course, considering other ways in which additional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
flexibilities could be introduced to the proposal that protected agency workers without threatening their job opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal lists the basic working and employment conditions to which it applies. One of those conditions is pay. The Government believe that the current proposal cannot apply to pay, as it is subject to the exclusion in article 137(6) of the treaty. When we agreed to the directives on fixed-term and part-time work, we stated in the Council minutes that they could not apply to pay, as their legal bases derived from article 137, and as they were subject to the exclusion in article 137(6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing the Committee's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for short and direct questions asked one at a time. We will then debate the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pick up a point that the Minister made in his opening remarks. My understanding from reading what he said to the European Scrutiny Committee was that the Government did not support the principle of a European directive to achieve the objectives. He told that Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government intends to examine this case further and seek certain clarifications from the Commission. In particular, it is not clear that the objectives in question cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states' action."</p></blockquote>
I came to the debate this morning under the apprehension that the Government were still minded to resist the EU's inclination to deal with the matter by a directive. The Minister appears to have sold the pass between giving the report to the European Scrutiny Committee and today. Will he confirm that the Government have shifted their position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our concerns were set out in my opening statement. We have no problem with the concept that agency workers should be protected. They are already protected in legislation on the minimum wage and working time directive, and we are reviewing other protections that are applied domestically. We have no problems with the proposal's concept related to job opportunities and ensuring that temporary workers are informed about permanent positions in that company. Our problem relates to terms and conditions—as it did when I made my contribution to the European Scrutiny Committee. That is the problem on which the social partners broke down and about which there are legitimate concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the negotiations have correctly been about protecting workers whom employers might be tempted to pay less than their normal staff. Before I became an MP, I worked in the IT world, in which temporary workers were often paid a lot more than permanent staff because they did not have security of tenure or the benefits that other staff received, but had special skills. What negotiations are taking place to protect permanent staff, who might one day find that temporary staff get all the benefits and the extra money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. Even on the stark and crude statistics that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
have to analyse, we can see that in two of the categories of workers in the regulatory impact assessment, temporary workers earn more than permanent ones. Personal services form another category, and those categories account for 17 per cent. of agency workers. There is not a direct relationship between the employee and the company—there is a third party, and people work for an agency that places them with a company—so we are concerned that the directive could have dramatic effects. We could see the situation predicted by my hon. Friend. Of course, the directive would not require companies to pay less, but it would distort the balance of packages that are currently available. That is an important part of our concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that a major employer of agency staff is not the private sector but the Government, particularly in the health service. Many health service employees choose to work as agency workers, not least because they are better paid than if they were on a permanent contract. My question relates to the regulatory impact assessment and, specifically, the Minister's thoughts on the directive's impact on the health service. Given that many agency workers are better paid than permanent staff, does he think that it will have a positive impact on the health service? I ask the question because the Government's interest in the regulations might not be the same as that of agency workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a similar point to that made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman). The personal services category includes nursing, and it is clear that, on average, nurses receive more as agency workers than as permanent staff. However, the directive does not require people to be brought down to an average level; it only brings people up. It would have no effect on employers such as the national health service that pay more to agency workers—unless, crucially, it distorts the agency market. In other words, there would be no effect unless a European directive caused such problems for the supply side that fewer agency jobs were available and fewer agencies operated. In the United Kingdom, some 17,000 of those employment agencies are small and medium enterprises, which is unusual compared with the rest of Europe, where the big five employment agencies cater for a much higher percentage of placements. That is a concern, and when hon. Members have had a chance to read my reply, which has just been circulated, they will see that there is not enough evidence to suggest that this proposal will not have a negative effect on employment opportunities. That is a still an open question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the temporaries whom I employed got fed up working for agencies, so they set up their own companies to employ themselves. Many of them were one-person companies whose only resource was their own services. How will they fit into this overall picture?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had a feeling that the term IR35 would pass my hon. Friend's lips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It never did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend. He asked a good question. Unusually, we have gone out to consultation on a Commission proposal. Many businesses will welcome that, because too often Governments of all persuasions are criticised for consulting on a directive after it has been set in concrete. We are certainly considering the directive's impact on limited company contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister? Does the directive cover just workers from the European Union or does it also cover those from outside the EU? When we speak about not levelling down, will he accept that some agencies have tended to recruit people into the health service and then employed them not as nurses, for which they were qualified, but in care homes where they were paid less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first instance, the directive covers workers working in the EU from wherever they come. Secondly, I accept the hon. Gentleman's concerns. Similar concerns have already been expressed. The proposal could have an impact on job opportunities. I am unaware of the particular details in the health service that he mentions, but certainly in our review of the regulations that apply to agency workers, which have been in existence since 1976, we have found a need to look at how we can protect agency workers from the kind of misuse that he describes. That can be done in domestic legislation; it is not necessarily part of the European directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to my previous question. One of the frustrations of this format is that it is designed to enable Ministers not to answer questions and not to be pulled up with interventions. The Minister seemed to imply that he had never been opposed to this matter being dealt with by European directive and the only question in his mind was about flexibility. However, in his submission to the European Scrutiny Committee he raised the issue of subsidiary. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In particular, it is not clear that the objectives in question cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states' action."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister confirm that the European Scrutiny Committee was correct in interpreting him to be questioning whether this was properly a matter for the EU to deal with by directive rather than something that could be adequately dealt with by member states' national legislation? If the Scrutiny Committee correctly interpreted what he said then, has he now changed his position and what has caused him to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not, at any stage, suggesting that we did not have a concern about subsidiarity. It is always good to question subsidiarity in these matters. Things have moved on from there. I also clearly said that the Government believe that temporary agency workers deserve adequate protection. The Commission is now producing a proposal. The social partners did not break down on the part-time workers directive or on the fixed-term workers directive, but they broke down on this. In those circumstances, it was argued that we should not seek to take the matter forward. The Commission took a different view. The Government will not have anyone misconstrue our position and claim that we are not interested in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
protecting agency workers. We are, which is precisely why we have argued on matters such as the six-week issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony D. Wright
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Yarmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on agency workers from eastern bloc countries such as the Czech Republic? Many students come to work on farms in my constituency, for example, often for a 10 to 16-week period on a temporary contract. Would the directive cover them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not clear whether such workers would be covered by this or by the fixed-term workers directive. If they were placed by an agency, the present directive would cover them. If my hon. Friend is concerned about what is happening in his constituency, he should ring the employment agency's standards inspectorate—the appropriate body for examining complaints.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government—shamefully, in my view—negotiated with the Commission an exclusion for junior doctors from the working time directive. Will this directive cover locum doctors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If locum doctors are placed by an employment agency, they will be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the laws of other European countries on how much time it takes a temporary worker to gain employment protection? In this country it is a year. We are encouraging more temporary work, but some employers intentionally keep their employees in job insecurity and then get rid of them before the year is up. That stops them from having to meet any obligations on working conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complex area. There is a difference between agency workers and fixed-term workers, and when we debated the fixed-time workers directive in connection with the Employment Act 2002—we felt that pay should be covered, but through domestic legislation—we made it clear that it was important to be aware of the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's first question was about when rights to unfair dismissal kick in in the rest of the European Union, but there are day-one rights in this country and in the EU: it is a mixed picture. However, Committee members should not get bogged down on that aspect because this directive focuses specifically on workers whose relationship and contract of employment are governed by an employment agency rather than by the company in which they are placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other member states may apply statutory rights to agency workers. In Ireland, it depends on whether people are employees or self-employed, which adds another level of complexity. We shall be consulting later this month on the question of who is an "employee" and who is a "worker" in this country. Debating that would add considerably to our two and a half hours. We need to focus on agency workers whose relationship is with an employment agency that places them with an employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has expressed the Government's clear view that article 137 prevents the inclusion of pay within the scope of the directive. The Government fudged the issue on the previous two

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
occasions by incorporating pay through domestic legislation, which prevented them from engaging with the Commission. The Trades Union Congress shares the view that pay can be included. Can the Minister give a clear commitment now, on behalf of the Government, that if the Commission persists in maintaining that pay can be included in the scope of the directive under article 137, the British Government will test it by taking the Commission to court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that we fudged the issue. The part-time and fixed-term workers directives did not mention pay. Article 137(6)—the article on which the proposal is based—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of this Article shall not apply to pay, the right of association, the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs."</p></blockquote>
We informed the Commission of our view that it should not cover pay. The hon. Gentleman asked if we would ever legislate domestically to cover pay; we were seized with the argument that, for part-time and fixed-term workers whose relationship is with the employer, it was right to cover pay and pensions directly, not under the directive—as I explained, it is based on article 137—and we did that domestically. We do not have the same view about agency workers. I cannot say now, because we are at the start of a consultative process, that that will never change, but I am not convinced that agency workers are in the same position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not willing to give a categorical answer to that question.

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 7430/02, draft Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on working conditions for temporary workers; and supports the Government's initial approach to negotiations.—[
	<i>Alan Johnson</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.58 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal from the European Union for a directive is a step too far, as the Minister knows. I am disappointed with what he has said this morning; I thought that I was coming here to make it clear that if the Government robustly maintained and defended their position in representations to the European Scrutiny Committee, they would enjoy the unstinting support of the Opposition. However, what has been said so far suggests that the Government, as they have done on many other occasions, have already caved in to the European Commission and have begun the process of constant retreat that is evident in many other directives. The Government initially take a sensible position and defend our national interest, only to find that the Commission and other member states are resolute in pushing forward. The Government then retreat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told the Scrutiny Committee that the issue of subsidiarity had to be dealt with, and that the protection of agency workers could be better dealt with by member states. I concur with that view for many reasons, not least because the UK temporary worker market is a very different scene from that in many other European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having taken that position, however, the Minister has retreated from it in the space of a few weeks. He has conceded that there will be a European directive and has said that the important thing now is to try to "exert influence" in the framing of it. Unfortunately, I have bad news for him: he has no influence to exert. If the Commission gets away with the argument that this matter should properly be dealt with by a European directive, the UK's national interest will be steamrollered in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has no influence because the Government, unwisely, naively or for whatever reason, signed the social chapter. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The social chapter is extremely pertinent to the debate, because we would not be discussing the scope or otherwise of article 137 if the Government had not signed it. We would be debating whether the UK, in its own interest and the interests of protecting British workers, businesses and agencies, wanted to implement domestic legislation that gave the sort of protections that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear about the extent of the problem that needs to be addressed, but we shall explore that in a moment. From the Minister's tone, he seems not to be clear either. No one on the Committee can have concerns about introducing basic protections to ensure that there is not gross abuse in the system, but the EU clearly has an agenda that is not appropriate to the temporary worker situation in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise what would happen if the situation that he has described came about as he has suggested? Agencies would want to base themselves in a particular European Union country, because it would keep their costs as low as possible. They would then employ British staff from abroad, thereby undermining the position of those workers and of British agencies, because they would not be able to compete. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. I am surprised that the Minister muttered "exactly" from a sedentary position, because in evidence to the Scrutiny Committee, he drew attention to the fact that directive 96/71 already deals with the transnational posting of temporary workers. The EU has therefore dealt with what is properly an EU matter. We are talking about whether one size fits all—whether a single set of rules can properly regulate the very different markets for temporary workers in member states. This is not a party political point; I had hoped that the Government recognised the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman define what he means by "basic protections" for workers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean the sort of issues that the Minister has been talking about: employment conditions that ensure that there is not gross abuse. He and I have enjoyed such a debate on a range of issues. I have said many times—most recently on Monday evening, when we debated the then Employment Bill—that the Opposition will support measures that are designed to deal with abuse. An example of such abuse, cited in a debate on that Bill, was of a worker on a fixed-term, six-monthly contract who had been working for the same employer for 20 years. That is an abuse of the process, and we will support the Government in regulating to deal with such abuse. However, the information available does not make it apparent to me or, I believe, to the Minister, that there is any issue of substance to be addressed in relation to agency workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Stephen Hesford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is not a party political point, which I believe it is, why does the hon. Gentleman mention the social chapter? He told the Committee that he is not sure what the problem is in relation to agency working, so what is his point? If he is not sure what the problem is, what concerns him about the Government's initial approach to these questions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not greatly concerned by the Government's initial approach, as set out in the Minister's statement to the European Scrutiny Committee. It warmed my heart, as it set out three things: first, a robust position to challenge, on grounds of subsidiarity, whether agency working was an appropriate issue on which the EU should legislate by directive; secondly, to challenge the legal base of the Commission's involvement; and thirdly, if all else failed, to seek the maximum flexibility for national implementation—in other words, to ensure that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
directive provided as loose a framework as possible to ensure that we could deal with agency working as far as possible in the context of our own national market. I am sure that the Minister would be the first to acknowledge that the UK market is different from the national markets for temporary workers in many other EU countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make some progress on the background to this issue. The UK has more temporary workers than any other EU member state. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong. The UK market is complex, with a hugely diverse range of employees. Highly paid and highly skilled employees, as well as the low paid, engage in temporary work. The Minister may query my comment that the UK has the largest number of temporary workers within the EU. About a third of the UK's employees are temporary workers. Temporary workers make up a higher percentage of the work forces of other countries, but I doubt that any other countries have a higher absolute number. No doubt the Minister's facts and figures will reach him in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of workers, temporary work can provide a route back into full-time permanent employment, if that is what they want. However, it can, and increasingly does, provide an opportunity for flexible forms of work that allow people to design their own work-life balance. A hurdle, which we must overcome in any debate about temporary working, is the mindset that is fixed in a period of high unemployment and employment insecurity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is, but we must recognise that the employment situation in large parts of the country is very different from the situation that I described. Workers can choose to go into temporary work, if they can afford it, reasonably confident that they can take a period out of work, return to the workplace and find a new temporary engagement without much difficulty. That does not apply in some areas, but we must recognise that the phenomenon of deliberate and voluntary temporary work assignments is an increasing part of our employment scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a business point of view, temporary workers provide flexibility to respond to changes in the economy. Crucially, they also provide flexibility to respond to the barrage of Government legislation to create new statutory rights to time off. Every time that the Government create such a statutory right, there must be a corresponding availability of temporary labour to cover that worker's position, if necessary, while he is absent. The Government must recognise that in imposing additional requirements on business to release workers for statutory paternity, adoption or parental leave, or the longer period of maternity leave, they must secure the supply side of the labour market and ensure at least that institutional arrangements do not deter an adequate supply of temporary workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the primary motive for those employing temporary workers is not, as some would wish to paint, to try to secure cheap labour. Temporary workers are not cheap, and a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Recruitment and Employment Confederation survey estimated that 60 per cent. of temporary workers already earn the equivalent of, or more than, their permanent counterparts. The employment of temporary workers is primarily about flexibility, not avoiding labour costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having examined the situation from the point of view of both workers and business, it is worth mentioning the agency sector. As the Minister said, the sector is different in this country from the rest of the European Union, and is made up primarily of small and medium-sized enterprises. Even the four large players have only a small market share, and the sector is currently under great pressure, with turnover and margins both being squeezed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Stephen Hesford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister to say—I am sure that the Committee accepts this—that the directive does not concern pay. I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman is making, because the directive relates to other working conditions that temporary workers may face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had done his homework and read his papers, he would know that that is one of the main problems with which the Government are having to wrestle. The directive includes pay. The Minister tells us that there is no legal base for the inclusion of pay, but having asserted that the Commission is proposing to act illegally, he pointedly refused to promise that, if the Commission introduces the directive, the Government will challenge it in the European Court on the basis of article 137 for a directive that includes pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time that a Minister insisted that the Commission had incorrectly interpreted European law, the Government maintained that position all the way to the steps of the European Court, where they then expensively settled with the Trades Union Congress, represented by one Ms Booth QC. Although I was promised it, I have not yet received information from the Minister's Department about how much that escapade cost the taxpayer. It is helpful of the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) to have reminded me; I shall write to the permanent secretary again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is an example of the European Commission at its worst. There is no evidence of a problem, and the reasons behind its proposed introduction are dogmatic rather than practical. Any such issues could be properly and adequately addressed by national legislation, as the Minister suggested in his contribution to the Scrutiny Committee. The Commission could not achieve a consensus or agreement between the social partners— there you are, Mr. O'Brien, I said it—so it is now imposing what is essentially the trades union position in the form of a directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal basis of the directive is shaky. Although Labour Members do not like it when I mention this, we would not be in this mess and having this discussion if the Government had not decided to adhere to the social chapter. They would have been able to make a unilateral decision about whether pay or other aspects should be included in UK legislation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The Government now have to deal with a problem without any real negotiating strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an ill-thought out proposal in intellectual terms. Why exclude the payment of temp-to-perm fees, but not the payment of fees to agencies placing permanent workers? As I understand the directive, member states would be required to remove any fee impediments to temporary workers moving into permanent work with the same employer. However, if that temporary worker asked an agency to place him in permanent work with another employer, the agency could charge that employer a fee. It is illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government's submission to the Scrutiny Committee is couched in diplomatic language, their position is fairly robust. In summary it is as follows: first, it is not necessary for the EU to legislate at all; secondly, if it is, it is not clear that it needs to be done at European level; thirdly, it is not possible to introduce the directive on the legal base of article 137. If the Government are prepared to stand firm, to argue their corner and to use all avenues open to them, I can assure the Minister that he will have the Opposition's support. Unfortunately, I cannot speak for the minor parties. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where are they?"] Once again the Liberal Democrats are not participating in these discussions. Perhaps they do not think that the interests of British temporary workers, employers and agencies are significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not have a tremendous track record of standing firm in the face of the European Commission and other European partners. We have seen that on environmental directives. I had the pleasure of debating the waste directive with the Minister's colleague just a couple of weeks ago. The Government's initial position and instincts were entirely correct. They took a robust, commonsense view, which we would have been more than happy to support, but unfortunately they did not have any negotiating power. Increasingly the Government's manoeuvres at the Council of Ministers are simply long-term retreats from a sensible starting point to whatever they are forced to accept in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position of Labour Members of the European Parliament? Mr. Stephen Hughes is on record as saying that he wholeheartedly supports this directive. Has the Minister any assurances from other Labour MEPs that they will not wholeheartedly support the directive in the form that is currently being talked about, because it is clear that the Minister has reservations about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has recognised the benefits of temporary work, both for workers and for employers. It will not benefit agency workers to have their terms and pay varied from assignment to assignment. If the Government are not successful in robustly resisting the Commission in imposing this directive, I hope that they will try to negotiate maximum flexibility. First, there is the selection of the comparator, and much of the debate in the early conciliation stage was about that. Should it be a fellow agency worker or should it be a permanent employee in the workplace where the agency worker is placed? There are strong arguments for it being a fellow employee working for the agency that has made the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
placement, not least because I cannot conceive that it will enhance the flexibility of the work force and encourage people to use temporary work as a way of managing people's work-life preferences if, every time they receive an assignment, they find that the rate of pay and conditions under which they are working vary. It is self-evident that people doing temporary work from choice, as opposed to using it as a stepping stone to permanent work, would want to know that under successive assignments they would be employed on the same pay and under the same conditions, conferring a reasonably stable expectation. The only issue for them to consider would be whether they wanted to work that week or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken to many agency nurses and know that they do not work primarily for the higher pay— though agency nurses tend to earn more—but because they have greater control over when and where they work. They choose which department and which hospital they want to work in and they are not subject to posting at will by the employer—the fate of many permanently employed national health service nurses under permanent rotation systems within hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the UK context, the directive is likely to be harmful. The Minister has recognised that, and I acknowledge that he is focused on the issues that need attention. I want to press him on derogation for collective agreements. As he said, it is unlikely to have any practical effect in the UK, but it is a fairly common derogation in EU employment-related directives. It has the simple effect of removing from the argument the weight of member states where collective agreements are the norm, particularly Germany. It therefore removes the German Government from our potential list of allies in doing battle within the Community on this issue. Has the Minister reflected on whether the UK should, as a matter of routine, oppose the collective agreement derogation, which puts us in a different position from several other major EU member states? We often have to fight battles on our own that we could otherwise fight with allies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National collective agreements are still the prevalent form of bargaining in Germany, but 4 million people unemployed is still the prevalent level of unemployment there and no one in this country would want us to move closer to the German system to escape via derogation for collective agreements at that price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulatory impact assessment was thin when it came to identifying benefits from the proposed directive. One claim was that the Exchequer would benefit from the higher tax that agency workers would pay on their higher wages. If that is the best that the Government can provide as a perceived advantage, that is pretty thin gruel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trades unions have welcomed the Commission's draft proposal and they are hostile to most types of atypical work for the obvious self-interest that atypical workers are difficult to unionise. If I were running a trade union, I would be hostile to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
such workers. Employers' organisations and organisations representing employment agencies have been deeply and universally hostile to the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, it is not clear that there is a problem or a case in equity. In some labour markets, workers desire flexibility and it is not obvious that they should be given equal pay for undertaking a more desirable form of employment that they have chosen to undertake. Even if a problem is acknowledged, it is not clear that it should be addressed at European level. If it is to be addressed at European level, it is not clear that there is a legal base as long as pay is included. It is clear, however, that there would be serious problems in relation to non-pay aspects. The abolition of the temp-to-perm fee will cause chaos in the UK employment agency market. The requirement for the training of temporary workers is likely to create problems because it is not clear that employers hiring people on short-term assignments will be willing to undertake training. If temp-to-perm fees are abolished, it is not clear that agencies will be able to continue to train workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be preferable to forget the whole thing. If the Government had not signed up to the social chapter, they would have the option of saying about the proposal, "We think that this is a bad idea and we are not going to do it. We will have some domestic legislation to address any issues that need to be tackled." The European Union tends to work as a ratchet, and once something like this proposal has been fed into the system, the bureaucratic machinery of Brussels ensures that it is unlikely to go away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to tell the Committee that he will advance the subsidiarity argument in the strongest possible terms and make the case for there being no adequate legal base for the inclusion of pay. If he is ultimately unsuccessful in those endeavours, he should argue for maximum flexibility in the directive, which must include a minimum threshold of 18 months for application of its terms, and national discretion in the choice of comparator, to avoid fluctuating rates of pay for individual agency workers as they move between assignments. The complexities of the UK agency market must be recognised. There must be substantial national flexibility on the temp-to-perm fee to avoid the disaster that would arise for employment agencies and workers seeking temporary work if large numbers of employment agencies were to become non-viable as a result of the directive. I hope that the Minister will address those specific matters in his concluding remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said that when he came into the Committee Room he was ready to give me his unstinting support. I have enough problems with this measure without having the unstinting support of the Opposition, especially as it would be based on the tired, hackneyed old argument that we have the problem because the Government signed up to the social chapter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it absolutely clear that we were pleased to sign up to the social chapter. We agree with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the principles and the values that underpin the European social model, as we told the electorate in 1997 and 2001. That is one of many clear differences between the Government and the Opposition. Not signing the social chapter led the Conservative Government into even more problems in Europe than they had already. On the European works councils directive, for example, because of the opt-out from the social chapter transnational companies based in this country were governed by a European works councils model that affected their employees but over which they had no influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman now seems to support the working time directive; when asked what minimum standards he supported, working times were one of them. Working times, which are part of this directive, too, are dealt with under health and safety. The previous Government found themselves in a terrible mess because they did not realise that; they ended up in front of the European Court of Justice and lost hands down, not on the steps of the court, but inside it. The only thing that they achieved related to the one day off, which under the European works councils directive was to be a Sunday. The party of the church and the family managed to get that proposition removed so that it could be any day of the week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) has made his points eloquently. We have signed up to the social chapter, which brings us to the current position. The Conservative Government were not concerned about protecting workers' rights. The opt-out was not about protecting UK workers, but giving the Tory Government the opportunity, by abolishing wages councils and so forth, to make the UK the sweatshop of Europe. We are now in dialogue and people recognise that we approach the issues from a different position. Where the Tory Government were simply hostile to workers' rights, we want to exert some influence to protect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the issue still depended on unanimity, we could have used another method to block an unattractive proposal, but it now depends on qualified majority voting. Why? That is because the Thatcher Government, under the Single European Act 1985, extended qualified majority voting for these very issues. Rather than waving our bludgeons in the air and opposing anything to do with protecting agency workers, our approach is to influence the European Commission's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge should understand that the proposal is based on two principles: to promote employment and to open up agency working. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich was right when he said that it would not affect our competitive position. Until recently, employment agency working was illegal in some areas of the EU: it became legal in Italy in 1997 and in Germany 25 years ago. The UK, however, has more than 100 years' experience of agency working and regulation. [

Buried somewhere in his long tirade was an attack on workers' rights and ideas that would fundamentally undermine British agencies, which would not be able to compete with agencies employing British workers abroad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not nonsense. My hon. Friend is right. The transnational position is sorted out, but large agencies operate all over Europe. We do not accept that there is no need for the directive. Agency workers deserve protection and we agree with the directive's principles, particularly the opening up of employment agency working in countries with no prior experience of it because it was illegal, and in countries where the protection of permanent jobs militates against agency working. The proposals thus contain advantages for the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I acknowledge some problems and agree with some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. If pay is included—we believe that the directive's legal basis will not allow it—it could cause problems in this country. Let us say that employment agency staff—my wife was one of them—decide to work for a secretarial temping agency that pays £12 an hour. The workers could go to another agency that pays £14 an hour or one that pays £10. There are 17,000 employment agencies that are small and medium enterprises. No one press-gangs people to work for agencies; people choose which agency to work for and know basically what the hourly rate will be wherever they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that situation were to change, and the hourly rate fluctuated depending on where workers were placed, there would not only be a huge bureaucratic burden on the agency and the hiring company; the agency workers would also be affected, and their voice has not been clearly heard in the debate so far. Only 7 per cent. are unionised. Temporary jobs are an important stepping-stone to permanent employment. The percentage of people from ethnic minorities who work for agencies is three times higher than that of ethnic minorities in permanent work. People get into permanent work by going down the agency route, so there is an important social advantage. Our concern is that, if we do not get the directive right, particularly in respect of pay, there will be an adverse effect on employment opportunities for that important group of people.

Another statistic is interesting, given that the Government want to end the long working hours culture. I do not know whether hon. Members heard this morning's report from Japan about people who work 60 hours a week as opposed to 40 hours and have a propensity to heart attacks. We are introducing measures designed to reduce the long hours culture. That is partly about covering hours by using agency workers, rather than overtime. When companies were asked about alternatives to using agency workers if that became prohibitively expensive or bureaucratic, 17 per cent. said that they would not do the work, and 38 per cent. said that they would cover the work through overtime. That unhappy situation is not in line with our approach and our long-term goals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also considering the Better Regulation Task Force recommendations, and whether we can solve problems other than through regulation that may damage the industry. There are important concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to what the Minister is saying and I do not disagree with much of it, but will he be clear about what problems need to be addressed? We have talked in fairly woolly terms about the rights of agency workers, but what is the Government's evidence of abuse that needs to be addressed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our evidence of abuse applies mainly to what we are introducing in domestic legislation. It does not apply to what we are discussing. It applies, for instance, to young girls who want to be models or actresses and the way in which some model agencies take them on and insist that, as part of the deal, they have a particular photographer, who charges an exorbitant amount. The pay arrangements may also be unsatisfactory. All that relates to the regulations that have gone out to laborious consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my opening statement, our major concern in this debate focuses on the fact that, if an agency worker is placed for less than six weeks, there is a derogation. That would cause particular problems in this country. The one thing on which we agree entirely is that companies should not use agency workers as a substitute for permanent employment, and we have suggested a period of a year to 18 months in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a way to get round the problem. Under the Employment Act, we are increasing statutory maternity leave and introducing paternity leave. That is not particularly relevant, because it is only two weeks, but there will also be adoption leave for the first time. There are all kinds of reasons why workers will be absent for longer, and one of the best ways to cover them is through agency staff. We are focusing on that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned a couple of points. We think that the comparator is interesting. The Union of Industrial and Employer's Confederations of Europe has argued that the comparator should be someone in a similar position and that they should be an employment agency worker rather than a worker in the company
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
with which they are placed. We shall consider that interesting proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned derogation for collective agreements. Although I understand his point, that is not an issue in the proposed directive. He mentioned Germany's position and, like many people, unfairly commented on how it has huge unemployment. Germany has gone through reunification, which was a tremendously difficult process. Also, if he compares Germany with the UK during the past 20 years—never mind the past 30 or 40 years—he will find that unemployment has been on average much lower. Furthermore, Germany is not governed by a lot of collective agreements on agency workers. Indeed, recent legislation ensured that temporary workers would get equal treatment on pay and conditions once they had been placed with the company for 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that national pay bargaining and agreements are still used in many sectors in Germany. A worker or an agency placing a worker in an enterprise that falls within one of those still extensive national agreements would know precisely what the worker would earn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, but it does not apply to Germany as much as to eight other European countries, which definitely have sector-wide pay. For example, a French representative can say that the directive will not affect France because it has sector agreements. Secretarial workers get the same rate wherever they are placed, so France does not have the same practical problems as us. It is an important point in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also mention the temp-to-perm issue, on which I agree with the hon. Gentleman. We have spent three years debating it with the employment agency business and we recognise that the fee attached to temp to perm—taking on someone permanently who is a temp involves a transfer fee—is legitimate because agency employers often invest in an individual's training and skills. To avoid such agencies being used as recruitment services, they must have the protection of temp to perm. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we are trying to deal with that problem in proposals on which we are consulting domestically. We are still unclear how the European directive will affect that, but we believe that it would outlaw temp to perm, which is another important concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had our ritual spat earlier, we are finding that we are not divided by much on the substance. How much support does the Minister understand there to be among other member states for the UK position? He clearly set out his objectives, but what can the British Government do if they are in a minority of one, as I suspect they will be, and cannot achieve the flexibility that they want?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to avoid debating hypothetical situations. The Committee rightly asked for debate on the issue as it stands, and it would be wrong for us to speculate on what would happen in certain circumstances and whether we would go for a European Court of Justice judgment. That would only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
happen after an agreement, and it is senseless to speculate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the support from other member states, it would be wrong for me to burden them and speak on record about their position. Discussions are taking place in the right spirit to see what other states' problems are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds as if the Minister is on the retreat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not unusual in negotiations, as the hon. Gentleman will no doubt agree. Colleagues in other member states related some of their views to me in confidence. However, we have a strong argument that persuades other countries that we are not simply saying, "No rights for workers." Our record since 1997 testifies to that and explains that we are clear that the objectives, which are directed to increase employment in the European Union and the use of agency staff, may be better addressed by modifications to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
proposal. Our approach to the negotiations will deliver those outcomes, and will be consistent with our labour market priorities, agency work protection and workable regulations. I ask hon. Members to support the Government's initial approach to negotiations on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
