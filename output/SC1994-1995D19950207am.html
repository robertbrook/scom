	<div class='title'>INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your good wishes, Mr. Winterton. I did not go to Murrayfield, but I am pleased to report that Scotland won against the odds. Having dealt with the sporting matters, I hope that you will allow the same latitude in discussing clause 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to canvass a number of matters, to which I would like a response from the Minister. The Committee will recall that insurance premium tax was the subject of much debate a year ago. It was one of two new taxes introduced last year and it is effectively VAT on insurance. Many issues of principle were covered in Committee last year and many points made by hon. Members on both sides of Committee deserve further consideration before we reach schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 does nothing more than bring schedule 5 into operation—we shall discuss that in our next debate—but the Committee must consider whether the clause should be allowed to stand part of the Bill in the light of what has happened during the past 12 months. My first point—the country will expect us to make it—is to ask the Minister to give a commitment that the Government do not intend further to extend the scope of insurance premium tax. That is important. We had long and considered debates last year on the scope of the tax and I understood men that it was agreed that the Government did not intend a further extension. However, as with VAT, I ask the Minister to state clearly and unequivocally whether they intend to review or extend the scope of insurance premium tax during the coming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would refer to the tax rate, which was reduced from 3 per cent, to 2.5 per cent, following changes to the way in which the tax is collected. It would be helpful if he would tell the Committee whether the Government intend to increase the rate. That is crucial because it is arguable that a rate of 2.5 per cent.—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to listen to the debate—as, I hope, does the Committee. Hon. Members must not conduct loud conversations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rate is important. While 2.5 per cent, is a relatively low rate, it would become a greater burden
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
if it were to be increased. Many people believe that once a Government have introduced a tax, even at a low rate, it is only a matter of time before the rate gradually creeps up from 2.5 per cent, to 3 per cent., to 3.5 per cent, and then to 4 per cent. That happened with VAT—in 1979 it was only 8 per cent., but it is now 17.5 per cent. When Ministers say that they do not intend to increase the rate of tax, that can often be translated to mean that they have every intention of doing so after the next general election, but will not say so before that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the rate is quite low at present, it is a significant burden for many people. Before the clause is allowed to stand part of the Bill we are entitled to find out from the Government what effect the tax has had since it was introduced. During last year's debate, I and other hon. Members drew attention to the fact that there is a surprisingly low rate of general insurance cover in this country. I had assumed that most people insure their cars, but the statistics for last year show that in some parts of the country it is not uncommon for only just over 50 per cent, of cars to be insured. That suggests that many people may be driving without insurance or with inadequate insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record is not much better on home insurance. In Greater London, for example, only 51 per cent, of home owners have insured the structure of their homes. I shall talk about the difference between house structure and house contents insurance shortly, but Ministers should pay attention to that statistic. We should know whether the tax affects people's propensity to insure. We are in no doubt that it is in the public interest, as well as the individual's interest, that people should be adequately insured. We are entitled to ask the Minister what the effect of the tax has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of home owners, I understand that later this year we shall debate an order that will allow the Government to withdraw income support from those who currently enjoy help with paying their mortgages when they lose their jobs—a topic in which you, Mr. Winterton, may be interested in another capacity. Clearly, we are concerned about that order. The Government's attitude is, "Never mind, they can take out home insurance." Everybody knows what will happen—not only will people at risk of unemployment have to pay a higher premium, they will also have to pay insurance premium tax. The Government will gain twice over. They will not have to pay out in income support and other benefits and they will gather revenue from insurance. Although 2.5 per cent, is a comparatively small rate, it is significant because it will cost the average home owner several hundred pounds to obtain the sort of insurance needed to cover his mortgage and pay the additional 2.5 per cent, tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we agree to any further changes in the insurance premium tax regime or allow clause 28 to stand part of the Bill, we are entitled to ask the Government what effect the changes are likely to have on current levels of insurance and what effect the Government think the changes will have on those people who will have to take out household insurance in the event of the Government succeeding in reducing support for home owners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that any increases resulting from the tax would be dwarfed by reductions in premiums—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
especially for household contents insurance—because of the major reduction in crime, especially in some parts of our large cities? If he agrees with that, can he explain why his party did not facilitate the rapid passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to become too bogged down in that Act because I am sure that you, Mr. Winterton, will stop me when you resume your customary keen attention. Perhaps I should have taken the window of opportunity offered by your temporary lack of attention and spoken about the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's criticism is odd, because the Labour party has been criticised by those outside this place for not having opposed parts of that Act. The truth is, as the hon. Gentleman knows, that we were keen for those parts of the Act that we supported to be put on the statute book, but we opposed other parts such as those dealing with the abolition of the right to silence and the concept of aggravated trespass. The hon. Gentleman has not made an especially good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the major reduction in crime, I accept that there has been a statistical improvement in crime figures in the past year, but most people's experience is that the crime rate has not improved. The rates of car theft and house break-ins are so high that it is now rare to meet someone who has not been the victim of both crimes. During the first 40 years of my life I experienced neither car theft nor housebreaking; during the past 24 months, I have been the victim of both. My car was pinched two years ago and our house was broken into last summer. That is a common experience. If I were the hon. Gentleman, I should be very careful about saying that the crime rate has dropped and that there is nothing more to worry about, because public experience is that the crime rate has not dropped and they are still feeling the effects of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has unwittingly led me on to my next point, which is that we should be worried by the fact that many areas of this country are virtually uninsurable—I speak of geographical areas, not insurance areas. Again, the insurance premium tax has, in some cases, been the straw that has broken the camel's back. Of course, all insurers will say that there is no such thing as an uninsurable risk—provided one is prepared to pay the premium. However, areas that have suffered most from crime are often—although not always—areas where per capita income is fairly low. That means that insurance premium and insurance premium tax take a bigger slice of most people's income than they would, I suspect, from the income of the majority of members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is just a glimmer of hope that one or two members of the Government are beginning to consider the question of social policy after a 16-year rest from that subject. It is a matter of social policy when there are areas in which people cannot get insurance. If an area is uninsurable, one way or another eventually the public purse will have to pick up the pieces. That occurred with the recent flooding in Paisley, where there was much loss. After that flood, many people wanted to obtain insurance, but some people either could not afford it or, because their house was in a certain locality, insurers said, "Sorry, we are not prepared to insure you unless you pay a premium that is outwith the reach of many people." On top of all that, there is now the insurance premium tax. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
Government must tell us their view of likely developments in this area before think of nodding through any amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have emphasised time and again that insurance should be encouraged. It is not in the interest of any Governnment, whatever their political persuasion, for people not to insure their risks. They should be encouraged to insure their risks, so the wrong signals should not be sent out. Many people got the wrong signal when the tax was introduced, partly because no one knew anything about it. Surprisingly, the Government did not mention it in their election manifesto. That must have been an oversight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be pleased to learn that one matter about which Labour Members are worried is not entirely the Government's fault. Insurance companies have changed their attitude towards their insured—or their customers, as I dare say the Government would call them. Rates for general insurance have dropped in the past 12 months. I thought that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) was going to make that point, but he did not. The Minister should do so if he has done his research. To some extent, many people will not have seen insurance premium tax make a difference to the gross premium that they pay. Rates dropped because of telephone sales. I should not care to advertise in Committee or anywhere else, but hon. Members will know that direct selling of general insurance is now taking off. It was pioneered by one company, which is probably best known for the fact that its managing director's wages make a director of a privatised utility look like he is living in absolute penury. He is at the vanguard of the wages scale. Obviously, direct selling has brought beneficial changes, but the problem is that insurance companies have tended to go in for what might loosely be called cherry picking. It is perfectly true that one can obtain a quotation, but people who are bad risks are simply turned down. From a commercial point of view, companies are perfectly entitled to do that. Although we want insurance companies to be competitive, to offer choice and to reduce premiums, a growing cohort of people—including some who are uninsurable—will find it harder to get insurance. That concerns all members of the Committee, in terms of both social and economic policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument appears to be that a tax of £2.50 in every £100 is the straw that breaks the camel's back. Is not he being a little disingenuous? Many poor people, on whose behalf he says he is speaking, do not invariably insure in the first place. What effect does their decision not to insure have upon his argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a terribly good point. I was not just speaking for the poor people, as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) put it. I was speaking on behalf of most people in the country, which is what the Labour party does. Conservative Members might care to reflect on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to make it clear that we are dealing with various categories of people. There are people who want to insure but cannot get insurance because their risk is not insurable at a price they can afford. That category includes, for example, houses with subsidence in coalmining areas or houses in areas that are liable to flooding. Some people are uninsured because they will not insure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
That category is by no means confined to those whom the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington would call poor people. There are people driving around in cars who could perfectly well afford to insure them, but do not do so. However, there are also people who simply cannot afford insurance. It was of that category of people that I said that insurance premium tax might have been the straw that broke the camel's back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person is planning a household budget and an increased bill arrives, that person will consider whether to continue the insurance policy. Other people who are moderately well off and who have insurance policies will consider each year whether they need that cover. That inevitably happens if insurance rates increase, although general insurance rates came down this year. The principle of the tax is important. It is 2.5 per cent, now, but no one believes that it will stay at that rate indefinitely. It is bound to be the target of a Chancellor looking for ways to raise money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider those principles. It is not just a matter of how much money is brought into the Treasury's coffers; it is a matter of social and economic policy. That was my point. If the hon. Gentleman has a better point to make, I shall certainly listen to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying—and his arguments appear to be powerful—that if his party were to come to office and he were to be a Treasury Minister, he would not increase insurance premium tax beyond 2.5 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said time and again that our tax proposals will be made clear at the appropriate time. That is sensible. I shall quote the exchange between the now Lord Barnett and the now Lord Lawson on Second Reading of the Finance Bill on 3 April 1979, to which the Committee should pay careful attention. I am sure that all hon. Members remember both those gentlemen who, in their own ways, were distinguished holders of high office in the Treasury. When they were discussing the then Conservative Opposition's tax policies, Lord Barnett said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would be interested to know the policy of the Opposition on this matter."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 3 April 1979; Vol. 965, 
	<i>c.</i> 1258]</p></blockquote>
Lord Lawson said, "Wait and see". Lord Barnett responded by saying that the Government did not know the Opposition's policy on taxes. Is not it strange that that exchange between a Minister and an Opposition spokesman 16 years ago is being repeated here today? I shall simply use the words of Lord Lawson—wait and see. If it is good enough for Lord Lawson, it is good enough for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If all that the hon. Gentleman is saying, albeit verbosely, is that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, why does he persist in trying to extract from Ministers their future plans for taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may not have noticed this, but that lot of Ministers are in Government. For that reason we are entitled to ask what they are going to do. The Government have formidable past form on this matter. The hon. Gentleman will remember that in 1979, no doubt under the banner of "wait and see", the
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
Government forgot to mention that they were going to double VAT in the first Budget after the 1979 election. They forgot to mention in this Parliament that, for example, they were going to increase VAT on fuel and impose the insurance premium tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When considering past form, the difficulty for Opposition spokesmen, including the hon. Gentleman, is the need to draw a veil over some incidents that came to public prominence, such as the discussions at Luigi's restaurant before the most recent general election, when it became abundantly clear that whatever the Government's plans, Labour's proposal was to tax far more than any Conservative Government would have contemplated. The only problem was that the then shadow Chancellor and the then Leader of the Opposition could not agree on their tax plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, that was an extremely long intervention, which I deplore, and secondly, hon. Members are drifting wide of the debate. I am not interested in the taxation history of the Conservative and Labour parties. I want to return to discussing clause 28.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to get back to discussing insurance, but for the record the hon. Gentleman is wrong—as he is on many matters. I dare say that such taxation matters will be of direct relevance to later debates—and, who knows, we may even reach them this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to insurance, which we are supposed to be discussing, I should like to respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. He has obviously gone away to reflect on his folly for having raised such matters, but when he returns I shall address him directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alongside the introduction of the insurance premium tax, there has been a change in attitude in insurance companies, which is to be regretted. Understandably, insurance companies are very concerned about fraud. In part, that concern stems from the unfortunate tendency of people to regard insurance companies as a soft touch. However, that has not been helped by the fact that companies frequently used to pay out £500 automatically without questioning a claim. When our carpets were flooded and destroyed we put in a claim. The carpets then miraculously recovered so we told the insurance company that we did not need to claim, but we were sent a cheque for being so honest. That is very kind, but it is a bad policy to pay out automatically and insurance companies are now suffering because of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unintended consequence is that insurance companies now routinely regard most of their claimants as fraudsters. I recently came across the case of a constituent who had suffered a break-in in which various items of jewellery were stolen. There was no question that there had been a burglary and the value of what had been stolen was agreed, but the insurance company refused to pay cash. Instead, my constituent was told to go to a nominated jeweller to buy jewellery up to the agreed value. Many items were of sentimental value and were irreplaceable—a grandfather's cufflinks cannot be replaced, no matter how wonderful the new piece of jewellery is. It also turned out that the nominated shopkeeper received a 15 per cent. cut. What is more, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
money was credited to the shopkeeper's account and he then told my constituent that she could draw down on the account from time to time. That seemed to me to be wholly undesirable, but it arose because the insurance company had decided that too many people committed fraud. I put it to the company, on behalf of my constituent, that if she was being accused of fraud, she should be told that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was settled to everyone's satisfaction, but it is unfortunate that companies are behaving in that way. Unless there is trust between the public and the insurance companies, people will tend not to insure. That change in attitude, together with the insurance premium tax, may mean fewer people will take out insurance, which is not in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance companies would do well to remember the doctrine of uberrimae fidei which, when I practised law, was a fundamental tenet of insurance contracts—that they should be of the utmost faith. The companies must rebuild the trust between themselves and their customers if they are to encourage people to insure, which is in their interests, in the public interest and in the interests of the Government of the day. Otherwise, people may take the view that it is better to have money in the bank and forget about insurance, because if something is stolen at least there will be some savings to dig into. That is not a satisfactory solution, but the Government would have to consider that scenario were they to think of increasing the insurance premium tax—a move which could drive more people into believing that insuring is not worthwhile. That needs to be considered alongside the change in attitudes of insurance companies, which is wholly undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us whether the total number of policies and the premiums paid have gone up or down in the past 12 months? Last year we passed into law a battery of clauses and schedules—and we shall shortly be invited to endorse schedule 5 to this Bill—all of which give the Government powers to obtain almost any information that they want. I should be interested to know whether that battery of information includes the answer to my question so that we can find out whether the concerns expressed in various places about the effect of the insurance premium tax have been realised. I am sure that the Minister has such information and it would be interesting for the Committee to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, can the Minister tell us the cost of administering the tax? I know that it is the industry, not the Government, that administers it, but the Government's attitude appears to be similar to that which we heard on deferred annuities—they said that it does not cost the public purse anything because the industry bears the cost. That is all very well, except that the industry does not bear the cost, the public do. Policyholders pay the premiums, which include an element for administration, including the cost of collecting the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful to know what effect the tax has had. The most recent figures that I can find show that the tax affects 16.5 million and is paid by 85 per cent, of households, so the cost of collecting it must be significant. I cannot believe that it costs nothing. The industry continually tells us that regulatory costs are an increasing burden, and, to some extent, collection of tax on behalf of the Government must be a burden. I am sure that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
Minister will shortly have at his fingertips details of what that cost is because it is important for us to know what burdens we are imposing. I understand that the Government follow a certain procedure when they examine the compliance costs—especially for small businesses—of their proposals and it would be useful to know what the Government's estimate was last year and what it is this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For most people the tax is unavoidable because most people insure. The only way to avoid it is not to insure, which is wholly undesirable. Therefore, before we make any further changes to the insurance premium tax regime, we are entitled to know what effect the tax is having. If the Minister tells us that the Government are minded to increase the scope or rate of the tax—although I expect his remarks on that subject today will be brief—the costs and effect of the tax will change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the scope of the tax, will the Minister also tell us whether the Government intend to exempt anything that is currently covered? I know that intense lobbying is being carried out by certain groups, not least the private health industry. If the Government are minded to accede to those representations we would like to know about it. I am asking the Government for an evaluation of the effects of the tax on insurance, which I am sure they will carry out, as any responsible Government would. I also hope that insurance companies will bear in mind that they cannot blame the Government—any Government—for everything and that they must change their attitudes towards customers, otherwise people will be driven away and may decide that they do not need to insure, which would be an unfortunate and foolish course of action in the long term. If there must be small print, it is high time that it became very large print.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax was unpopular when it was introduced, not least because the Government forgot to tell the public that it was proposed. The fear is that the Government will regard it as a soft touch in future. We know that the Government's strategy is to cut direct taxation this autumn in a desperate attempt to shore up support. The temptation will be to recover the tax through indirect taxation, such as the insurance premium tax. Neither the Committee nor the House should simply nod through further changes to the insurance premium tax regime until we have had a proper look at its effect. As I have said, it has great social and economic consequences and, therefore, before we agree to anything we are entitled to a full explanation from the Minister of what has happened during the past 12 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have, so far, allowed an extremely broad debate. If other hon. Members wish to raise the subject in general I am happy for them to do so, but I give notice that, under the next schedule, I do not intend to permit a wide-ranging debate. It must be specific to the schedule and to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 is, as has been noted, a brisk little clause and does not, in itself, do very much. It leads on to the guts of the amendments to the tax contained in schedule 5. As you have said, Mr. Winterton, that you will allow a general debate on the clause to pre-empt repetition in relation to schedule 5, I shall follow your direction and give the Committee an update on how the new tax is turning out in practice. Of course, it is only four months

	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
old and, although a picture is evolving, I cannot give a definitive answer to the question of what the first yearly revenue from the tax will be. Neither can I answer in full all the questions asked by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. Those answers will depend on the review, which he thought would be a sensible undertaking and which we envisage conducting with Customs and Excise when we have a little more experience of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can report to the Committee that the tax is working well in practice, not least because we are working closely with the insurance companies. I should like to pay tribute to the way in which they have responded to the new tax by working closely with Customs and Excise. A sign of that co-operation is that we exposed the changes in schedule 5 to the industry for comment and have taken their views into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the tax applies at 2.5 per cent, to premiums in respect of most forms of general insurance, where the insured risk is located in the United Kingdom. There are several exemptions: all reinsurance; all life and other long-term insurance; certain insurance relating to aircraft, ships, lifeboats and export finance; and block insurance that is held by Motability, which covers disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the scope of the tax. I confirm that, at this stage, the Government have no plans for fundamental changes to the scope as laid down in legislation. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central gave no assurance about any future rate: he implied that Labour would decide on that when it had an opportunity to influence that rate. That may mean that Labour Members cannot wait to get their hands on the tax in due course to fund their expenditure ambitions. Likewise, I can give no assurance about a future Budget when we are discussing the current one: however, the scope and rate of the tax are delivering roughly what we anticipated at the time, and we should bear in mind that several changes have happened to the insurance industry over the past year, including a general reduction in premiums. That reduction has been partly due to the fact that—as my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne mentioned—happily, crime has fallen somewhat. In addition, the insurance industry has a cyclical nature and premium rates have eased. There has also been renewed competition from organisations that are either selling insurance directly or are purporting to do so. That has reduced premiums in some aspects. Combined with low inflation, those factors will inevitably affect overall revenue for a full year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister referred to scope, he used the word "fundamental". Can I draw him more on that aspect? Are the Government contemplating any changes in the scope? It is a matter of opinion as to whether the changes are fundamental. As the Government are now in consultative mode and are bringing the insurance industry along with them, it would be helpful if they could also include the public and the Committee, and let us know what fundamental means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, I have no intention of changing the scope. However, I read out some exemptions, which, in many cases, are fairly complex and
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
require fairly tight definitions. As with all taxes—certainly in the case of VAT—from time to time it may be necessary to alter the boundary line between exempt and not exempt. I cannot see the need for such changes, which is why at this stage none have been introduced. The hon. Gentleman referred to the need for a review. That will certainly be conducted when we have greater experience of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little reluctant to give way further at this stage, as I am responding to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. If the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) is lucky enough to catch your eye, Mr. Winterton, and ask me questions, I shall endeavour to respond at the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that I should say more about efforts that we have made to work in partnership with the insurance industry, because that touches on the question of compliance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to helping the insurers to meet their obligations. Therefore we operate a flexible administrative regime whereby individual insurers may agree specific accounting arrangements with their local insurance premium tax office. That enables the tailoring of the tax requirements to existing accounting systems to minimise the cost of compliance. A number of changes were made to the tax because of requests from the industry. For example, we introduced the written premium method as an alternative to cash accounting. As has already been mentioned, there was also a shift to accounting for tax on gross rather than net premiums. Those are examples of real achievements resulting from close co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, Customs and Excise has deliberately employed a light touch in the first few months of the tax as regards the imposition of penalties and interest, and that will continue until the end of the first 12-month period. Co-operation, not confrontation, has been the guiding principle behind the tax. The Association of British Insurers has been consulted, every step of the way, on how to implement the tax in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about specific compliance costs. I can confirm that administration by Customs and Excise is expected to cost approximately £6 million per annum, which is less than 1p in the pound of tax collected. That is low by taxation standards. Customs and Excise prepared an assessment of compliance costs based on industry estimates and it is still a valid calculation that the ongoing costs for the United Kingdom general insurance company market are in the region of £7.5 million per annum. I mentioned yield figures, which are, of course, difficult to calculate to the full year when we are only at the beginning of the implementation of the tax. I also mentioned how pressure on premiums may well reduce the nominal revenue from the tax in the first full year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the separate point made about the cost of the tax for households and its incidence, the calculations made when this matter was debated last year are still generally valid. The figures based on the then latest available family expenditure survey indicate that the average expenditure on IPT across all households is approximately 23p a week. For the poorest 20 per cent, of households, IPT will cost about 7p a week, whereas the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
richest 20 per cent, of households will pay IPT of about 46p a week, so the tax is clearly mildly progressive in its incidence in that better-off people will spend a slightly higher percentage of their income on the tax than those who are less well off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that covers the points raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. Of course, I shall respond as required during the rest of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assurances given by the Minister about the scope and the rate of VAT were somewhat niggardly. Indeed, the words used about having no plans at this stage recalled the words used by both his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer before the most recent general election about the value added tax. We all know what has happened since—value added tax has been increased. I hope that when the Minister winds up the debate on clause 28 he will go further toward reassuring not only members of the Committee and Members of Parliament but, more importantly, members of the public that the imposition of the new tax will not open the floodgates to a major increase in premiums across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The popular assumption is that IPT applies only to households and cars, but already it is being applied to extended warranties on electrical goods and membership of breakdown recovery services such as the AA and RAC. I know that last year the Minister received representations from those organisations expressing concern about the new tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 28 gives the Minister an opportunity to go a little further in offering assurances. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central said, this is a deeply unpopular tax. The two reasons for that are, first, it is largely unavoidable and, secondly, it is, contrary to what the Minister has just said, extremely discriminatory. It is unavoidable because its impact is felt in 16.5 million households—those with any form of insurance now pay an extra 2.5 per cent, on their premiums. When the full year revenue effects of the tax are fully realised in a year or so, the impact will be substantial—more than £800 of revenue will be raised from IPT. That is a lot of additional insurance premiums that ordinary members of the public will have to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps more worryingly, the tax is discriminatory because it hits hardest at the most vulnerable. The Minister argued that the tax is mildly progressive in that it has least impact on the poorest and greatest impact on the rich; but he did not say that the tax is discriminatory and unfair in the sense that it hits hardest at high-crime areas, whether in poor or rich parts of the community. In my constituency premiums have risen considerably during the past few years as a direct consequence of rising crime rates. Motor insurance premiums rose by some 36 per cent, in real terms between 1987 and 1992, the year of the previous general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central highlighted the fact that many households simply do not take out any sort of insurance cover. In the north we have the lowest incidence of motor insurance cover—only 55 per cent, of owners are properly covered. That is very
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
worrying, because an awful lot of people are driving with no cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Motor insurance is not the only cause for concern—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not simply the drivers of cars who are not covered; the victims of accidents will also be the victims of failure to insure properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a key point, because motorists are encouraged to be irresponsible. Households are hard pressed at present. I am quoting from a very reliable source—the vice-chairman of the Conservative party, John Maples, informed all of us that living standards fell last year and will fall this year and the year after. That must be an incentive for people who are hard pressed to cut back on items if they think that they can get away with it and, unfortunately, insurance may come into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) rightly said, inevitably those who must bear the consequences of that policy are those who are tragically involved in road traffic accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in high crime areas—unfortunately, the northern region has had a major increase in crime in the past few years—are already paying through their pockets because of increased insurance premiums, before the advent of IPT. Home buildings insurance has increased by 29 per cent, in that period and home contents insurance has increased by 13 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central referred to the recent good news that insurance premiums are falling. My hon. Friend mentioned the advent of telesales as a major factor that has prompted that fall. That is very welcome, but without insurance premium tax, those taking out policies would have benefited to an even greater extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason—which my hon. Friend did not mention—why insurance premiums across the board are falling is that insurance companies are now employing a deliberate policy of better targeting. What does that mean? It means taking advantage of all the advances in computer technology and other sectors that we have all seen in recent years to identify the post code regions with the highest incidence of crime. When I became a Member of the House and moved to SW9 I had to ring half a dozen insurance companies before I could get cover because of my post code. I am sure that I am not alone among members of the Committee in that experience. My hon. Friend the Labour Whip, the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) is laughing because he had similar problems—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall not be tempted to mention my hon. Friend's former occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that insurance companies are employing better targeting. An article in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> at the end of last year quoted Rebecca Hadley of the AA, who confirmed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Contents policies have fallen by an average of over 1 per cent."</p></blockquote>
She went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A key reason is that insurers are now able to assess risks more accurately than before… This means there is far more polarisation in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
premiums with those for some areas going down while others go up".</p></blockquote>
There was an interesting article in 
	<i>Which?</i> magazine recently for which a team of researchers investigated how easy it was to obtain a quote for insurance for a house in a high-risk category. They contacted 16 insurers anonymously, asking for quotes on a three-bedroom house in London with two theft claims in the previous years. Only one insurer would quote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through no fault of their own, people living in high-crime areas are now facing higher insurance bills, on top of which they have the pleasure of paying 2.5 per cent, insurance premium tax. In what way can that be described as progressive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Friday I visited a council estate in Darlington to talk to some women who have started a second-hand clothes shop mere. They told me about the spate of crime that has afflicted a street in which several of them live. They have all been burgled recently, with the usual household accessories such as video recorders, TVs and hi-fis taken. Not one of them had household insurance. The imposition of an extra 2.5 per cent, tax on such households is a further disincentive to insure, which can only undermine the Government's expressed social and economic philosophy of wishing to create a classless society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a disincentive to insure, and if households lose goods and have to replace them, the spiral of poverty will become ever deeper. IPT may be 2.5 per cent, now, but it affects some households more than others. Heaven knows what its impact would be if it rose to the present rate of VAT, for example. IPT is a tax borne by all our constituents. It is a tax on people's protection from crime. When the Minister said that he had no plans at present to increase the scope or rate of VAT, I was reminded of the pledges given by his party at the general election to keep crime low and to keep tax low. Unfortunately, as this tax proves, the Conservative party has become me party of high crime and high tax. I would not mind as much if I was assured that the proceeds, which are substantial—about £800 million a year once the tax is fully in force—went to benefit the victims of crime or were applied to reduce crime rates. But the proceeds are not about tackling crime; they are about tackling the financial problems of the past created by hon. Members who have sat on the Treasury Front Bench in previous Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will feel able to go further and at least have the good sense to avoid the sort of language that has created such suspicion not only in the minds of Opposition Members, but in the minds of the public who no longer trust what Ministers say about the scope and rate of taxes in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friends who have called for a commitment from the Paymaster General regarding the scope of the tax, although I do so with a little more scepticism than my colleagues. If we examine the record for the past few years, it appears that the more the Government deny that they will increase a tax, the more likely they are to increase it. So I am sceptical about pushing the Paymaster General to stand up in Committee and deny on a stack of bibles a foot high that the Government have no plans to extend the scope of the tax—but I shall do so anyway. I shall press the Paymaster General not only on the Government's record of keeping
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
their promises—VAT is an excellent example of how they cynically reneged on their commitment—but on the commitment for which my hon. Friends have asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, ask for that commitment because if we examine how the tax will be administered, we see that there are ominous signs of direct comparisons with VAT and Customs and Excise. The same structures apply as those that apply to VAT under the relevant schedules. The dreaded phrase "value added tax" keeps emerging. Hon. Members are entitled to be suspicious about the Government's plans, especially when the Government say that they have no plans to extend me scope of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts that another stated objective of Government policy and, indeed, of the policy of all members of the European Union, is to harmonise VAT, other taxes and excise duties throughout the Union. He will know that no other country in the Union imposes VAT on insurance business. He will also know that most other countries of the Union have a similar tax to that under discussion. Is not his supposition fundamentally flawed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say with all sincerity that I wish my supposition was flawed. I hope that we can trust the Government not to extend the scope of the tax, but I put it to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) that the Government's record of keeping then-promises on taxation does not fill one with confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting argument increasingly put by Conservative Members is that what is done in Europe should be done here. I am not sure how that would square with the philosophy of many of the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends. I have never fully understood the argument that because someone else taxes in a particular way, we should tax a particular way. I do not think that that argument stands up to scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a commitment in the harmonisation proposals to move towards equality of indirect taxation levels in the European Community; wide variations exist in those taxation levels. We do not want the Government to use those different levels, or to use any move towards harmonisation or equality, as an excuse to extend the scope of or to raise the insurance premium tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just read an article in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In other EC countries, the tax on insurance can be as high as 30 per cent on some types of insurance, although a more normal level is 5 to 10 per cent."</p></blockquote>
There are clearly quite high taxes on insurance in some European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. It illustrates the point well and is another reason why we need the firmest possible commitment from me Paymaster General on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I become increasingly worried when I hear the Paymaster General say that there has been an overall reduction in premiums. Before I explore that in detail, I must say that it is again apparent that an important part of the Government's argument for increasing indirect taxation is that in some circumstances, the price of a service or commodity has been reduced. The Treasury steps in and says, "We're not having the consumers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
benefiting from this. Not a bit of it. We will ensure that the Treasury gets its money." That is the first call of any alleged reductions in the cost of any particular commodity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When looking through the documentation, I am struck by how amazing it is that one's concern becomes reality. According to the money column in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> in December 1994, the average cost of building insurance policies has dropped by 2.5 per cent, since last July. What do we have here? Miracle of miracles, we have a 2.5 per cent, tax on home premiums. That might be a coincidence, but I do not believe so. It is a direct illustration of the way in which the Government cynically try to justify the tax increases. They say, "It does not really matter because the consumer benefited from lower prices." However, consumers will not benefit from lower prices because the Treasury will ensure that they do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any taxation system, there must be a degree of fairness. The Paymaster General has said that there is an element of progression in the tax. There is no such thing. The Government must explain why the Treasury sees fit to grab any reduction in the price of a service, which means that home owners are penalised and do not benefit from any decrease in the cost of premiums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is disputing the data from the family expenditure survey, he should provide us with additional figures and show why the collection or analysis of data in the survey is flawed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General might have used his intervention to deny that the 2.5 per cent, insurance premium tax was the same as what the money column in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> estimated the fall in premiums would be, whether through competition, direct selling or anything else. Why is the tax the same as the fall in premiums? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will explain that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General said that the survey that he mentioned showed that the average cost would be 23p—I am not sure whether that is per pound or in total—and that the richest, poor souls, would pay 46p. They have benefited from the largesse of the Government's tax cuts since the mid-1980s, but one must nevertheless sympathise with the richest 10 per cent. The poorest, the survey showed, would pay 7p. Those are, of course, average figures. However, what proportion of the income of the poorest does 7p represent? That is the real test. One cannot simply quote bald figures. The Paymaster General is perfectly entitled to argue along the lines that he has done but, as he challenged me on the point, he must give some information about the impact that the tax will have on the richest and the poorest, not just by giving us the figures in pence per pound, but by assessing the proportion of a person's income that the tax represents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman again. I indicated in may initial remarks that the tax is mildly progressive because the figures for the incidence of the tax on the poorest 20 per cent, are a smaller

percentage of household expenditure and income than that pertaining to the richest 20 per cent. In answer to the hon. Gentleman, it is a progressive tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Several of my hon. Friends have made the point that the tax is discriminatory, and there is no doubt that that is the case. In that respect, I believe that it breaches one of the fundamental approaches to any taxation system. Is it fair? Despite the whirlwind conversion of the Paymaster General from being mildly progessive to totally progressive—I do not accept that conversion—there is a serious element of discrimination. I should like to offer a couple of examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, many home owners have bought their homes in good faith and have had the necessary surveys carried out. Some of those people bought their homes many years ago and—and as many people do—sank their life savings into their properties. Buying a home is one of the biggest purchases that people make. Through no fault of their own—this issue has come up because of Government changes to British Coal—some of those people find old mine shafts near their properties. I am not suggesting that those mine shafts are the

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But not under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that with your patience and forbearance, Mr. Winterton, you will understand the point that I am trying to make. Those people—I know of several hundred—in some cases cannot get home insurance and in others pay premiums that have rocketed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General mentioned a review and I welcome that commitment as, I think, will everyone. I hope that as part of that review. When the Paymaster General concludes, he will give us a commitment that the serious discrimination inherent in the tax will be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example of discrimination is clearly shown by the insurers. They are cherry picking. They love it. They say, "We'll knock at your door and talk to you, and offer you all sorts of packages. First, however, we'll check the area you live in. If you live in a high-crime area, heaven help you. Your premiums will be far higher—even if you get the insurance—than if you live elsewhwere."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation is no fault of home owners. It is not then-fault that the Government have failed in their law-and-order policy. It is not their fault that Government ineptitude and incompetence have made crime rates in their area so high. Yet, as a direct result of the way in which the tax will be implemented, they face serious discrimination. There is no point telling those constituents of mine who are suffering that they should not worry because if they are on the bread line, the tax will cost them only 7p in the pound or, for those with a Rolls-Royce—I do not think that there are any Rolls-Royces in my constituency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. You obviously know my constituency better than I do. For the richest, the figure will be 46p. It is no good talking in those terms because it is completely unrealistic. The premiums have rocketed up through no fault of home owners. That has to be rammed into the Government's consciousness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is so keen on lower insurance premiums, can he explain to the Committee why the Insurance Companies (Reserves) Bill—which would undoubtedly have been of great benefit and would have brought lower insurance premiums—was talked out in the House recently by three of his hon. Friends, the Members for Tooting (Mr. Cox), for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) and for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will talk to my hon. Friends about that, but I want no lessons from Conservative Members about talking Bills out. I look to you, Mr. Winterton, for protection from that. I shall be in the House on Friday morning watching the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the height of ridiculousness to quote figures, as the Paymaster General has done—23p on average, 7p for the poorest and 46p for the richest—when those figures are meaningless to those who are affected by high crime
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
through no fault of their own. They happen to live in such areas and because of the state of the housing market and negative equity—which again show the failure of Government policies—they are unlikely to be able to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should press the Paymaster General on that point. If he will not address it now, at least we can flag it up for the review because it is very important. It is one thing taxing people on whatever money they are making, but it is another thing to have such discrimination when individuals or families have no power at all to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) made a point about car insurance which emphasises the discrimination. It struck me that even though there is cherry picking in the car insurance market, at least one can draw a distinction between good drivers and bad drivers. It is an arguable distinction, but the difference can be recognised as a factor. How does one do that for home owners? How does one distinguish between a good home owner and a bad home owner and therefore adjust the relevant payments that result from the tax? It is not possible because as a result of the Government's failure on crime, home owners have no control over the factors that determine the costs of their home insurance premiums. That is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is contradicting the police's assertions that people can protect themselves against crime. A lot of the petty crime that he has described is opportunistic—people see windows or doors left open because properties are not being protected as carefully as they could be. The hon. Gentleman should accept that there is a lot that home owners can do individually and collectively, through neighbourhood watch schemes. In many areas that previously had high crime, neighbours have got together, determined to operate against crime, with significant results. Surely he should recognise that that is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What bothers me most is that as a result of this additional burden on the family budget, which the Government seem determined to impose, the prospect of people taking further such measures will be greatly reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me on to my last point—I am sure members of the Committee are breathing sighs of relief—which is the effect on home owners and their families. If this was an isolated tax—if someone at the Treasury had woken up one morning and said, "Wouldn't it be a good idea to put a tax on home insurance? Let's do it."—the overall situation would not be so bad. But it is not an isolated tax; it is an important element in a concerted taxation attack on families and home owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is likely to be the effect of the tax on insurance cover in general? When examining the information that is available, I am reminded that in my own region—the west midlands—expenditure on home insurance from 1987–88 to 1992 has risen almost 31 per cent., I believe that that is the third highest figure in the country. Despite all measures described by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West, the west midlands will therefore start from a much higher cost base.

What will happen to those people who become unemployed? Tragically, despite the Government's statistics to the contrary, people are still losing their jobs—certainly in my constituency and in yours, Mr. Winterton. First, the jobseekers allowance halves their benefit. Secondly, from October, DSS support for mortgage interest payments will not be available for the first nine months in the case of new mortgages and for the first two months for current ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see you frowning, Mr. Winterton, but the point I am making is that, added to that is this swingeing, discriminatory home insurance tax, the likely effect of which is that families will not take out home insurance because they cannot afford it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance is one of the first things to fall off the edge of the table. Conservative Members may think that fanciful, but in the real world, it is not fanciful. People make those decisions every day after losing their jobs and being hit by tax increases totalling 7p in the pound, imposed by a Government who claim to be the party of low taxation. People who have lost their jobs, who live in a high crime rate area and so have to pay a higher home insurance premium through no fault of their own, whom the Government will not help with the mortgage interest payments, who have a family to feed and keep, whose jobseekers allowance has halved their unemployment benefit and for whom there is no prospect of obtaining work, will decide that insurance should be the first tiling to go. I know that if I had to choose between the welfare of my family and having home insurance, which is important, but not mandatory and will be unaffordable as a direct result of the tax, I would not be likely to choose home insurance. Figures for insurance, which are already very low in many parts of the country, will become lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West has left the Room so I shall address his chair, but if he were here, I should put the question to him. How will all those factors encourage people to be responsible? How will those factors encourage people to take measures that will in some, albeit marginal, way mitigate the effect of those horrendous crime figures which, combined with the tax, will lead to increased premiums? Any reasonable assessment of that matter is bound to conclude that those factors offer no encouragement. I flag that up to the Paymaster General in his review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that one of the problems will be that people will not insure. However, another problem, that will arise from such pressures is under insuring. People will under-insure their property and, when they want to make a claim, they will find that they are hit by the rules on insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend with his expert knowledge of such issues for pointing out that aspect. Even if people under-insure, they will attract the horrendous, swingeing tax on that insurance. It is not so much a triple whammy as a multi-faceted whammy from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have a review. However, I seriously hope that the Paymaster General will reflect on the issues that we have raised. They are not technical issues. I know that much of the clause is concerned with technical issues. I have deliberately kept away from such issues as, I think,
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
have my hon. Friends. We are dealing with the real world and with how people will be affected. Families will be making decisions, day in, day out, as a result of the tax. For no reason other than that, we demand the Government to take those issues fully into account when they impose the tax and, in particular, when they come up with their review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start my contribution by asking the Paymaster General some questions to which, hopefully, he will be able to reply with precision and clarity when he responds to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General has yet to tell the Committee the review's exact timetable—when he intends to start it and when he intends to complete it: nor has he told us its scope and nature. Will it examine the issues that have been raised by Labour members of the Committee concerning the impact of the tax on people's propensity to insure or the losses to individuals from either a complete lack of insurance or a failure to insure adequately, or will it only examine the tax's efficiency in terms of revenue that is enjoyed from it? We need more information about the review's scope and intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General was precise in his contribution on the costs of collection but less precise on the revenue that the Treasury predicts that it will obtain from the review. Referring back to the debate when the tax was first introduced, I note that it was stated that £295 million would be collected in the current financial year, and £775 million in the next one. It was suggested in the Postmaster General's contribution that he was not reaching those figures. We need to know precisely what figures the Government currently predict. If, as was suggested, those figures are lower, we should be told exactly how much lower they are. If less is being collected, we also need to know what provision is being made for money to be collected elsewhere to make good the shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An issue that concerns Labour members of the Committee is that, if there is a shortfall, the Government may have to consider either the tax's scope—whether to increase or change it in any way—or its level, at 2.5 per cent. If they do not intend to do that, is it that, with the sudden conversion to progressive taxation that the Postmaster General suggested in his initial remarks that he was moving towards, he will consider progressive taxation in some form to make up for the shortfall? The Committee has a right to know what figures are available on the amount of revenue that the Government expect to receive from the tax in the current and future financial years and what measures will be implemented to make up the shortfall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to more general issues. Opposition Members are in favour of fair taxation, but it is nonsense to suggest that IPT is a progressive tax. If poorer people are paying less, that is simply because they own less and need to insure less. That has nothing to do with a system of progressive taxation. Were the Government enthusiastic about progressive taxation, they would not consistently have misled the people of Britain for the past 16 years by reducing income tax and increasing indirect taxation so that we now have the greatest division between rich and poor that has existed since records began. Any attempt to pretend that IPT is a good or progressive tax is at best naive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
I draw the Committee's attention to some cases that have been brought to my surgery by constituents; they demonstrate the problems that face residents in inner city areas and areas with more burglary than elsewhere. One constituent, who lives in a ground-floor flat, had been burgled three times in the previous six months or so and then found that her insurance company was no longer prepared to insure her. She hunted around for alternative insurance but could not find any. She came to me as a last resort to see if I had better knowledge of the insurance industry than the brokers from whom she had sought advice. She eventually found a company to insure her but had to pay almost double the premium she had originally paid and it was on that doubled premium that she then had to pay IPT. She was hit by a double whammy—the whammy of having to pay more because insurance companies are selective about who they choose to insure, and the whammy of having to pay the tax imposed by the Government who, having got their finances in such a mess, have had to introduce a range of new taxes to ensure that they balance their budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case concerns a single parent with a 16-year-old daughter whose flat was burnt two or three weeks ago. The daughter's bedroom was completely burnt out. The daughter was preparing for her GCSE examinations and lost everything, including her school work and possessions. The mother was on income support and in my London constituency she simply could not afford the insurance premiums for her flat. I have tried to find charities to help her so that she might have a little bit of money to buy clothes for her daughter, but she will not be able to replace all the possessions that her daughter had in her room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell that story because it shows that if the review that the Paymaster General has promised does not consider more than just the efficacy of the tax, it will not show whether insurance rates in certain areas have gone up when rates in general are falling. There is also the problem of the tax itself, which may put insurance out of the reach of the poorest in our community. The broader aspects of the problem must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other Labour members of the Committee have discussed red lining, which is particularly bad in London. I have a list of certain postal districts in London, some of which are in my constituency. If an insurance company receives an application for insurance from one of those areas, that application will be referred to the head office. The local office will not consider it. Any home that is insured will be at the highest rate or higher. National figures could therefore show a drop in insurance premiums demanded by insurance companies—and reported figures have shown a slight decline in burglaries over the past year—but regional and sub-regional variations need to be studied in order to obtain a true picture of those who are hit hardest by high insurance premiums and by the tax that the Government have chosen to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Barking, there was an increase of 47 per cent, in the number of burglaries between 1989 and June 1994. That figure is surpassed only by Sutton and by Kingston upon Thames. Those areas suffered the highest increase in burglarly since 1989. There is clearly an important
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
connection between the number of burglaries and the price of insurance. To appreciate that, one must take a broader perspective than that adopted by the Government, who have considered only what occurred in the past few months, although their findings are welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, insurance can cost as much as £600 per household for contents insurance of £30,000. That is massively higher than the general figures that Conservative Members have given. Insurance costs are highest in areas where there are the highest levels of poverty. People experience the highest levels of crime, particularly of burglary, in those areas. High insurance costs are the Government's fault for two reasons: they reflect the Government's failure to tackle crime effectively, and they reflect the Government's failure to understand how a policy that is implemented in general impacts on individuals in a particular locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in responding to the debate, the Government will give a clear indication of the scope of the review and say whether it will examine the impact of concentrations of crime in areas of highest poverty and the cost of premiums to the poorest people in our community. A fairer and more progressive approach would be to build taxation policy around that better understanding of the impact of crime on insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are discussing crime-related issues, I should declare an interest as parliamentary adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales, although I do not hold a brief for that organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have imposed an unfair tax on victims of crime—who have become, disproportionately, victims of the tax. It is clear that insurance companies are raising premiums in areas of high crime and they are likely to raise even higher the premiums of someone who has been a victim of crime and has had to make several claims. Such people have become more that just victims of the Government's failure effectively to tackle crime—more than just victims of cuts in policing and cuts in criminal injuries compensation—they have now become victims of the Government's new insurance tax, which disproportionately hits the home and car insurance premiums of the poor and those who have been victims of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the Government are now prepared to tax anything, even their own failures. The Government will claim that crime is falling and that they hope that insurance premiums will fall accordingly. One of my hon. Friends suggested that the main reason why some insurance premiums have fallen is because of telesales, rather than a reduction in crime. Let us examine the issue of the reduction in crime and its impact on tax. Since 1979, crime has tripled in my constituency. In the case of burglary and car theft, it has quadrupled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is fair to say that crime has fallen by 16 per cent, in the past year. That is due to two factors. The first is the reduction in unemployment, which is especially due to attracting new industry to the area. The second is "Operation Claw" in Warwickshire, which has received some national publicity and which targets burglary in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want to claim an advantage from the relatively small fall in crime during the past year, perhaps they will also accept responsibility for the tripling of crime generally and the quadrupling of burglary and car
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
theft in my constituency since they took office. I expect that they will try to claim the benefits without acknowledging responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance premium tax is a disincentive to insure. Surely we should be doing the opposite and encouraging people to insure. We want to ensure that those who become victims of crime do not then become victims of poverty. Unless the state were to intervene, which I am sure the Government would not want, the only way to ensure that that did not happen would be if victims of crime have proper insurance. Do not we want the car driver to be insured? Is not it crucial that victims of accidents in vehicles are able to claim from someone for injury? If there is a tax that is a disincentive to do that, the Government must state clearly the logic justifying that. They should not be giving a disincentive, but doing the opposite. The disincentive to insure hits 16.5 million homes across the country. It is a burden on homes, families and those businesses that have to administer or pay the tax because it creates extra bureaucracy, although not necessarily extra cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When crime was rising, insurance premiums were also rising significantly. The new insurance premium tax has ensured that any benefits during the past year or so of slightly falling premiums have not been passed on to the consumer. During the past eight or nine years—certainly since the 1987 general election—sharp increases have occurred in the price that people have to pay for insurance. That in itself has discouraged people from taking out the insurance that we want them to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area of the west midlands, the cost of car insurance between the 1987 and 1992 general elections rose from an average of £172.50 to £268.72—a 55 per cent, increase in cash terms and a 19 or 20 per cent, increase in real terms. The average cost for home property insurance in 1987 was £85.80. By 1992, that had increased to £146.26—a 31 per cent, rise in real terms. Home contents insurance rose from £55.50 to £85.81—an 18.8 per cent. rise. That is a disincentive to insure. Not enough people will take out essential insurance. During that period, burglaries in the west midlands increased from 53,114 in 1987 to 80,247 in June 1993—a 51 per cent, increase. The increase of crime in my county was worse than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman will have to accept that Labour Members will continue to defend our constituents and to ensure that his constituents and those of other Conservative Members have a voice that tries to express their views on these matters. We shall keep repeating what we have to say and ensuring that the voice of the ordinary people in this country is heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) has already mentioned that telephone sales, in particular, were causing a small fall in premiums for household and other insurance. That is indeed the case although, as my hon. Friend also said, that fall in premiums has been offset by the increase in taxation, so people are, in effect, no better off. The main beneficiaries from the fall in premiums brought about by the take-off of telephone sales tend to be people in better-off areas. Those in poorer areas are less likely to be able to take advantage of the savings simply because they probably have less access to telephones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as increased targeting from insurance companies, coupled with the problem of some people not having access to telephones, we shall soon see an increase in differentials between those who are hurt by the tax—the poorer people and those who are more likely to be victims of crime—and those who are less likely to be victims and who are often better off. That increase in the differentials suggests that the Minister's claim that the tax is wholly progressive is not tenable. His position may well change in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not talk about the detail of schedule 5 now because we shall move on to that later, but as the clause would bring the schedule into operation, I should like to point out that the imposition of taxes such as this one requires the extension of Government powers into areas of people's lives which have not concerned the Government before. That is what the schedule is all about. It enables the Government to become involved in individual insurance arrangements in which they were previously not involved and also to look at people's bank accounts. If we are to have taxes such as this it may well
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
be that we need those powers to ensure that the taxes are properly enforced, but the schedule gives the Government more power to examine people's private lives. I had always assumed that the general thrust of Conservative philosophy was to reduce the power of the state, but it seems that each time we have to impose indirect taxes, unlike income taxes for which the Government already have much of the necessary information, the Government extend the range of information they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall highlight just one erosion of the rights of ordinary people, which is contained in paragraph 5 of schedule 5. Paragraph 5 amends section 59 and therefore restricts individuals' rights of appeal. I have always taken the view that any reduction in citizens' rights must be fully justified by the Government, and I ask the Minister to explain fully that further erosion of rights. It is not good enough to say only that paragraph 5 brings IPT into line with equivalent VAT assessments. A reduction in the rights of a citizen to obtain a review of a decision made by Customs and Excise in respect of an assessment should have a justification in its own right. I hope that the Minister will be able to justify the erosion of rights that citizens had even under last year's legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The moves toward higher taxation, the greater intrusion into people's lives and the removal of rights that were previously held are all tied up with the insurance premium tax. We must ensure that the tax is seen in its overall context. Not only does the tax do all those things, but it imposes unacceptable burdens on families. It must be seen in the context of not only higher overall taxes, but higher interest rates. It is part of a general Government philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what the philosophy is these days. The Paymaster General said that the tax was working well in practice. But it seems to me that it is not working well for the victims of crime, who are also the victims of the tax. It is not working well for business; it is an extra cost and a bureaucratic burden. It is certainly not working well for the Conservative party because despite their supposed lower-tax policy, it results in more taxes, more burdens in business and a disincentive for people to take out their own insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry that the Government are becoming positively enthusiastic about higher taxes. The Paymaster General
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
almost seemed to be enthusing when he said that it was a wholly progressive tax and that it was working well in practice. I worry that Ministers now spend so much time justifying high taxes that they are beginning to believe their own propaganda. I suspect that some of his hon. Friends on the Back Benches will have to take care lest a high-tax mentality becomes contagious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I shall be very brief because as you rightly say, most of the points that needed to be made have been made at some length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My starting point—and I stress that this is a personal view—is to say that I have no objections in principle to taxing general insurance. What is at issue is whether the tax, as currently constituted, is fair across all classes and types of insurance and within classes and types of insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A distinction should be made between necessary insurance, such as home contents and buildings insurance and motor insurance, and insurance that some people think is desirable, such as private health insurance. I see no reason why a standard percentage rate should apply to all classes of insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a long debate on fairness within different classes of insurance and reference has been made to post codes and the difficulties that people in some areas have in obtaining insurance. The right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, was trustee of a charity for which I work which provides finance and assistance to people and organisations working in inner cities. I remind the right hon. Gentleman of our debates then on how it was either impossible for people living in Liverpool 8, Handsworth or St Paul's in Bristol to obtain insurance or exorbitantly expensive for them to do so. That is relevant and should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to retread the thorny issue of whether IPT will be mildly progressive. The former Paymaster General, the right hon. Member for Northavon (Sir John Cope), said on 1 February 1994:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The family expenditure survey shows that the poorest 20 per cent, of households on average spend about £120 a year on taxable insurance. That means that their IPT would come out at about 7p a week. The richest 20 per cent, of households pay about £800 a year. Their IPT will come out at about 47p a week."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 1 February 1994; Vol. 236, c. 826.]</p></blockquote>
That is the justification for the suggestion that the tax is mildly progressive, but it does not stand well when comparing reality with the difficulties of obtaining insurance in some inner-city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware, as I am sure are most hon. Members, that averages can be misleading when trying to reconcile reality with family household expenditure. I usually use visual aids when discussing this. There is a significant difference in terms of the number of people in the poorest 20 per cent, of households who have any insurance. The denominator in terms of the proportion of households is the 20 per cent, figure and the proportion of that 20 per cent, that has any insurance in very small. The proportion of the wealthiest 20 per cent, of households which has insurance is very high. That is significant and I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would recalculate the figures on the basis of those who take out taxable

insurance. He would then discover that the figures are unlikely to be progressive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a lot this morning about the impact of crime on insurance policies, about the real concern experienced by people as a consequence of high crime in their areas and about the difficulties that they encounter trying to buy insurance. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West mentioned action that could be taken by householders to protect themselves from crime. Only 18 months ago, my distinguished predecessor, the late John Smith, inaugurated a closed circuit television project in the centre of Airdrie, one of the main towns in my constituency, since which time there has been an appreciable decline in crime. However, I am not informed by householders or shopkeepers in the centre of Airdrie of any consequential reduction in their insurance policies. Admittedly, I accept me Minister's earlier point that the tax is only now coming into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed crime in some detail this morning, but the Minister should also take into account the impact of natural disasters. I speak with some feeling on this and I think that all of us who saw the effects of floods last week have perhaps forgotten that, in early December last year, there were devastating floods in the town of Paisley, which is represented by my hon. Friends the Members for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) and for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster). This is a classic example of how the cost of insurance policies is directly related to the income of families. It is difficult to think of an area poorer than the Ferguslie park area of Paisley. It is difficult to conceive of anything more distressing than watching the toys, for which families in extreme poverty had saved, floating down the street.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister take into account in the Bill the fact that the tax has a disproportionate impact on the poorest in our society? The people in Ferguslie park made it plain that they could not afford to insure their properties. They had saved for many years to buy their household goods; in fact, many of them will have to continue to pay hire purchase for goods that had been destroyed and which were not insured. They could not afford to take out insurance prior to the implementation of the tax and now they are in an even worse position. They were in the degrading position of having to accept charity from readers of newspapers to enable them to make good the losses that they had incurred. Such people are most adversely affected by this taxation. There has always been a tradition in working-class communities of trying to afford insurance. Indeed, the Co-operative Insurance Society would not exist today were it not for the fact that many people in poorer communities were determined to take out insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make one final point to the Paymaster General. Last year, his predecessor said that long-term insurance, such as life insurance and endowment policies, would not be affected by this tax. I am deeply worried about the changes in the Government's policy on taxation and about their perceived determination to move from direct to indirect taxation. Will the hon. Gentleman give us his assurance that there will be no proposals to extend
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
the scope of the tax to life insurance? Many people who do not have a car because they cannot afford to pay car insurance or who cannot afford house contents insurance or structural insurance will be determined, somehow or other, to pay for life insurance. I am deeply worried that such people may be affected by an extension of the scope of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of the scope and rate of the tax, I dealt with the point in reply to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and there is nothing further that I can add. However, I say to Opposition Members that if they are worried about the future rate of the tax, and if they are as sure as they profess to be that there will be a Labour Government some time next century, they should take the matter up with their Friends on the Opposition Front Bench. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central was noticeably reticent about his future plans on taxation and we all know that to fund the Opposition's expenditure promises and ambitions there will have to be tax increases. That is one of the reasons why I did not refer in my opening remarks to the rates in other European Union countries—I thought that it might give the Opposition ideas about the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Denmark has an insurance tax of up to 50 per cent. In Italy the top rate is over 21 per cent, and even in Germany the tax is generally at 12 per cent. We did not introduce the tax because of any need or desire to harmonise, or even move modestly in the direction of rates overseas, we did it on its own merits. However, the Labour party's new-found love affair with the European Union could tempt them towards such rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened on the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South to say that if he wishes to challenge the published figures to which I referred, which were based on the family expenditure survey, he must stop making generalised assertions and put forward his own analysis and figures. He talked of the tax as a multi-faceted whammy, for which he should get full marks for hyperbole, but that does not help us to analyse where the tax is falling and who will pay it. We have shown in advance, as my predecessor did, how the tax falls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking was in a muddle not only about the tax, but about who was to reply to the debate because she kept referring to the Postmaster General. I believe that the last Postmaster General was John Stonehouse, who went for a swim, or at least pretended to have done. He is late and lamented, but I am actually the Paymaster General and I am replying in that capacity. Perhaps the hon. Lady thought that the debate was about insurance stamps or something, but my responsibilities are for indirect taxation and I shall thus refer to her substantive point about the review of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confirm to her that, as is common for any new tax, Customs and Excise will conduct an internal review of the tax later in the year to examine in detail how it was implemented, what lessons can be learnt and what changes, if any, need to be made to achieve the desired results as laid down by Parliament in last year's Finance Act. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West pointed out earlier that the matter has been extensively debated, Parliament has made known its intentions and it is now up to the Customs and Excise, with the changes put forward in the current Bill to give effect to those intentions. The review will, of course, continue to ease the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
administrative burden on insurers whenever that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax has been in place for only four months, so it is difficult to be precise about revenue from a full year, but I have referred to a number of factors which could give a lower nominal yield than originally estimated. Lower inflation for example, tends to bring a lower nominal yield from most taxes. There is also a pressure on premiums caused by increased competition due to the insurance industry, which is cyclical in nature, having turned down. In addition, several adjustments to the tax were made during its implementation which tend to reduce the yield. Parliament will, of course, be given the figures in due course when the picture finally emerges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North complained that Customs and Excise was being given the necessary powers to implement and work the tax. The Labour party has made the point that any taxes that we have to have must be properly enforced, avoidance must be spotted and dealt with and evasion must be stamped out. Therefore, the necessary powers are essential. I realise that we will deal with that in more detail when we debate the schedule, but I cannot accept that generalised criticism of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one or two points. We have had a comprehensive debate and I shall only repeat those that warrant repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General spoke about taxation. The Conservative party is in no position to lecture anyone about plans for increasing taxes. This Government have introduced more taxes than any Government in modern history and are in no position to accuse anyone else of doing that. At the last election, we said what we were going to do; we lost. The Government did not say what they were going to do. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's point has no strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackpool, South mentioned the equalisation of reserves in the Insurance Companies (Reserves) Bill. That measure would substantially help the British insurance industry. I have made that point during the proceedings of every Finance Bill in this Parliament and I have made it clear that we would support the Government if they were to introduce such a Bill. But they have chosen to do that through a private Member's Bill, which has become bogged down in the lottery of the private Member's Bill procedure. If the Government take up that Bill and the Bill to give second signatories in building societies rights to participate in payments that might be made following a takeover—the Building Societies (Joint Account Holders) Bill—and put them through in Government time, we will co-operate fully and nod them through in a few hours. There is no difficulty in doing that. It is not correct to say that the Bill was talked out. It came up at 2.30 pm, when it was objected to. I have a great deal of sympathy for people to whom that happens because it happened to me when I introduced a non-political, non-partisan measure in the previous Parliament, which was objected to by a Conservative Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at 
	<i>Hansard</i> for the day concerned, he will understand that it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can all study 
	<i>Hansard</i> and see who reads from telephone directories and so on. That Bill should not have been in that position in the first place. If the Government take up that Bill, we will back it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Postal code areas were mentioned by several of my colleagues. There is no doubt that some people find it difficult to obtain insurance. I am sorry that the Paymaster General at no point dealt with the social consequences of the Government's fiscal policy. Conservative Members have not done that for 16 years. Although some of the more thoughtful ones are doing that now, the hon. Gentleman is clearly not in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people report the crime of housebreaking because they have to do so for insurance purposes. It follows that if they do not have insurance, there is no point in reporting the crime. In some parts of the country—I know people who have experienced this in London—several days elapse after a crime is reported before a police officer comes round to examine it. That happened to one of our colleagues. I wonder what impact that lack of insurance is having on crime reporting and, therefore, the apparent rates of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the Paymaster General's assertion that the tax is mildly progressive. He said that at the lower income levels it would mean an extra 7p a week, which would rise to 46p a week at the higher income levels. If one happens to be the chief executive of British Telecom earning £600,000 a year, I am sure that the extra 46p a week must be a cause of great concern in the weekly budget. If one is earning £56 a week or less, 7p is a significant deposition. That shows how the Government have lost touch with reality. It is high time that they had a long spell in opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 189, line 42, leave out "the Commissioners think".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an extensive debate this morning on the principle behind the tax. Schedule 5 provides the information necessary to implement it. The schedule covers several matters, in particular the option to establish a register, the criteria for doing that and the type of information that will be kept on it. Amendment No. 74 is designed to clarify that position. At present, the Bill refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such information as the Commissioners think is required".</p></blockquote>
Surely the commissioners either know or do not know the information that they require in order to maintain a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
register to enforce a tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday 31 January, 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> carried an article under the headline:
	<br><blockquote><p>"VAT inspectors do not understand laws they enforce' ".</p></blockquote>
I have some sympathy with the inspectors' plight. The article started:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some VAT inspectors have difficulties understanding the laws they are supposed to enforce, a leaked Customs and Excise document has claimed."</p></blockquote>
That is because the laws are so complex. Schedule 5 contains a series of proposals dealing with tax collection and we are trying to help the Government to tighten up the system and simply say that the information on the register must be the information that the commissioners require to enforce the collection of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Paymaster General explain why such a wide-ranging option was left to the commissioners? What difference is there between the type of information that the commissioners are likely to think is appropriate and what information is appropriate? On what basis would the register be established? What criteria would be used in deciding what information should be kept on the register? What will trigger the establishment of the register, because establishment is optional? What information does the Paymaster General envisage the commissioners will require in order to implement schedule 5?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a poor amendment and I urge the Committee to reject it because it would remove the ability of the Customs and Excise commissioners to exercise their judgment in determining what information is contained on the IPT register. Someone has to decide what information is required and it is clearly right that that should be the commissioners, because under the Finance Act 1994 the commissioners are given the job of administering the tax. Section 48(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tax shall be under the care and management of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise."</p></blockquote>
It is obviously wise that they should be given that discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that those who tabled amendment No. 74 might have confused schedule 5(3) with schedule 5(4), which we may consider next and which determines what information insurers are required to provide to Customs and Excise. Paragraph 4 touches on powers that should be under Parliament's control and that is why it allows for regulations, which must pass through this House, to specify when and how insurers should notify Customs and Excise of changes to their circumstances and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3, which is the subject of the amendment, does not extract information from insurers; it merely specifies the form of the register itself. Therefore, the amendment is inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause maintains the existing structure of income tax rates and slightly widens the lower band. The Government thereby seek to maintain the illusion—indeed, the deceit—that they are a tax-cutting Government and not a tax-raising one. Like the long-suffering British people whom we represent and whose concerns we reflect, we know the truth. Conservative Members promised that theirs would be a tax-cutting Government, but they have put taxes up by a record amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his introduction to the 1992 Conservative general election manifesto, the Prime Minister said that he believed in low taxes, but we know that he practises high and increasing taxes. Although he promised tax cuts year on year, the people have experienced tax increases year on year. The people might once have trusted the Conservative party on tax, but they will never do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year has been no exception to the pattern of year-on-year tax increases. While the Chancellor made much in his Budget speech of the largesse that he claimed to be distributing to the British people, his actions and the consequences of the Bill tell the opposite. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, we can at last begin to benefit from our steady return to healthy public finances. This means that I can fully index the personal allowance, the threshold for higher rate tax, and the income limit for the age-related allowance.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I have been able to provide some additional help in two important areas. First, I want to do a little bit more for pensioners. I propose to increase the age-related personal allowance by more than indexation. The allowances for everyone aged 65 and over will be increased by £430. Nearly 3 million pensioners will gain from this, at a cost of £200 million in a full year.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Secondly, I also propose to widen the 20p lower band to £3,200. That increase is twice the amount necessary for indexation for inflation."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 29 November 1994; Vol. 250, 
	<i>c.</i> 1102.]</p></blockquote>
On hearing all that, the British public might believe that a typical family would be paying less income tax from April and that the Chancellor was lightening the tax burden. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let us consider a typical family, with one person in work, on average earnings of £19,500, with two children and a £30,000 mortgage. With the April 1995 tax changes, that family would not be better off; they would not, as the Chancellor said, benefit from
	<br><blockquote><p>"our steady return to healthy public finances".</p></blockquote>
That family will be worse off, because of income tax changes, to the tune of £219.10 a year. Clause 29(2) extends the 20p band to £3,200. How will that help? When the Chancellor said that he was increasing the band by more than twice the amount that was necessary for indexation, it sounded like a big benefit. However, it raised the lower rate limit by £100 more than would have occurred by the statutory indexing to the retail prices index, which is worth just £5 per year to our typical family. That is some testimony to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"steady return to healthy public finances".</p></blockquote>
Instead the Government have dug the country into a mess, which they have yet to extract us from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What else will the typical family get from the income tax changes in April? They will suffer the very real effects of the freezing for another year of the married couple's allowance, which is restricted to 15 per cent. That is important in the calculation of the income tax that people pay. The bad news for Conservative Members is that the electorate have now rumbled them. They know what is
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
going on. The letters that are tumbling through people's letterboxes telling them of their new tax codes are awakening them in no uncertain terms to the high tax costs of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from a couple of the many letters that Labour Members have received on that subject. I shall not divulge the identity of the correspondents; if people write to Members of Parliament they have the right not to have their tax affairs, or their names, emblazoned all over
