	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. From informal discussions with members of the Committee, I understand that while we could have a seven and a half hour debate on the five sets of regulations, the majority of hon. Members wish to proceed more rapidly so that we can attend education questions in the House in an hour and a half—although I am sure that you would welcome the chance to remain in the Chair for seven and a half hours, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will come into force on 1 April 1999 and will apply to the admissions to primary and secondary schools from September 2000. They give effect to the Government's code of practice on school admissions. Statutory instruments Nos. 124 and 126 relate to the Greenwich judgment, which appears in paragraph 5.4 on page 9 of the code. No. 124 also relates to the appointment and role of adjudicators, which is covered in paragraphs 4.9 to 4.12 of the code, while No. 258 refers to partial selection and aptitude—a mysterious concept that has not yet been well defined—which are covered on pages 10 and 11 of the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), who will no doubt add to and improve on my remarks, I will explain why we do not support the regulations or the parts of the code of practice to which they give effect. The regulations give rise to some measures that we fundamentally oppose in principle and to others that demonstrate the Government's confusion, which means that they could create significant problems in our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
All members of the Committee stage of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 agreed that the school admission arrangements should be, in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, simple, clear, fair and open. Similar words are now contained in the code of practice. I hope to demonstrate that the regulations do not meet those basic criteria. The admission arrangements are not simple, clear, fair or—because of their complexity—open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While on the question of openness, will the Minister confirm—indeed, I hope that she will deny it—that what Baroness Blackstone said in another place was correct? On 11 March in column 440 of the 
	<i>Official Report,</i> she said that the code of practice on appeals, which is a vital part of admission policy, is to be consulted upon only during the Easter break.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When in opposition, the Government were highly critical of the Conservative Government's consulting on education matters during the holidays. Yet I understand that consultation is to take place during the Easter holiday, that the final version of the appeals procedure will come before Parliament in June and that it will be implemented in September. That is cutting it very fine. The orders will come into force on 1 April, yet we are told that the other side of the coin, the appeals procedure, is badly delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note with interest that in press notice 63/99, issued on 5 February, the Minister said that for the first time, parents would be able to appeal to fully independent appeals panels if their preferences had not been met. However, although I agree with what the hon. Lady wants, no consultation has been held on the appeals procedure. It seems rather odd that she should announce what will happen before the consultation has taken place. She certainly appears to have jumped the gun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some specific points to make about the regulations. I start with statutory instruments Nos. 124 and 126, which contain the effects of the Greenwich judgment. Members of the Committee will remember that that judgment ruled that applications made by parents who live outside the LEA area for their children to attend an authority's schools must the considered equally with applications made by those who live within the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has caused a great deal of anger and angst among the many parents who found that their children could not be placed at their own LEA's schools because children from outside the area had taken their places. That problem is particularly marked in schools that are selective or partially selective, because the level of competition is higher. It effectively enlarges the school's catchment area, and makes it more difficult for local parents to get their children into a local school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argued during the passage of the School Standards and Framework Bill that it would be more appropriate to give the LEA responsibility for admission arrangements for all the state schools within its area. We disagree with the Government's intention to support the Greenwich judgment. The regulations allow that ruling to continue without giving us the chance to change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a couple of examples. The Tiffin boys' school in Kingston-upon-Thames had an entrance year of 69 pupils from within the borough and 80 pupils from outside, and the Tiffin girls' school took 55 girls from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
borough and 70 from outside. It is almost unbelievable that some selective schools in the Sutton LEA area have pupils who travel daily from Brighton. I ask the Committee to think of the distances involved, because it will be relevant later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the effects of the Greenwich judgment. We want legislation to overturn that judgment; unfortunately, the regulations do not do so. It will now be possible, subject to consultation, for admission authorities to draw any boundary they like, with one exception. They will not be allowed to draw the boundary of the LEA itself. That is bizarre, especially in the light of paragraphs (4) and (5) of regulation 5 of the Education (Determination of Admission Arrangements) Regulations. Given that the Government intend to continue to support the Greenwich judgment, it is understandable that the regulations require schools whose governing bodies will be their own admission authority to consult their own and neighbouring LEAs. However, paragraphs (4) and (5) place distance limits on the requirements, which, as the Minister knows, are defined in terms of what is called in paragraph (5) the "radial area".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limits that the Government have imposed are such that, given the distances involved in cases such as that which I described of Sutton schools and Brighton, it is quite possible that such schools will not have to consult people in the area from which they have traditionally drawn pupils, and continue to do so, as is the case in Sutton. The Minister shakes her head; I look forward to her explanation. I am more than happy to be told by the Minister that I have misread paragraphs (4) and (5) of regulation 5, but that is my interpretation and that of others who have examined those regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (Relevant Areas for Consultation on Admission Arrangements) Regulations give effect to the appointment of adjudicators. It is slightly odd that the chief adjudicator and several other adjudicators have already been appointed. The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said last night that a former Member of the House, Mr. Robin Squire, who used to serve frequently on Committees such as this, has been appointed. We are opposed to adjudicators, but if they must be appointed, I welcome Robin Squire's appointment, and am sure that he will do an excellent job. However, what job will he do? Adjudicators have been appointed despite the fact that the regulations that describe their job have not yet been approved by Parliament. How can the Government have appointed people when we have not yet agreed what they should do? That is the purpose of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully. He is right to welcome the appointment of the former Member for Hornchurch, Mr. Robin Squire. He is also right to point out that it is yet another example of the Government's putting the cart before the horse, and trying to bypass the House of Commons and its Committees by making appointments, albeit welcome ones such as this, before the Committee has discussed the regulations. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is an example of the Government's misuse of power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the first time that there has been a misuse of power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins). My hon. Friend makes the point that it is not the first time that there has been misuse of power in this place. I hope that the Minister will explain how appointments can be made without job descriptions having been agreed by the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, we are opposed to the appointment of adjudicators who are not democratically elected and are unaccountable to the people whom they supposedly serve. In most cases, there is no right of appeal against adjudicators' determinations. The Government did not think that procedure to be necessary in Wales where there will be no adjudicators, and there will be opportunities to appeal to the Secretary of State on admissions matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have said that there is no right of appeal in most cases. Part III of statutory instrument No. 125 provides for exceptions to the rule about appeals on the adjudicators' decisions. Again, I ask the Minister to explain that rather bizarre provision. Paragraph 7(1) of those regulations makes it clear that the adjudicator must refer to the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"an objection … about any criterion for admission … relating to a person's religion, religious denomination or religious practice."</p></blockquote>
The real oddity is that objections to admissions on the grounds of race or gender will be dealt with by the adjudicator without a reference to the Secretary of State and without a right of appeal. Will the Minister explain why religious matters, which are important, relating to admissions should be dealt with by the Secretary of State, but equally important issues of race and gender should not? The Secretary of State can intervene in an issue relating to an orthodox Jew, but not in one relating to an atheist Jew. That is bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, matters of religion lead to another oddity that the Minister should explain. She will recall that in opposition the present Secretary of State for Education and Employment said, "Watch my lips—no selection by interview or examination". Those were his precise words yet, under the code of practice, interviews on religious commitment can form part of the admission procedure for Church schools. That is extremely odd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worry is that allowing such interviews to continue produces the danger that all sorts of other areas might be strayed into—for example, the social standing of the parents, the ability of child and so on. I do not understand why Ministers think it necessary to go back on what they said before the election. After all, the Government say that the purpose of the interview is to obtain information about religious commitment, but evidence about that can be obtained without the need for an interview to take place. Information on baptism, confirmation, church attendance and so on can all be obtained by other means— for example, in writing from the local vicar or priest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain why that provision is necessary, especially given that during the consultation on the regulations the Church authorities made it clear that they had no particular desire for such a provision to be in the regulations. I have recently asked the Church of England Board of Education for its view on that matter. One of its officials told me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Throughout the passage of the Bill, we did not see a particular need for interviews, and felt it could go. We would have been content to see it disappear."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
So why do the regulations contain that provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Education (Aptitude for Particular Subjects) Regulations (S.I. 1999, No. 258). The Committee will be delighted to know that I do not intend to rehearse in detail the Liberal Democrat views on selection. I hope that those who were present will agree that those views were well aired during the consideration in Committee of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. In summary, we agree with what the Secretary of State for Education and Employment said before the previous general election. I have quoted him saying that there would be no selection. The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and the statutory instruments will allow selection not only to continue but to expand under the guise of selection by aptitude. That will create a raft of problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another part of the admission procedure gives priority to the siblings of children who are currently at the school. Children from outside the area, who may not necessarily have particularly high ability, attend the school because they are the siblings of children who already attend the school because of its selection procedures. We gave examples showing how the sibling rule means that more and more children come from outside the local area, resulting in fewer and fewer opportunities for local children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We Liberal Democrats object to the statutory instruments in principle. I know that the Minister for School Standards frequently spoke against selection before the previous general election, but if she has now changed her mind and done a U-turn and is determined to allow selection by aptitude to take place, why has she come up with such a bizarre list as that contained in statutory instrument No. 258? Why is there selection for those subjects but not for science, especially when we are hoping to have specialist schools for science? Why has the Minister omitted science from the list when she wants to have schools that specialise in that subject? That makes no sense, and it is another example of the Government not thinking the matter through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a further bizarre aspect to the list? I welcome the fact that the Government have included sport, but, at the same time, they have removed sport from the compulsory element of the national curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman helps me in the sense that there are a number of oddities in the statutory instruments, for which we need explanations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory instrument No. 126, which we mentioned earlier, refers to the role of the adjudicator on the matter of selection. Parents can complain to the adjudicator about existing partial selection, and he can make decisions on those complaints. However, he will not be allowed to make decisions on the introduction of new partial selection. People in a local area cannot object to the extension of partial selection. Will the Minister explanation why not? Why is it that local people can object to, and succeed in overturning, existing partial selection but have no say in its extension?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
There is yet another oddity in relation to selection. I said that parents can complain about existing partial selection, but the orders make it clear that they can complain on only a limited number of issues. They cannot complain because they are opposed to selection in principle, although the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 said that people would be allowed to do so. The orders show that someone can object on very limited grounds, such as when there is genuine specialisation in a school or when the proposed test is one of aptitude rather than ability, which is not allowed. Nevertheless, parents can complain about existing partial selection, but which parents in which area? Again, there is confusion in the Government's mind. The section on the admission procedure in SI 124 states that the people who could be consulted are those in the relevant area, but that, for schools that are their own admission authorities, there is an additional area outside the radial area in which people could be consulted. However, those who can object to partial selection will be from a different area. Why is there that difference? If a school that is acting as its own admission authority protests about the admission arrangements generally under the regulations, people in one area could be consulted, but if the protest is about partial selection only people in the relevant area could be consulted, and for some reason those in the radial area would be missed out. I hope that the Minister will explain why that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought to point out that there are many issues in the regulations with which the Liberal Democrats disagree in principle, and that there is much confusion in them that we believe will create complexity and uncertainty. That confusion will demonstrate that the regulations do not meet the criteria about which my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough spoke.

There are other issues that I would dearly love to discuss, and I shall take an example from the code. Why do some city technology colleges that must be part of the forums have to do nothing about admission arrangements? It seems bizarre that they can be part of them and yet have no requirement to do anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally bizarre that the Government have firmed up the need for people to work together and for the different admission authorities to have a co-ordinated arrangement. However, they are only encouraged to have one. If we are to make life easy for parents, surely the Government ought to have insisted on that.

I hope that I have made it clear why we are unhappy with the statutory instruments and the code of practice that arises from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are five different regulations and, as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has made clear, it is necessary to make some reference to the code of practice on school admissions while considering them. I note that there will be a prayer against the code, and I hope that there will be an opportunity to have a proper and full discussion about the code itself, as there are many issues in it that it is important to scrutinise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
A chapter of the code of practice, "Making Admissions Easier for Parents", ties in with the debate that we had in the Standing Committee that considered the School Standards and Framework Bill. The hon. Member for Bath referred in his opening remarks to the comments of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresboroguh on the need for admission arrangements to be simple, clear, fair and open. At the time, the Government appeared to accept those needs, hence why they have put the reference to making admissions easier for parents into the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, any parent who tied to find out about the procedures and rules that govern admission arrangements would be faced with 11 sections in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Those cover 11 pages of the Act. The code of practice is a further 29 pages. There are five regulations of 25 further pages, let alone seven pages of explanatory notes. In addition to those regulations, on a quick look through the five regulations before us, at least four other statutory instruments must be consulted by anyone who wants seriously to consider the arrangements before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all that is simplicity and clarity, I hate to think what the Government would produce if they were writing a complex document. The arrangements are not simple or clear; they are difficult. Many contradictions are apparent within the regulations and the code, and relating to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. It is important that parents know and understand the arrangements. I am sure that every member of the Committee receives, as I do, comments and complaints from parents who find that they are unable to get their children into the local school. They often do not understand admission arrangements, and it is important that they do. It is important also that local authorities and schools can help parents with them. I fear that the procedures within the regulations will not help that process. They are incredibly complex, and give rise to many significant questions about how they will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have concerns about the role of the adjudicator. Handily, shortly before the Committee sat, the Government announced that the former hon. Member for Hornchurch, Mr. Robin Squire, had been appointed as an adjudicator. Notwithstanding the qualities of any individual appointed as an adjudicator, we opposed the role of the adjudicator during debate on the measure that became the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. We are concerned about someone coming in from outside the area in which admission arrangements are under debate, being appointed and taking written evidence from the parties to determine those local arrangements. It is no comment on the qualities of the individuals concerned, but adjudicators will be unelected, yet will take final decisions about admission arrangements in local areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was made clear by the hon. Member for Bath and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath in his intervention, the Government are deciding which individuals will be adjudicators before the role has been clearly set out and the statutory instruments have been debated—before we have had an opportunity to ask questions and raise issues. Once again, the Government are making assumptions about Parliament and ignoring the process of due scrutiny of legislation. They are putting the cart before the horse, and effectively saying that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
have no interest in what Parliament has to say on the matter. They are happy to go ahead without proper parliamentary scrutiny, which is Parliament's right, and is important if we are to ensure good government and good legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem strange to most people that part of the arrangements are being put in place without the appeals procedure, so that parents cannot see how that will operate. As we understand it, consultation will take place on that during the Easter recess, and presumably the arrangements will be brought before the House of Commons some time thereafter—possibly in May or June. Arrangements for admissions in 2001 must be completed before July of this year. [

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, the Government are not introducing the whole package of procedure and it is not being debated by Parliament. Only part of the admission arrangements package is being introduced. It will be operated by local authorities, which will have to start the procedure to ensure that the year 2001 arrangements are in place by July 1999, as specified in the regulations. The appeals procedure, which is the other aspect of the matter, is not fully in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to specific details. Statutory instrument No. 124 deals with relevant area for consultation, and raises many issues. When I started reading it, I referred back to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and to what it stated that the regulations would do. The regulations do not deal with consultation on admission arrangements, but provide for consultation on proposals for determining and consulting on the relevant area and on admission arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations introduce yet another bureaucratic process. Local authorities will consult all the various bodies that are involved in full consultation on admission arrangements. First, however, they will consult them on their plans for how to go about deciding what the area and admission arrangements are. As I understand the regulations, they will then have to go back to those bodies when they determine the area and admission arrangements. Will the Minister clarify whether that determination requires the same process of consultation that is required for the proposals on how to determine the relevant area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Regulation 5 of statutory instrument No. 124 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each education authority shall draw up proposals for determining the relevant area or relevant areas for consultation."</p></blockquote>
Various authorities will be consulted about the proposals, as set out in regulation 6 of that instrument, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"every neighbouring education authority … every other admission authority for a local school",</p></blockquote>
and so on. It goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The education authority may also consult any other person or body they think fit."</p></blockquote>
The provisions relate only to proposals for determining the relevant area, and not to consultation on the area itself or on its admission arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 7 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Following consultation, the education authority shall determine the relevant area or relevant areas for consultation by the admission authorities for the local schools."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to refer back to regulation 5, and to state how the determination shall take place. Will the Minister confirm that that determination will itself be subject to consultation? On first reading—or at least on more readings and on looking back and forth—the regulations appear to provide that a process of consultation will occur on how to determine the area, and then the authority will determine it. Surely we should ensure proper and full consultation on what the area should be rather than on how the authority will decide it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the position of Wales is different from that of England in statutory instrument No. 124, because references to the adjudicator will not apply in Wales, where they will be made to the Secretary of State. During debate of the Bill that became the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, Opposition Members wanted to ensure a right of appeal to and determination by the Secretary of State, and not just by the adjudicator, who is appointed by the Government and who, as I said, is not an elected representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised at the comments of the hon. Member for Bath on the Greenwich judgment, to which the code refers and the consultation arrangements in the regulations apply, or on selective schools. What became clear in debates on what was to be the School Standards and Framework Act 1998—particularly in relation to the Greenwich judgment, which widens parental choice—was the Liberal Democrats' opposition to ensuring that parents have choice in these matters: choice of the sort of schools to which they want their children to go, and choice of the area in which those schools are situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, there is confusion in the order about exactly what the authority can consult on. Paragraph 9 sets out the adjudicator's role and provides that the adjudicator can, in his determination of the position, decide that the relevant area shall be a different relevant area from the one that the local education authority has determined. It is not clear what ability there is for anyone to comment
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
on or object to that. My reading of the provisions is that once an adjudicator has taken a decision, an objection cannot be made to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, a local education authority will go through the various processes, determine the relevant area and go to the adjudicator, who will then invite representations from the various parties specified in the order and determine the relevant area, either by confirming the LEA's decision or by determining that some other area shall be the relevant area. There does not appear to be any consultation or discussion about that other relevant area. An adjudicator can merely say, "I have looked at what the LEA is saying and I don't think that it is right. I say that it shall be area X." I should be grateful for clarification on that from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory instrument No. 125 raises the issue of parental objections—perhaps causing some surprises for those of us who served on the Committee examining what is now the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. That Act refers to the right of parents to object, but statutory instrument No. 125 provides that the right of a parent to object is not a right for an individual parent—there must be 10 parents who have an objection on the same issue. Furthermore, parents can object only on the issue of pre-existing selection or the pre-existing determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Conservative Members support the concept of selection, but it seems strange that parents can object only to pre-existing arrangements when the purpose of the regulations is to set up admission arrangements for the future. I think that the Minister said that there would be no new selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says no new selection by ability. However, selection is permitted—we shall debate the statutory instrument dealing with aptitude later. I can see that the Government Whip, having sat through many many such debates on the School Standards and Framework Bill in Standing Committee, is looking forward to that with excitement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although according to the Government there is to be no new selection by ability, selection by aptitude will be permitted. I should be grateful for clarification on parental ability to object in that matter. The regulations refer to selection arrangements by either ability or by aptitude. If the Minister says that the pre-existing arrangements that can be objected to by a parent relate only to selection by ability, we would oppose that. It raises a real question about what the Government are saying about parental choice and parents' ability to object to particular arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7 in part III of statutory instrument No. 125 requires the adjudicator to refer objections in relation to criteria for admission on religious grounds to the Secretary of State. I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that it seems a little strange that that is the only situation in which the adjudicator not can but shall refer objections to the Secretary of State. The adjudicator is being given a lot of power to determine matters relating to admission arrangements except in terms of criteria that relate to religious denomination or practice, in which case the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
matter has to go to the Secretary of State. I suppose that that is what one might expect from a Government who are led by a Prime Minister who has made generous use of the current arrangements of parental choice in religious schools to give his children the benefit of the rights of parental choice that his Government are attempting through the regulations to deny to other parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 7 of statutory instrument No. 125 raises a question about the future of church schools. Will the Minister explain in exactly what circumstances the Government would expect the Secretary of State to uphold an objection that has been made because of admission arrangements on a religious denomination criterion? If the Minister is going to say that the Secretary of State would have the ability to say that a church school, for example, could not apply certain criteria for admission of pupils, we should be quite clear about the matter at this stage. It is ominous that only church schools are referred to in this way in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interviews are allowed purely to determine whether the parents and child are actually practising in the religion, or denomination of religion, to which the school's ethos pertains. The headmaster of the London Oratory school— the school that the Prime Minister's sons attend, and with which he presumably had full interviews to ensure that they could attend—has commented that the way in which the Government are introducing changes to the interviews for religious schools means that the ethos of his school could change. He will no longer be able to conduct interviews on the basis that he has adopted in the past— presumably, the basis on which the Prime Minister went through the interview process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory instrument No. 126 involves an issue, which I should like the Minister to clarify, about consultation by the admission authority of schools' admission authorities. Regulation 4 states that for the purposes of consultation on admission arrangements for primary schools, the admission authority may consult only
	<br><blockquote><p>"other schools in the relevant area which are primary schools."</p></blockquote>
Would that definition of primary schools include the nursery schools in the area that are maintained by the local authority? It could be argued that admission arrangements for primary schools should also be considered by some of the secondary schools. Issues may be involved about children passing from a primary school to a secondary school that secondary schools would want to be able to consider and consult on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory instrument No. 258 covers aptitude. The hon. Member for Bath and my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath have referred to the list of subjects on which it is possible for a school to select by aptitude. The hon. Member for Bath mentioned science. That particularly interested me, because yesterday afternoon I attended a presentation and reception in the House of Commons by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Baroness Blackstone made a speech in which she made it clear that she believes that science in general, and chemistry in particular, are very important subjects, and that we must ensure high standards of science education in this country. It seems a little strange for a Minister to be talking about the importance of science while the Government are not allowing the subject of science to be included in terms of specialist schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
We have difficulty with the regulations on aptitude, as the Minister knows. Long and hard debates took place in the Standing Committee that considered the School Standards and Framework Bill on the differences between aptitude and ability. None of the Ministers was able to come up with a satisfactory distinction to justify the Government's stance. they have set their face against selection by ability. They say that it is all very well if someone happens to be good at a modern foreign language or the performing arts, but that someone who is good at a range of academic or other subjects cannot be picked by a school, by interview or other selection procedure, on the basis of that overall ability. That is a retrograde step. Schools' power to select by ability as well as aptitude is important for the maintenance of academic standards and to ensure diversity of provision for parents to choose from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my contribution, I deliberately did not raise the issue of aptitude in any detail. I was rather looking forward to the hon. Lady saying more about it. Has she read the code of practice as well as the legislation? If so, does she agree that it is very odd that if so much emphasis is placed on selection by aptitude, the code should state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The legislation does not provide a definition of the term 'aptitude'"?</p></blockquote>
The only explanation is provided at paragraph 5.16, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A test for aptitude must test for the subject aptitude concerned and not test for ability or any other aptitude."</p></blockquote>
That is it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for his intervention. The explanations are as clear as mud. The Government do not know the difference between ability and aptitude. They are playing with words to try to accord with their dogmatic opposition to selection, while accepting the benefit that many schools have derived from specialisation. In a desperate attempt to put a stop to grammar schools but allow specialist schools, the Government have come up with the gobbledygook of paragraph 5.16 of the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The degree of clarity in what the hon. Member for Bath quoted is characteristic of that in the regulations. They are complicated and do not make the procedures easier. The Government are presenting them to us without any clarity about the appeals regulations, which are important.

Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Bath, I have enormous sympathy with the Minister and indeed with any Government who try to prescribe admission

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
procedures for the nation's schools. The regulations would be imperfect whoever came up with them, and any code of practice on admissions would inevitably be flawed from one or another perspective. Schools, parents, pupils, local education authorities, the Government and Opposition parties all have their own views about admission arrangements. Those of us who worked for long hours on the School Standards and Framework Bill hoped that eventually the code of practice and statutory instruments that followed would be as simple as possible. That is what we were promised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bath and the hon. Member for Maidenhead have commented that simplicity, clarity, fairness and objectivity were criteria that the whole Committee and, presumably, the whole House would have agreed to. If these are simple, clear and objective regulations, heaven help us with those that are complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been pointed out a couple of times that the code of practice for appeal will not appear until all the regulations have been agreed. That is wrong in principle. The code of practice ought to have been presented at least simultaneously to allow us to put all the pieces of the jigsaw together and to debate them at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice and the statutory instruments simply perpetuate one of the great pretences of the previous Government and this Government—that parents have choice. In reality, they do not, they never have had and, under these regulations, they never will have. What we are doing is giving schools choice and ensuring that they have more choice. The regulations extend their power, effectively taking it from parents and, more importantly as regards Government policy, lessening the power of LEAs and rendering them little more than clearing houses for different admission systems in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a basic conflict that cannot be resolved here. As my noble Friend Earl Russell said in the other place, there is a conflict between a universal system of education, which we Liberal Democrats firmly believe in and want made open and available to all, and a market system which the previous Government—to be fair to them—openly preferred but which the Government are undecided about. This conflict cannot be resolved in regulations, which is the principle reason why we have such a difficult proposition before us now and schools, local authorities and parents will have difficult choices in future as they try to make the regulations work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats' position is clear. We believe in a comprehensive system and that within it there should be a presumption in favour of local choice, with children attending their local schools. We also believe strongly in the Government's agenda to make all schools good schools, and that the choice of a local school should be the parents' first choice. We share that objective. We also believe that parents have a place within the system and that they should be accommodated within those two principles—a comprehensive system of education and good local choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
If that had come about, we would have a simple code of practice that was clear, fair and objective. We had dearly hoped that the Government, given their objective of "education, education, education", would introduce such a system, but they did not. Instead, we have a system that meets neither our objectives, nor the Opposition's: we do not have a pure market system either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I questioned in the Standing Committee of the Schools Standards and Framework Bill why foundation schools had their own admission arrangements while community schools did not, because that is nonsense. I did not argue from a position of wanting all schools to have admission arrangements, but that is what we now have. Every school in the land can now have its own arrangements. While that may at the outset seem fair, and it may appear relatively logical not to have one group of schools with its own admission arrangements if the other is without them, what we have got is an opportunity for huge confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the exchange between Baroness Blatch and Baroness Blackstone in the other place in which Lady Blatch made it clear that schools will have to interpret the regulations if they become admission authorities in their own right. Baroness Blackstone made it clear, as 
	<i>Hansard</i> records, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the arrangements are not for schools as a whole; they are for admission authorities; that means LEAS and a small minority of schools, those that are grant-maintained and will become foundations and voluntary aided schools."—
	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 439.]</p></blockquote>
If areas such as Kent continue the selective system— with grammar schools and secondary-moderns—it is inconceivable that individual admission arrangements will apply in every grammar school, but not in the rest of the schools. In areas where there are many foundation schools, previously grant-maintained schools and many grammar schools, we will see a host of different schools making their own admission arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister stands up to contradict me, I accept that the LEA will have a role—of co-ordinating the system and pulling it together. In reality, though, I can envisage challenges in the courts when a school wants its own admission arrangements, banding arrangements and an element of selection by aptitude, which could bring it into conflict with the LEA and the adjudicator. This is a dog's breakfast and will be complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation No. 251 will also require individual schools with their own admission arrangements to devote significant resources to meeting the requirements of the code. In my local authority of north Yorkshire, the grammar schools in Skipton and Ripon draw on a vast area. Ermysted's grammar school in Skipton and the Skipton girls' high school take students from at least three LEAs—Bradford and Leeds as well as north Yorkshire. The amount of publicity and consultation necessary for separate admission arrangements will be dramatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bath spoke about the Greenwich judgment with respect to regulation No. 124, and I would like to raise the Rotherham judgment. The Minister is aware of our concern that that judgment caused many problems for admission arrangements. Regulations Nos. 124, 126, 251 and 258 do nothing to clarify the Rotherham judgment, and the code of practice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
complicates it even further. The law states clearly that parental preference always takes preference. That is the basis of the Rotherham judgment. Thus even the second, third or fourth choice takes preference over a parent who makes no choice at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worked for a long time in a deprived area in the eastern part of Leeds. Even under present arrangements, parents of the vast majority of students who accessed my school never filled in a preference form. They were simply binned and ignored. I am not blaming anybody, but that was the reality. Parents did not want to fill in forms, but automatically assumed that their children, living right next to the school, would come across the road to attend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also applies in London where LEA boundaries are not the same as geographical boundaries as far as communities are concerned. Children will suffer as a result of the Rotherham judgment. It could be said that parents should take greater interest and read what comes through the door, and that schools should encourage parents to take a more active part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree in principle with the Chancellor's statement that children are 20 per cent. of the population and 100 per cent. of our future. We must put children first, and they must not suffer as a result of the Rotherham judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice confuses the situation further. Paragraph A.30 deals with the law on the Rotherham judgment. It states that, in cases where parents have expressed more than one preference, the LEA
	<br><blockquote><p>"may adopt an admissions policy which applies some other criterion, compatible with parents' preferences and the guidance and objectives set out in this Code."</p></blockquote>
In other words, although the first preference may comply with the Rotherham judgment, the code of practice states that thereafter, an admissions policy can ignore other preferences. There is a direct contradiction between the interpretation of the Rotherham judgment and the content of the code of practice. Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also confusion over regulation 251 and banding arrangements, as is always the case when attempts are made to clarify matters in regulations. Paragraph 5.13 of the code of practice states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any banding arrangements should ensure that the intake represents the range of applicants' abilities."</p></blockquote>
What would happen if all the applicants to a school are of particularly high ability, as does happen? That is certainly the case for grammar schools, although I realise that they are exempt from this part of the statutory instrument. According to the code of practice, such an eventuality would not be acceptable. There is a further contradiction in the proposal that spare places, where available, have to be filled, irrespective of what band the children come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might therefore be a school that is genuinely trying, through its banding arrangements under the code, to have, for example, high-ability students make up 40 per cent. of its total numbers. It might then discover that it cannot fill its third band, designated for children with lower ability. Should it then take in more high-ability students, because it must fill those places, or should it reject them? Therein lies a contradiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Regarding order Nos. 124 and 251, does the Minister think that either the code or the regulations deal with one of the real challenges for our education system—pupils with challenging behaviour? The same dilemma exists now as before: if a school is over-subscribed, it can exclude a child, yet it would never have to take in a child who had been excluded from another school. That school has the best of both worlds and in my former career that matter always worried me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet an under-subscribed school can still be ordered, under the regulations, to take in a child who has been permanently excluded elsewhere. I know that the two-strikes rule helps a little there. It enables a school to say no. However, parents have got wise to the exclusion rules. If their child has been excluded once, but not yet been permanently excluded, they take the child out of school and try to get him or her admitted somewhere else. The regulations allow parents to play the system in that way, and they can be very adept at it. However, schools that are over-subscribed have no responsibility at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bath alluded in his speech to the issue of gender balance. Most schools in the United Kingdom are mixed-sex schools, and most of us who have run mixed-sex schools agree that the balance is very important. Unless there is a gender balance, there will be other distortions in the school. However, the regulations and the code of practice state that a school must fill its prescribed number of places, irrespective of gender balance. Will it be possible for a school to state in its admissions policy that it wants to maintain a gender balance and therefore not have to go up to its prescribed limit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that making regulations and a code of practice is difficult, but the measures do nothing to help schools,. The con of parental preference continues. There is more selection: grammar schools, banding and aptitude tests remain and so, therefore, do sink schools which have to cope with pupils with challenging behaviour. Frankly, I expected better from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily agree that this is a complicated set of regulations. Opposition Members made worthy contributions which showed concern about important education matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have raised so many issues that I will not be able to respond to all of them now. However, I shall write to the hon. Member for Maidenhead on the subject of nursery education. My initial understanding is that it is not affected by the regulations, but I am advised that the matter is rather complicated, which probably means that I need a different set of officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough who spoke about the difficulty of getting the measures right. Members of the Committee will agree that dealing with parental preference or choice—whatever one wants to call it—is incredibly difficult. The only long-term solution to the problem is to ensure that every school is a good school and that even if it is not their first choice, parents are satisfied with the education that their child receives. That must be our long-term aim.

The regulations are necessarily complex because education is a complicated service, containing 24,000 separate units with their own budgets and lines of accountability to the governing bodies. There are 150 local education authorities which have different relationships with each school, or group of schools, in their area. The Government, too, have a role to play in drawing up rules and guidelines that treat families as individuals whose choice for their children matters, and in devising a cohesive system that, inevitably, will be complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is that all those involved in the complicated business of the education service should be partners. The measures are not merely a set of regulations; they affect parents and everyone else involved in a child's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statutory instrument No. 251, on school information, which has received little comment, will, for the first time, bring together the admissions arrangements for every school in the area to which a parent may apply. Those of us who represent or live in constituencies where there are grammar schools, grant-maintained schools, voluntary-controlled schools and maintained schools, as there are in Birmingham, know that parents have to make many different admission arrangements in different time frames without having the opportunity to talk about the problems involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind that the present situation is not satisfactory: it is complicated, unhelpful and confusing for parents. At present, it appears that schools decide their admissions arrangements in their own interests and not in the interests of the generation of children in the local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where we begin. For the very first time, as a result of the measures, parents will have one document that brings together the admission rules for each of the admissions authorities within their area. That must be progress. How we go about that, by giving autonomy to school governing bodies and by making matters easy for parents, entails a complicated set of measures. I do not pretend that the matter is simple. In future, we might wish to reconsider some of the details in the regulations. However, we are confronting a new framework, new fair funding and new legislative rules for local education authorities. Getting those systems up and running for admissions in September 2000 means that they have all had to come into action at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, life would be simpler if we could consider matters separately, and bring them into play one by one. However, as we have said, we are determined to get the framework and the new rules running immediately so that we can get on with raising standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Underpinning the regulations is a genuine determination to make life easier for parents. They are not concerned with regulations and relevant areas, but they want ready access to information about the different schools to which their children may go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well appreciate that time is short. However, lest the Minister mislead the Committee, will she confirm that her remark about parents having a single
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
document is incorrect? The requirement in the code of practice is for admission authorities to attempt to work together with parents. There is no requirement that admissions authorities must do that. We are in favour of such a requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to provide clarification, and I apologise if my comments were unclear. The local authority is obliged to make available composite information of admissions arrangements for schools in a single document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable for the code of practice on appeal will shortly be laid before the House. That will be done before the Easter recess, and the timetable will be consulted on over the summer, not just over the week-long Easter holiday. So there will be ample time to consider the matter. It will come into force from 1 September. As it concerns appeals, that date accords with the regulations coming into force from 1 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of courtesy, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment wrote to his shadow spokesman, the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), indicating that a former Minister had been appointed as adjudicator. I regret that that information has been made public. I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong, but I understand that the Department for Education and Employment has made an announcement, and was intending to do so next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to apologise to the Minister and the Committee. I was not aware that that information had not been made public. I understood that the letter was received at the time that an announcement as being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that apology. The letter was about Robin Squire's appointment, and was sent as a matter of courtesy. I know that everyone in the House will welcome that appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will address the religious matters that were raised earlier. The points made about gender and ethnicity were new to our debate. In the present climate, we must ensure that we send out clear messages on such matters. The admissions arrangements and the adjudicator will have regard to the relevant measures on equal opportunity and race relations. We have always been clear about churches' special role, provision for which is made in an earlier measure. We sought to reassure the churches in our negotiations with them on the new framework. We assured them that the Secretary of State's role in relation to them would be retained in a way that it is not in relation to the rest of the school system. We may disagree about that, but assurance must be given at this point. We did not under pressure retain similar powers on gender and ethnicity for the Secretary of State. We are therefore satisfied that current measures will offer appropriate protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can therefore offer assurance to the hon. Member for Maidenhead. The adjudicator cannot act independently. He would have the local authorities' proposals for the relevant area and the objections, and then would make a decision based on those objections. He cannot come up with his own idea when there has been no objection to the definition of the relevant area. Again, it is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
complicated business of trying to ensure that there is agreement but if not, choosing between the aggrieved parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of parents is a sore point with the Liberal Democrats. They have been given a special role in terms of partial selection. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Government have been exercised by some local authorities whose system of partial selection has made life pretty difficult for some parents. We wanted to ensure that an objection could be heard. Unless we gave parents the right to object, none of the admissions authorities might have chosen to object. We could have had a situation in which no objection would have been made. That was the thinking that latterly brought in the parents' right to object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a statutory change in terms of banding. If more than 10 per cent. of admissions were by aptitude it would be a statutory change. That is less contentious and applies not only to some local authorities. We have now built into the whole schools system an opportunity for parents to have a voice on so many occasions. The parents are on the governing body. They will have a place on the local education authority. They have to be consulted in far more ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept intellectually that it is probably inconsistent that parents do not have that right for banding whereas they do for partial selection, I would argue that if we are honest, the severity of the instances and the level of public concern are vastly different. Parents should not be denied an opportunity to express a view in any of those ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will just have to disagree about aptitude. I will not take criticism from the Tories as assessment of aptitude appeared in their legislation, although I will take it from the Liberal Democrats because they are opposed to selection by ability and aptitude. The subjects that one can select on by aptitude and the word itself are all rolled over from legislation which we inherited from the Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what hon. Members say. There is a real challenge to do a number of things. I shall raise only two and then I shall conclude. I want to build a comprehensive system that is diverse. We all know that no two schools are the same. but I like the idea of having diversity in a community and telling parents that if children have an aptitude they ought to be able to go to a school that has a strength in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough pointed out, his school dealt with inclusion and special educational needs. That gave it problems, but it was acknowledged to have that strength. We ought to be honest about that and play to a school's strengths. I worry about our education system's poor performance in areas such as languages, sport and the performing arts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ultimate aim is for all schools to be expert in all those things but specialist schools are a means of encouraging an awareness of those specialisms. Given the money we have put in to make sure that they have a community perspective and spread good practice, not only the children who go to those schools will benefit from it. If they did, I would be very unhappy; we are busy building in links all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I apologise for finishing a bit early, but the Committee is in agreement that we should like to rise. I accept that these are complicated matters. I hope that the system goes well because it concerns one of the most important decisions that a parent ever makes—their child's education. It matters to all our constituents. We shall keep our eye on this and reflect on it. I shall ponder on some of the points that have been raised to which I do not have easy answers at the moment. It is an issue to which we will return in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I apologise to the Minister for any action that I may have taken unwittingly to breach a confidence. I appreciate that the Minister has not had the opportunity to reflect on all the issues that have been raised by Opposition Members. I ask her to read the transcript of the Committee and provide hon. Members in writing with the best answers to their questions that she can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was wrong to say that the Liberal Democrats oppose selection by ability or aptitude. Our point has consistently been that we do not know what aptitude is or how it can be assessed, so we can hardly be opposed to it. However, we think we are—and if we ever get a definition from the Government we shall know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
