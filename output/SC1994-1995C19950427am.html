</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to start our consideration of the Bill. Clause 1 is fundamental to the Bill. It is its cornerstone, as was clause 1 of the Disability Discrimination Bill. It defines disability, so it is sensible that it should be at the beginning. It delineates those who are to enjoy the rights conferred under the Bill. It is crucial to the success of any legislation of this sort that its definitions be right. The Committee will easily agree about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent much time in the autumn, when drafting the Disability Discrimination Bill, and the Committee spent much time when debating that Bill, considering its definition of disability. It is a difficult question. There is no absolute answer. We have to draw a line and people will inevitably fall on either side of that line. The Committee debating the Disability Discrimination Bill spent much time considering whether people with a history of disability should be included in the Bill's
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
definitions. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) asked whether people with a genetic predisposition to a disability should be included. Those are difficult questions. On Report, I announced that the Government's view was that a history of disability should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the definition, it must be capable of sensible application. People must know to whom the rights given under the Bill apply if they are to have any hope of observing the Bill's requirements. We must not forget the huge task ahead of all of us when the Disability Discrimination Bill reaches the statute book later this year. We shall have to communicate to employers and service providers what the law expects of them and why. It is easy for people to say now that they are in favour of anti-discrimination legislation; but it is another matter when they have to work, think and live differently to make the change meaningful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the definitions are too vague and confused or too sweeping, they will not work. Our task, to command the support of the country in implementing the Bill, would be made incalculably more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Wythenshawe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has talked about getting the definition right. Has he read the message to members of the Committee from the Adult Dyslexia Organisation? The ADO says, inter alia, that the Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"lacks teeth and does not define disability adequately."</p></blockquote>
Our concern—I am sure that it is shared to some extent by Conservative Members—is that the Bill must be informed by the opinions of disabled people. What is the Minister's response to the ADO?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman talking about the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill or the Disability Discrimination Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ADO was talking about the Government Bill. It believes that our Bill gets it right. The Minister spoke of making sure that we get the definition right. The ADO is happy that we have achieved that, but it is not happy about the Government's Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should prefer it if both the Minister and the right hon. Gentleman dealt with the amendment. The case that I would put would be that, somehow or other, the definition would be improved by the amendment. If the Minister advances that argument, he will be in order and if the right hon. Gentleman interrupts him, he will be in order, too. Indeed, we shall all be in order, which would be very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, is the Minister content that what he has now proposed would satisfy the organisation to which I referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is asking me about the definition in the Government's Bill. I admit that it is hard to debate this Bill without referring to that Bill. I am satisfied that the Government's approach to the definition of disability is right. I am, however, not satisfied with the definition under the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, which is why I tabled the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a definition that has to win public acceptance is too broad or eccentric, which it is under the Bill, it could do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
severe damage to the interests of disabled people. Public resistance to an unwelcome Bill would result in tardy and incomplete compliance. The ill feeling that would be created by a flawed definition would create resentment towards disabled people. If we ended up with campaigns against particular aspects of the Bill in the future, we would be moving backwards, not forwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. Can he tell the Committee how many people he thinks will be embraced by the definition in the Bill, compared with the definition in the Government's Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important issue. Various definitions and calculations have been made of the number of people who can be regarded as disabled. The figure that is often used is that of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, from its survey in 1988. That showed that there were 6.5 million disabled people of one sort or another in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible to say how many people would be covered by the definition in clause 1. One of the issues that I want to raise with the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) is how many people he thinks will be covered by the definition. That is one of the great uncertainties about the Bill. If we cannot say who will be covered by it, we shall have confusion and dissatisfaction in the future. That would lead to a loss of the support that the cause of genuinely disabled people commands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the Minister that his fear of a backlash—if we are excessively generous—is misplaced. There is good will in our society towards disabled people. Indeed, our debates about antidiscrimination legislation have helped to intensify that good will. He is envisaging an approach that is based on quantification. We are really talking about the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whether an intervention is long is a matter for me. Moreover, an intervention on an intervention is a parliamentary convention that has never yet been invented. I hope that we shall not create that precedent here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will agree, Mr. Hogg, that, thus far, my intervention had been rather short. We are concerned about the principle that we want to establish, which is that discrimination against disabled people should not be permissible or acceptable in our society. A piecemeal approach or a cumulative specification risks falling short of the establishment of that principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I very much agree with him about the principle. The principle of nondiscrimination against disabled people is what the promoters of this Bill are trying to establish in law and also what the Government are trying to establish in law through the Disability Discrimination Bill. That principle is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
It is also crucial that people who will have to implement the law should know to whom the law relates and should be able to respect the definition of disability that Parliament has adopted in the legislation. There are dangers of backlash against a law that pushes the case too far or is unfair to other people. We must be prepared to resist such a backlash, of which we can see a hint—we may talk about it later—in the discussions that followed my debate with the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) about the accessibility of taxis. The Government are considering that matter in their Bill in another place. I am now receiving letters, through hon. members of all parties, from taxi drivers, who say that the law will go too far and will put some of them out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Persuading people that we have got things right and that the law is justified is a challenge that we must all rise to when the legislation is enacted. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) is muttering something under his breath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My sedentary comment was that the example that the Minister has given is completely irrelevant to the debate about definition. Does he agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree. It is one thing to tell taxi drivers that they must make sure that their vehicles are accessible to people with a disability. That is one challenge to which they must rise. To tell them that they must make their vehicles accessible to people who may reputedly have a disability is to go into different and more uncertain territory. The definition is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the Minister and those who are interrupting him to return to matters that are before the Committee, which are amendment No. 1—which concerns the word "sensory"—and new clause 1, which is headed "Major life activities: guidance". If those matters were being debated, the debate would be in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have to, I shall apply the Standing Orders strictly, because it is not appropriate to make what amounts to a clause stand part speech when dealing with principles that are involved in the amendment of the definition. The Committee must deal with the precise nature of the amendment and the new clause that are before it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you are right, Mr. Hogg. There are some wide remarks about definition that I could make during a clause stand part debate. Like you, Mr. Hogg, I want to debate the amendment, but I have been slightly sidetracked by some of the interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 deals with sensory impairment. It would remove the term "sensory" from clause 1(a). Specific reference to sensory impairment is unnecessary, as all impairments will be either physical or mental. Some of us have discussed that matter before, in the Committee considering the Disability Discrimination Bill. We did not reach agreement then, but I set out clearly the Government's position on whether the word "sensory" should be included in the definition. I am being consistent in raising the matter again today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oddly enough, the amendment raises an important point of principle,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
which we debated elsewhere and which the Government have not yet clarified. I refer the Minister to the views of the Rights Now consortium, just one of the organisations working for disabled people and seeking to end discrimination against disabled people. It would argue, especially on the amendment, that the Government are dealing with medical conditions without removing existing discrimination, for which there is clear evidence and about which those organisations have told the Minister and other members of the Committee. They are dealing with discrimination in every sense, not simply a narrow definition. That would be made more difficult if the amendment were agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is where we disagree. The hon. Gentleman says that the definition would be narrower if the amendment were made. But it would not be narrower; it would be legally more practicable—more sensible—not to include the word "sensory" in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall further explain. As the hon. Member for Monklands, West has said, some parts of lobby and campaigning groups which represent blind and deaf people want to include the word "sensory" in the definition because they want to be reassured that sensory conditions would be covered if it were ever doubted whether a condition was physical or mental in origin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such worries are misplaced because the definition is obviously wide. A person will not have to prove that his or her impairment is physical if the only alternative is that it is mental. Whether a condition is physical or mental, the Bill covers the condition without needing to use the word "sensory."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members will be surprised by that argument. Indeed, when we drafted the Disability Discrimination Bill, it did not seem right to me. I took much legal advice on the matter and I considered the Americans with Disabilities Act, which did not include the term "sensory". To include such a term would imply that the terms "physical" and "mental" are not all-embracing. It might lead tribunals and others to seek to identify other categories which have not been mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and I hope that he feels that I am trying to be helpful. I refer him to Victoria Scott's account of her visit to America in which she accepted that, although much progress had been made, there were defects, one of which was the issue of definition. Does the Minister agree that as there are sensory problems—Sense has drawn attention to such problems—people might be doubly penalised because they are also HIV-positive without exhibiting symptons? Given such circumstances—the double penalty—and the lessons from America, is the Minister prepared to consider an improvement even on the American legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am. I hope that we can improve on the American legislation. I am aware of the report by Victoria Scott, but I am not aware that the problems to which the hon. Gentleman refers are to do with the omission of the word "sensory" from the definition in the ADA. That was not the heart of Victoria Scott's point
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
about definitional problems in the United States. My recollection of the report is incomplete, so I am not sure about that matter. I shall deal with other problems with the American definition when speaking to amendment No. 2. Before I do so, I shall finish speaking to amendment No. 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend explain what he believes the word "sensory" means, which conditions it covers and what proportions of those conditions are, on the one hand, physical and, on the other, mental?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a good question. All of us could define such matters in different ways. Presumably, in the vast majority of cases, a sensory disability would be counted as a physical one. We are talking about the overlap between the words "sensory" and "physical." My fear is that the inclusion of the word "sensory" implies that the other terms in the definition—"physical" and "mental"—are not all-embracing. Tribunals might begin to wonder whether psychological, as opposed to psychiatric, complaints were covered, or whether hysterical, as opposed to physical, symptoms were included, and so on. The term "sensory" in the definition adds nothing to the legal or medical meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of "sensory" is a well-intentioned but clumsy attempt to cover the entire range of disabilities in a single sentence. It is to be noted that the Americans with Disabilities Act, on which the Bill's definition of disability is based, does not use the term, so I wonder why it has been included. I think it may be because the Bill is trying to be an aspirational text rather than a legal document. It tries to reassure, rather than to legislate. But the wording of a manifesto, which reassures large groups of campaigning organisations, is not usually the language of the courtroom—the language of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have given, I believe that the word "sensory" may hinder the practical application of a perfectly noble intention. That is not a risk worth taking. It is an example of a definition which, if allowed to stand, would prove impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 raises an even more important issue. It refers to the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"major life activities of that person",</p></blockquote>
which is a key part of the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
Through the amendment I seek to raise issues about the phrase "major life activities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the word "sensory", the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"major life activities of that person"</p></blockquote>
has been borrowed from the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, but unlike that Act and its associated regulations, the Bill makes no attempt to explain the meaning of the term. The phrase suggests that "major life activities" are specific to the individual. It would not be reasonable, however, to give legislative protection where a person's disability impedes his or her pursuit of a highly individual aspiration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People may have major life activities which are not major life activities to other people. Can we be confident that an individual major life activity—such as that of a concert pianist or a ballet dancer—would not be covered by the definition as currently drafted, simply on the ground that the person had a condition that prevented him or her from being a concert pianist? The definition as drafted will raise such difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor should the Bill apply where a person has difficulty with, for example, private emotional or sexual relationships—undeniably major life activities—which have no bearing on ability to do jobs or on access to goods and services. The approach adopted in the Government Bill, which does not use the words "major life activities", is better suited for use in the United Kingdom courts. We must frame the law in a way that will work in the UK courts, which have a different tradition from that of American courts. Courts in this country have a tradition of literal interpretation. Amendment No. 2 would thus omit the words "of that person" from the definition. That difficulty has been recognised in the United States. Regulations published under the Americans with Disabilities Act list activities such as sleeping, breathing and walking as examples of major life activities. Clearly, such activities are crucial to everyone, regardless of individual traits or interests. The regulations not only explain what the ADA intends, but can be amended to ensure that that aspect of the definition works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not describe what is meant by "major life activities". Will the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) tell us what the courts should regard as "major life activities"? The courts may want to examine our proceedings for guidance. It is vital for us to know what the Bill's supporters mean by "major life activities"; will they be specific to an individual or will they be general, such as sleeping, breathing and walking, as in the legislation of the United States? Will those examples be promulgated under the Bill as it stands? If the only recourse will be codes of practice issued by the disability rights commission, how can the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East be sure that the commission will follow what he believes is desirable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because of those questions and uncertainties that I tabled amendment No. 4, which supplements amendment No. 2 by providing a power to prescribe what constitutes a major life activity. I am unable to accept that wording without a definition of what it involves. The term could include many life activities that have no bearing on a person's suitability for employment or the receipt of goods and services. My new clause 1 would enable the
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
Secretary of State to issue guidance about factors to be taken into account in determining whether or not
	<br><blockquote><p>"an impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities".</p></blockquote>
That guidance would be taken into account by the courts or tribunals when considering cases before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will leave decisions on the definition of disability to the courts and tribunals. I believe that it is in everyone's interests, not least those of disabled people, to know which conditions are covered. The Bill is too vague to help disabled people to understand their rights or for employers and service providers to understand their duties. The power to issue guidance would also allow flexibility in interpretation in the light of experience. That is very important in such legislation as medical knowledge and understanding about conditions progress. The guidance could clarify when a physical or mental impairment should be regarded as affecting "major life activities". I would expect an impairment to fall within the definition if it affected mobility, manual dexterity, physical co-ordination, continence, ability to lift, carry or otherwise move objects, speech, hearing or eyesight, memory or ability to understand, or perception of the risk of physical danger. Such activities might fall within the term "major life activities", but we do not know as the Bill stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am keen that there should be as much certainty as possible in the Bill. New clause 1 refers to guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister proposes that such guidance should deal with
	<br><blockquote><p>"the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a consequence"</p></blockquote>
limits a major life activity. Why cannot the guidance merely list major life activities? Would not that clarify the position for everyone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I agree that the guidance would have to include a list. It may include other matters to be taken into account, but we need to know what should be in that list. It is fair for us to ask the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East what he believes should be included in a list of "major life activities". A definition would help disabled people, employers and service providers to understand the measure and would help to prevent unnecessary litigation. If a dispute came before a court or tribunal, the guidance issued under the new clause would clarify exactly what should
	<br><blockquote><p>"be taken into account in determining whether the consequence of an impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities."</p></blockquote>
The need for the amendments is a further illustration of the fear that I mentioned earlier about the definition in the Bill being unworkable. The definition ducks the hard questions in pinning down exactly when the rights should apply. High-sounding terminology borrowed from another country may suit a coalition of diverse interests that support that definition, but vague phraseology hands over the application of the law to the lawyers and the courts, and it will not stand the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East can justify why the word "sensory" should be included in the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point of principle. Will he explain why he objects to relatively broad definitions being interpreted by the courts? Why is that less satisfactory than attempts to define in primary legislation all the detailed circumstances and conditions that should apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggests that there is a choice. I am not saying that everything should be laid down in primary legislation, but new clause 1 proposes regulation-making powers so that the Secretary of State can clarify and change the definition, with parliamentary approval, as medical knowledge and people's views change in the future. I believe that we should be clear about the definition. I favour that approach, rather than leaving the matter to the courts, because if the matter is unclear, many court cases will be confusing. People will not know whether their cases will succeed because case law has yet to emerge. As representatives of the electors, we should make the law as clear as possible, rather than leaving it to those who have to observe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I prefer a different approach. New clause 1 would make eminent good sense. It would not wreck the Bill and I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will consider it sympathetically. In order to understand what he is driving at, we need to know what he thinks is meant by the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"major life activities of that person"</p></blockquote>
rather than activities in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term "sensory" should remain, so I do not accept amendment No. 1. It is there partly for the avoidance of doubt and to ensure that certain areas are covered that might otherwise create problems. It is possible that someone could be judged to have a sensory impairment but not a physical or mental impairment. The courts will have to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different attitudes about distinguishing between physical and sensory attributes—that is a great philosophical discussion. Different people have different values and ideas about where the boundaries are, where they cross and whether there are precise and exact divisions. Some take the view that sensory activity is entirely physical and can be defined in physical terms, a philosophy called phenomenalism. Those people would support the Minister's view. Others dispute that, believing that there are possibilities associated with perception, which might involve any of the senses. Such people might come to a different judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is different from the issues surrounding some of the other terms that the Minister has mentioned, where extending the definitions of physical and mental impairment might mean that a whole host of people would want to claim that their concerns should be included. There is a considerable discussion about the term sensory. It is not just that many groups are concerned about loss of sight, hearing, taste or smell, but that the courts might find that a case of disablement was not covered. The clause is designed to cover such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would create some difficulties, as the word "sensory" occurs later in the Bill. For example, amendment No. 23 would delete a whole paragraph, and we might not choose to accept the amendment. However, there is no amendment that would allow us just to delete the word "sensory" from the paragraph. If we delete the word "sensory" now, we could find—if we proceed
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
quickly—that the word still occurs later in the Bill. I grant that that is a minor technical matter. It is less important than my major point, which is that the word should be included so as to avoid any doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify for the Committee what sort of sensory impairment he is talking about that is not either mental or physical? I am not clear about exactly what sort of cases he means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that someone who had lost all feeling in a leg and had difficulty in moving the leg would not be suffering any sensory pain. That might be a case about which the term physical would have to be used—the word sensory might not, in those circumstances, be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the hon. Gentleman is asking for an example in which the terms are the other way round, whereby someone has a sensory difficulty that might not be defined as being physical. There may be cases involving sight and perception in which it might be difficult to say exactly what the physical incapacity was, even though there was a clear loss of a faculty. The Bill would cover such cases. That deals more logically with the point that the hon. Gentleman raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are to be considered "major life activities"? The Minister produced a long list of his own, which included difficulty in lifting and carrying, and problems of incontinence. Those would obviously be considered major life activities. We must consider where such matters should be defined. The Bill will be interpreted by the courts and should allow for flexibility and a change in values over time, as the Minister said. It would also be influenced by the work of the Disability Rights Commission and its submissions, which would bring greater expertise and refinement to the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying—the Bill envisages that eventually there will be a different method of denning "major life activities"; but how does he know what the commission's definition will be? We are asked to make "major life activities" part of the law of the land, but we are asked to farm out the definition to a body that is not accountable to us. How does the hon. Gentleman know what the commission will say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we pass laws in Parliament, we often farm out the decisions that must then be made. We farm out a great deal to the courts, because we cannot conceive of every case to which a law would apply. We try to provide reasonable guidance to the courts. Likewise, we will give authority and power to a commission, as we did in the case of sex discrimination and race relations legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that the point of the amendments? The Bill does not provide adequate guidance. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"major activities of that person"</p></blockquote>
are so vague that when the courts tried to define them more precisely, they would not know what the House had in mind when it passed the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we required such a degree of precision, the Minister could have produced, instead of his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
amendments, a schedule listing the matters that should be taken into account, which he outlined in his speech. The definition of "major life activities" would then appear in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman's point has substance, that argument should cap it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such an approach would have allowed Parliament to define the terms. As the Minister has not chosen to adopt it, the refinement could be left to the courts and the commission, or the Secretary of State could issue guidance, possibly in conjunction with other legislation and advice from councils and other bodies. I would prefer the avenue towards which the Bill leads, as Parliament would ultimately have a greater say because of the link that we would have with the Disability Rights Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a useful discussion. The hon. Gentleman suggests that it might have been better to have added a schedule to the Bill, instead of the amendments that I propose. I would have an opportunity to do that during the later stages of the Bill. Is he saying that he would look more favourably on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am saying that the logic of the Minister's argument would be to do that. I do not share the Minister's view. I believe that the avenues for the interpretation of "major life activity" are adequate and understandable. I would have opposed a schedule of the sort suggested. It is inconsistent of the Minister to suggest that his Department could only produce written guidance in future. A schedule would be better, although the one suggested would not be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 provides a definition of a disabled person. It suggests three groups—first, those who have an impairment; secondly, those who have had an impairment in the past; and, thirdly, those who have a reputation as having an impairment or having had an impairment. My hon. Friend the Minister has proposed amendments that would change the definition of those who have an impairment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 would remove the word "sensory". I am in favour of clarity and simplicity in legislation, especially legislation that could affect so many people. We have already heard from my hon. Friend that about 6.5 million people will benefit from the Bill, although we cannot be sure. Perhaps, when we come to clause stand part, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will enlighten us by saying how many people he believes will benefit. It will clearly be millions of people. However, millions of able-bodied people will also be affected by the Bill, particularly employers. Large employers will find it easier to grapple with the Bill, but hundreds of thousands of small employers will also want to know what the law means and to whom it particularly applies. They will want to know who a disabled person is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that he included the word "sensory" to avoid doubt. However, my hon. Friend the Minister said that the inclusion of the word creates doubt because, in his view, all sensory impairments are either physical or mental. When my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Hendry) asked the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to give an
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
example of an impairment that was sensory but not physical or mental, the hon. Gentleman seemed to struggle for an answer. His first answer suggested the loss of all feeling in the legs, but he then realised that that was the reverse of what he was being asked. He then gave the example of people who suffered from poor eyesight, who had lost the ability to read or see properly. He claimed that such people did not suffer a physical disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By definition, a person with poor eyesight has a physical disability—there is something physically wrong with the eyes, which are not working normally. I am one of those fortunate people who has reached the advanced age of 47 without having to wear glasses. I know that I am fortunate because I note that all four hon. Members opposite—and you, Mr. Hogg—wear glasses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is it not stretching the credulity of the Committee for the hon. Gentleman to speak for two minutes about whether people wear glasses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am inclined to rule that the hon. Gentleman is in order. He may be stretching the point a little, but he is in order. He is endeavouring to define "sensory" in the context of the Bill. That is in order, and I shall allow him to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg. I was referring to the example that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East gave my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak when my hon. Friend asked him to give an example of a sensory impairment that was not either physical or mental. The hon. Gentleman referred to people who had poor eyesight. That is not an appropriate example. I am not a medical expert, but I believe that people who have difficulty with their eyesight have a physical impairment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition introduces an element of doubt. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, other examples could be included in the Bill for the avoidance of doubt. What about psychiatric impairments? Why are they not included in the definition? What is so special about sensory impairments? I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that sensory impairment should be omitted from the definition. That would make it clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is concerned about "major life activities". I agree that we must be told a little more about precisely what the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East had in mind when he referred to that. What he said did not take us very far forward. Clearly, he cannot mean the major life activities of a particular person. Otherwise, someone whose major life activity was climbing mountains, opera singing or another extreme activity—difficult to insure commercially—could argue that he or she was caught by the definition. It would be sensible to leave out the words "of that person", as proposed under amendment No. 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to go further; I am not sure that the Minister has gone far enough. As I said in an intervention during his speech, new clause 1 is permissive. It would not require the Secretary of State to
	<br><blockquote><p>"issue guidance about the matters to be taken into account in determining whether a consequence of an impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities."</p></blockquote>
If it did, it would help to determine major life activities. In the interests of certainty, I favour the idea of guidance. It is impossible for the House to produce legislation that will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
not be subject to interpretation in the courts and it will always be necessary to leave such matters to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it is important that we define matters in as clear and certain a manner as possible. I favour the concept of the Secretary of State issuing guidance. The new clause should go further and not just be about matters to be taken into account in determining impairments. There should be a list of what are deemed to be major life activities for the purposes of the Bill. They are an important part of the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on the amendments and to support the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I agree that the inclusion of the word "sensory" makes the definition less clear. I also considered that the response from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East showed that he did not have clear examples in his mind of sensory impairments. He was grappling in the dark. I am not sure whether that was an example of sensory impairment, but he was trying to define something that he was not certain existed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of using our imagination. In certain circumstances, the sense of taste, for example, may be absent or limited. It may be difficult to define it as a physical characteristic or an associated element. I should have thought that that would apply to any of the senses. The loss of sight may have been caused by physical factors and characteristics; someone might have a genetic disposition towards various difficulties, such as hysterical deafness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is so fraught with different viewpoints. One viewpoint—a common attitude—is that physical impairment and sensory impairment are one and the same, or so interlinked that there should be no distinction. But that is by no means so in all circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that further explanation. I am greatly worried by the fact that he said that it was a matter for the imagination. We are talking not about imagination but about a major piece of legislation that would make a fundamental difference to millions of people, to every business and to everyone's working life in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering each sense to find out whether it is sensory or physical. Clearly, as my hon. Friend the Minister has said, bad eyesight, approaching near blindness, is a physical impairment. It is also a sensory impairment, but it is dealt with by the physical definition. If something is wrong with someone's taste buds, he or she has a physical problem. Whether that is grounds for discrimination is questionable. If something is wrong with someone's sense of touch, something is wrong with his or her nervous system and, therefore, he or she is affected by a physical disability. Similarly, problems with the sense of hearing are directly related to physical disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the sense of smell is a dubious area. If someone has a poor sense of smell, he or she might be sensorily impaired. That is neither a physical nor a mental disability. But should we incorporate into disability legislation protection for people who have a poor sense of smell? Should a restaurant owner be accused of discriminating against someone because he says that that person cannot properly smell the wine or the food? Is that really what the Bill intended to do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
By including the concept of sensory disability, the Bill is diminished, rather than made clearer. The inclusion of the word "sensory" is unhelpful because it is linked under the clause to the use of the word "reputation." The word "sensory" cannot be used, as the Bill also includes people who have a reputation of a sensory impairment, such as bad eyesight or hearing difficulties. That makes the matter much more grey for the courts, which must have to determine whether someone is genuinely disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters have to be looked at in the light of medical progress. People with sensory impairment increasingly find that problems, such as bad eyesight or poor hearing, can be overcome. But they might find that, because they had a reputation or history of bad eyesight, they are covered by the Bill in a way that the House does not intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised when my hon. Friend introduced to the debate the matter of sense of smell because problems with that sense involve physical impairments. Those who cannot smell properly have a physical problem with their nasal glands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point. Behind all sensory impairments there are physical difficulties. But should the Bill deal with such matters? We should concentrate on the key issues of disability. The clause introduces an unhelpful element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment on the phrase "major life activities", which the clause contains. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East and I share a constituency boundary. Many people visit our constituencies for activities such as hang gliding or rock climbing. Many of them will sustain disabilities because of such activities. Clearly, they are major life activities because they are an important part of life for many people. They are not part of their working lives, but they are important hobbies in which people take part week after week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the inclusion in the clause of the words "of that person", will people who are unable to take part in their former hobbies, because of disabilities sustained in the course of those hobbies, be protected by the Bill? The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East seems to want to intervene. If he does not, I hope that he will clarify the matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, in that I believe that the Minister should have gone further. An amendment should have been tabled that would have deleted the phrase "major life activities" altogether, as it does not sit well in English law. It must sound like an American phrase to the whole Committee—it is the kind of thing that Americans talk about. We should not encourage the practice of transplanting American phraseology into British law. To transplant English law into American law is understandable, as America is a much younger democracy, but we should not encourage the incorporation of American verbiage into our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments tabled my my hon. Friend the Minister and I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, who is the Bill's promoter, will take the opportunity to counter some of the points that we have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a revealing opening exchange. I asked the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East several questions when I moved the amendment and when I put my case about the word "sensory" and the phrase "of that person". As my hon. Friends the Members for Beaconsfield and for High Peak have pointed out, the answers that the Committee received were not encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East more or less began his response by saying, "This is a matter that the courts will have to deal with." That is precisely what we are worried about. We are being asked to take on trust legislation whose proponents find it difficult to give practical examples of how it will operate. We, the Parliament of this nation, are meant to hand over to the courts the ability to define the law, because we have left it extremely vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East failed to deal with our questions about the use of the term "sensory". As my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak said, he asked us to use our imagination. That, too, was not an encouraging start. Having used his imagination, he gave us one example that was the wrong way round—but we can all make that mistake. He then used the example of sight, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, must be considered a physical condition on any commonsense definition. The example of taste was given. Taste is also a physical condition—when there is a problem, that is a physical disability. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak mentioned smell, but I tend to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, in that problems with smell could also be classed as a physical disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every disability or condition that the Committee has been able to think of can be classed as physical or mental. The inclusion of the word "sensory" creates uncertainty about what other terms should or should not have been included. That is the point that I have been making, and it must stand—it has not been defeated in the debate so far, although my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon might be about to produce an argument that none of us has yet heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it matter if there is an element of tautology in the wording of the clause and if there is an overlap between the terms "physical" and "sensory"? If there is a belt and braces approach, does that do any harm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It probably does not do any harm in the way that my hon. Friend seems to be thinking about. However, it may do harm if courts are able to ask why the legislation does not include the terms psychological, psychiatric or hysterical? Once something tautologous has been introduced people can ask why other such factors are not included. Belts and braces can be much more extensive than the Bill's definition needs to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the least of my concerns however. I also asked the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to define "major life activities". He said that some of my suggested examples were good. If a Bill of mine had the term "major life activities" in the first few lines, I should think long and hard about what those activities might be before
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
bringing it before a Committee for detailed scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman has not been able to furnish us with any examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know whether my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is right to say that the phrase is taken from United States legislation? If so, is there already a list of activities that could assist the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is right; and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is right to ask whether there is already a list. There is a regulation-making power in the Americans with Disabilities Act, under which a list has been compiled. This Bill, however, contains no regulation-making power. The commission has the power to produce a list of major life activities, but we do not know, and no one can yet give us guidance on, what will be in that list. That list will be part of a code of practice and, as the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East pointed out, that could be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. However, that code of practice would not have legal force, so courts could still come to conclusions different from what the House intended, different from what the Disability Rights Commission intended and different from what Parliament might say at a later date. That is ludicrous way to legislate. Little of the rest of the Bill can be put right if the definition of disability is not right. Nothing we have heard reassures us that the Bill's supporters know what they mean by "major life activities".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister clarify what he said? Does he mean that the Bill's supporters may have in mind a definition of what they mean by "major life activities", that the disability commission could subsequently define it differently and that the courts could thereafter interpret it differently and in a way that bears no relation to the views of hon. Members or the commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend understands what I say all too well. That is a good description of the legal chaos that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East invites us to approve. It is not satisfactory basis on which to frame legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister is understanding the parliamentary safeguards incorporated in the Bill. Clause 3(6) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall lay copies"—</p></blockquote>
copies of a code of practice drawn up by the Disability Rights Commission—
	<br><blockquote><p>"before Parliament; and if either House of Parliament resolves that the Code of Practice be withdrawn the Commission shall withdraw that Code of Practice".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, under subsection (9), the Secretary of State has the power to require the commission to 	<br><blockquote><p>"revise the whole or any part of any Code of Practice".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend slightly misses the point. I have already referred to the fact that there would be later parliamentary scrutiny. He is right to say that that is provided for in clause 3, but even after parliamentary scrutiny, we would have only a code of practice rather than a regulation with legal force. Codes of practice have to be taken into account by the courts but they do not have to do what the practice suggests.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
The summary given by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak is a valid one. Supporters of the Bill may have a list of major life activities in mind; the rest of us may have another list; and neither of those might be the one produced by the Disability Rights Commission. It will be given 18 months to do that, by which time the courts may have already reached a judgment on the matter and a list that is different from that envisaged by the Committee or the commission may be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised a different point under amendment No. 2, referring to the words "of that person", and my hon. Friends the Members for High Peak and for Beaconsfield also referred to that. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak drew attention to the rock climbing activities in his constituency, which was a good analogy. What if an experienced mountain climber lost two of his fingers because of frost bite, or because of an accident? That would disable him from pursuing what to him is a major life activity. He may have spent all his spare time climbing mountains. Would he be entitled to be regarded as a qualified disabled person under clause 1? Having been prevented from pursuing his major life activity, he might be unable to perform the essential functions of an employee. Would he be counted as a qualified disabled person? That is the sort of strange circumstance that might arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be reasonable for an employer to discriminate against such an individual? If the Minister does not think that, what is the debate about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but we are taking the law into a dangerous area if someone can say in court that he is a qualified disabled person because of the circumstances that I have just described, and claims the protection of the law because he did not get a job that he wanted. That would bring the proposed legislation into disrepute extremely quickly and it would be very difficult to tell employers how to interpret it. People could become qualified disabled people in a vast range of circumstances that none of us associate with any commonsense understanding of the term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand what the Minister is saying. Is he suggesting that if an employer discriminates against a person in those circumstances, that should be lawful? I understand the problems when debating the extension of definitions, but the Minister's point has significance only if he is saying that there is no problem with an employer discriminating against someone who can fulfil the essential functions of a job but happens to have two missing fingers. Surely the Minister is not encouraging us to spend our time discussing such matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two answers to that. The hon. Member for Kingswood and I had a similar debate on the definition in the Disability Discrimination Bill. We need a commonsense definition dealing with people who would be generally accepted as disabled. If we had a law saying
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
that a mountain climber who had lost the end of his little finger was to be counted as a qualified disabled person, and that employers should take that into account, such a law would not enjoy wide credibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Bill, a person who had lost the end of a finger would be qualified disabled in the sense that, as long as he could do the job that he did previously, he should be allowed to continue to do it, and the argument of disability should not be used against him in order to discriminate against him. That is important, and it is why the amendment should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we are now clear about what the hon. Gentleman intended. His definition of a qualified disabled person is much wider than any that might have been used by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to identify 6.5 million disabled people. The Bill would broaden the definition to include, potentially, anyone in the population. The hon. Gentleman asks us to accept that. It is a fundamental problem with his Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the Bill deals with everyone, because everyone can become disabled. It is legislation of a general nature affecting disabled people. As people grow old and infirm, they become disabled, which affects their access to goods and services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing two points, I think. He says that everyone can become disabled, which is quite correct. Any of us could become disabled today or tomorrow, through accident or illness. Furthermore, as the hon. Gentleman said, as people become old and infirm, they can become disabled. In saying that, he is thinking about disability in the way that most of us would think about it. The problem with his Bill is that the definition could include people who have not become old or infirm, who have not had an accident or an illness, and who are not disabled in any commonly accepted sense of the term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the central problem. We are asked to tell employers and service providers that we have passed legislation to ensure that disabled people have the same opportunities as the rest of us and are included in every aspect of life, like the rest of us—objectives that we all share—but when those employers and service providers ask, "How do we know who is covered by the legislation?", the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will say that it may cover any of the 58 million members of the population of the United Kingdom. He would be putting himself, Parliament and the country in a ludicrous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still not clear, however, whether the hon. Gentleman intends that the major life activities to be specified by the Disability Rights Commission should be individual or general. Will they be activities associated with a particular individual, or will they be general activities of which I gave examples earlier—walking, breathing, sleeping and so on—as I envisage? The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with that point. I would welcome his doing so before we conclude the debate on this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have listened carefully to the debate as we proceeded
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
since yesterday. I want to make an appeal to the Minister. He has spoken this morning for perhaps an hour. If he has not done so yet, he will soon exceed an hour. He has the power to allow the Bill to proceed to the House of Commons tomorrow to its Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through you, Mr. Hogg, may I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendments, which are in order and which have been rightly selected? Does he appreciate that disabled people outside the House consider what is happening in Committee an abuse of Executive power? Madam Speaker said that she wanted both Bills to be given a fair hearing. In the view of disabled people, that is not happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. The right hon. Gentleman is taking us back to yesterday's debate. In today's debate we have seen the need for detailed consideration of the Bill, because the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has not so far been able to answer some of our most basic questions about the first few lines of the Bill. If the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) thinks that, under those circumstances, the Bill should be allowed to proceed to its next stage, that is an odd way to view parliamentary proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's point of order was not a matter for me. Appeals to Ministers or other members of the Committee cannot be made through me. The Standing Orders make no provision for that. As for the nature of today's debate, everything that has been said so far has been in order. I can only guide the proceedings within the rules of the Standing Orders. I have been careful to pay close attention to all that has been said this morning. So far, all the speeches have been conducted properly and have been in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my point of order, Mr. Hogg. I accept that everything that has happened is within the rules of order. It is easy to speak at great length on the definition. This is not my first debate on the definition of disability. From 1972 to 1981, I chaired the international committee that laid down international criteria. I am sure, therefore, that you understand how I feel when I am lectured at such length on a day when the Bill's progress is of crucial importance to disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the points that the right hon. Gentleman is making, but they are not matters on which I can give advice or rule. As long as speeches are within the Standing Orders, I, like other members of the Committee, must listen to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, for your ruling. I appreciate and understand the appeal made by the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe. He is in favour of the Bill and, naturally, he would like it to proceed through Parliament, a process in which he will ask other hon. Members to co-operate. I am sure that he respects my position, too. I have just taken through the House a Bill which is on the same subject, but which is different from this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given what the Minister has just told us, how can he justify spending virtually a whole morning on one word and then challenging my hon. Friend,
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
claiming that he had not defined disability properly? Apart from mere filibustering, how can the hon. Gentleman justify the fact that, in the Committee that considered the Government's Bill, not two seconds were spent debating a woman losing two fingers as she was climbing a hill, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In respect of that point of order, it would be helpful for the Minister to return to the central issues under debate. We have had a long debate on the word "sensory". I think that I now know more about that word than "Chambers Dictionary" does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Hogg. I too want to conclude the debate on the group of amendments. I merely say, in passing, to the hon. Member for Monklands, West that we spent a whole Committee sitting debating the definition in the Disability Discrimination Bill. We do not know how long we shall take to debate the other aspects of the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not perhaps—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Committee appreciates your position and accepts your ruling. But we are entitled to tell the Minister that we are not wet behind the ears. Clearly, the Government are abusing the Committee. They want to kill a Bill, instead of being honourable and telling us their opinions. At present, many disabled people and their carers are heading for the House to protest against the Government's appalling abuse of parliamentary procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can do nothing to speed the Committee's progress. What happens in that respect is in the hands of the members of the Committee. I am satisfied that, so far, speeches have been in order. Therefore, I do not subscribe to the view that there has been abuse in that sense. Speeches may have been long, but they have been in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, for your protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In bringing my remarks on the matter to a close, I should say that we would have concluded the debate much earlier if the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, or any of the Bill's supporters, had answered the questions that I have asked. If there has been an abuse of Parliament, it has been to come to Parliament with provisions that no one can explain which include terms that no one can define.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The terms have been defined time and again. We have spent much time on the debate. We have defined the word "sensory" many times before. The Minister does not want to make progress; he is delaying the proceedings. If he wanted to make progress, he would withdraw all the amendments on the amendment paper. The people outside this building want progress. They want civil rights for disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Lady says that the terms have already been defined. Perhaps she will tell the Committee how she defines "major life activities".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment, too, is about the Bill's definitions. I hope that our discussion is briefer than that on amendment No. 1, because amendment No. 3 covers similar matters and there is no need to cover the same ground again. I certainly do not want to hold up the Committee unnecessarily. Although it is not strictly in order for me to say so, I can say that I should be happy, through what I must call unusual channels, to come to an agreement about our progress, so that the Bill can receive proper scrutiny in a good atmosphere and accusations need not be made about time wasting. Perhaps that can be discussed after the proceedings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is concerned with reputation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Minister has made a suggestion that he seems to want us to consider. Would it be in order for the Committee to adjourn to consider what the Minister said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Minister offered to those who support the Bill a discussion outside the Committee—through what he described as unusual channels—as to how the Bill may proceed. I think that the Minister meant that it should receive more effective scrutiny. I shall take the Clerk's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
I could at this stage accept a dilatory motion from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East—I remind the Committee that such a motion would be debatable—that the Committee should adjourn for the rest of the morning. It would not be for five or ten minutes, but until 1 pm. It is up to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister's offer was that he would be willing to have such a discussion at a future stage. My impression was that he did not contemplate that taking place until after today's proceedings. I was about to intervene to ask whether that discussion could not be started after this morning's sitting in order to discover what progress could be made. I would be reluctant to propose such a motion unless I had a clear assurance from the Minister that he was going to talk turkey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East is right in his judgment. We can discuss the matter outside the Committee. There are some extremely detailed matters to consider, but I am talking about the Committee dealing with the Bill in a number of sittings, which would take place during a period that is a good deal longer than a day. I do not want to raise hopes about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. A little more clarification is called for from the Minister. He must know that what is of crucial importance to us and to disabled people outside the Committee Room is that the Bill should conclude its Committee stage today if it is to have any chance of having a Report stage. Will the Minister clarify—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not want the Minister to do that. I do not want points of order to be used to negotiate matters that would ordinarily be conducted through the usual channels, as I recall from the days when I held great office in the House as deputy Chief Whip. The right hon. Gentleman has long experience, and is a trifle wily at times. I think that he was going to start negotiations with the Minister through points of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am impugning the hon. Gentleman's reputation. It would be inappropriate to negotiate in that way. Unless the Minister has anything else to say, I understand from his remarks that he is not offering a device that would enable the Bill to be discussed tomorrow morning. He is quite clear about that. If that is so, we should get on with proceedings for better or for worse. If I have got something wrong, the Minister may raise another point of order to clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->

Our concerns about the inclusion of the term "reputation" are well known to many Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
members. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon and I have often discussed the term as it relates to people with a genetic predisposition. My hon. Friend favours including the term in the Bill because he fears that people with a genetic predisposition to a condition may be discriminated against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have on previous occasions set out my misgivings about that. We debated it when the Disability Discrimination Bill was on Report. I explained that it is conceivable that the majority of the population could have some genetic predisposition that could be identified in the near future. Tests are not 100 per cent. reliable. A genetic predisposition does not mean that a person will necessarily or even probably suffer from the condition to which they are predisposed. The term "reputation"—whether it refers to genetic predisposition or other matters—broadens the scope of the Bill considerably and detracts from what is currently understood to be a disability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that my concern is that we should consider reputation on a much broader basis. If my hon. Friend the Minister is saying that it should be within the law for a person to discriminate against another person because he thinks that that other person is disabled, I fear that my hon. Friend is allowing a licence for a prejudice of the ugliest kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We certainly need to think about the matter in a broader sense than how it applies to genetic predisposition. I was using that as an example of the arguments that are used in favour of including the term "reputation". I understand and respect the point that my hon. Friend makes. The counterargument, which I have always put, is that, for the law to work, it needs to be about people who have a disability. It would be much more difficult to operate a law that was about people who may have, or who have never had, a disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "reputation" has been borrowed from the Americans with Disabilities Act, although the term used in that Act is "regarded as". The hon. Member for Monklands, West mentioned the problems referred to in the report by Victoria Scott. There are problems with the definition, some of which arise from the term "regarded as". The provisions in the Americans with Disabilities Act have been construed to include people who are obese, for example, but who do not have any disability in any commonsense use of that term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The American experience demonstrates that there can be tremendous problems in involving groups with marginal connections to disability. There are already large backlogs of complaints and great employer uncertainty. Groups that were, rightly, intended to be excluded from the Act have managed to complain by claiming that they have a reputation for having a disability. There are fears that drug addicts who have gone on a rehabilitation programme can claim the protection of the Act on the grounds that they have a reputation as being disabled because of a suspected continuing addiction to narcotics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, people would be unsure whether they were complying with the law—that is the same problem that we discussed earlier. Others would be unsure whether they had a case for complaint. By definition, reputation introduces a subjective element. We cannot foresee who
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
might claim to have suffered discrimination because they were reputed to be disabled—for example, short, fat or old people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the definition should be to cover those who require statutory protection because of a disability. People with only a reputation for an impairment are not disabled in any common use of the word and should not be covered by the Bill. If they were covered, that would provide further examples—we have heard some in our earlier discussion—by which the law could be held up to ridicule. How would an employer or a service provider know whether someone had a reputation? How many people have to think something about a person before that person has a reputation? Does the employer or the service provider have to be one of the people who thinks that about a person in order for that person to have a reputation that counts for the purposes of the measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East will be able to assist us in clarifying such difficulties. We need to know what sorts of people might be classed as having a reputation of being disabled. We need to know how employers or service providers would know whether someone whom they have refused to employ or serve—because of an angry outburst, for example—could take them to a tribunal or court on the grounds that he or she had a reputation for disability. What does the hon. Gentleman think that the guidance should be from the Commission? Would that guidance be acceptable and workable? What will happen if the Commission's guidance is overturned by the courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain to the Committee why he is putting questions to my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East about the Commission when he refused to give the same definitions and explanations about the work of the advisory body proposed in the Government's Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I refused to do that. The crucial difference between the two Bills on this matter is that the Disability Discrimination Bill will provide for regulation-making powers, so that the Government of the day must provide more detail on how the legislation will work. Rulings of courts or tribunals will be based on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill takes a different approach, under which a commission will produce guidance, most of it not, as I understand it, with legal force. Codes of practice would be produced. We are being asked to take on trust to a much greater extent what the work will be and how it will be conducted. It is necessary for some explanation to be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not asking for every precise aspect of the guidance that would be given by a commission to be outlined, but it is fair to ask the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to cite examples of the guidance or to illustrate what it would contain. If the Bill were to become law, what has been said in Committee or in the House would be important for a commission or for anyone considering the future application of the law. Those are the aspects that worry me about the term "reputation", which is why we did not include it in the Disability Discrimination Bill. I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not provide the whole list of items that the Minister, is seeking in the same way that I did not give a host of definitions of major life activities. If I did so, each item would be picked up by the Minister and used elaborately to extend our discussions, as happened earlier. The hon. Gentleman knows that whatever I say in Committee about the scope and provision of the Bill has no relationship to the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister takes an entirely different approach from us about civil rights for disabled people. It is reflected in the amendment, which would remove the provision about a person having a reputation of disability. At one time, the hon. Gentleman was opposed to a history of impairment. That was changed in his Bill. Disability is not a dirty word. It is not something which needs exact boundaries for who is allowed to be included in the category of disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the discriminators against disability. If we do not have the reputation of a person included in the Bill, there is a danger of giving a charter to those who wish to continue discrimination. Now they are covered in such actions as long as they do not discriminate against those under subsections (a) and (b) of the clause, but they could discriminate against someone who had a reputation of having an impairment. As the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon said, there is a great danger that the amendment would be a licence for prejudice. The Bill must apply to the potential discriminator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Hogg, that you will extend equal protection to all members of the Committee, and we look to you as our great protector. If the term is not endearing to you, I will find another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard an extraordinary speech from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, who began by saying that he would not answer any questions raised on this side of the Committee, which means that he would simply ignore legitimate concerns expressed by us, our
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
constituents and many commentators outside. His speech consisted of bland generalities, which do not assist the Committee's progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of the word "reputation" is one of the most disturbing aspects of the Bill. It is confusing to people who are disabled. How will they know whether they have a reputation for disability? Would they be covered, without going through the process of consulting the commission and seeking legal advice to find out whether they had such a reputation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point is misconceived. The clause specified three different groups. People who are disabled are caught by the first group in paragraph (a). We are discussing people who are not actually disabled but have the reputation of being disabled, so disabled people need have no fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point, but there is a grey area. Many conditions that might make someone disabled can, thanks to medical advances, be cleared up. I referred earlier to sight and hearing impairment. Tremendous progress has been made, for example, in hip replacement, so people who were physically disabled can be given much greater mobility. Under the clause, however, they would still have a reputation for disability. Clearly, that is not intended. As a result of medical progress, people move in and out of a state of disability, but they will not know whether or not they are covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that beside the point? Of course people's conditions will vary from time to time. If people can make a case that they have suffered discrimination on the ground that they are regarded as being disabled—for example, people who have been diagnosed as having a particular illness but do not yet have the symptoms, and countless other examples that we can all think of—the Bill would give them protection. We are not talking about people's conditions being constant throughout their lifetimes. If people can demonstrate that they are being discriminated against because of a perception that they are disabled, why should they not have the protection of the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No. The hon. Member for High Peak—who was ably assisted by the hon. Member for Kingswood—was still speaking, and I want to hear what he has to say. A closure motion should be moved when a debate is exhausted, when hon. Members repeat themselves or when arguments are repeated, and so on. It is a matter of judgment, but debate on such amendments should last for about an hour at most. That is my rule of thumb on the matter. Perhaps I am giving away trade secrets and the Chairmen's Panel is somewhat masonic on such matters,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The Minister has tabled 111 amendments. Using your calculation, the remaining amendments would take another 109 hours—months of sittings. There is no time for that. Does not that prove that the procedure—not because of any lapse on your part, Mr. Hogg—will look silly to people outside the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I qualified my comments by saying, "on such amendments". Such amendments are important
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
amendments to the principle clause. I do not want to argue about such matters. The Committee is debating the key clause and serious amendments moved by the Minister. I must assume that those who are promoting the Bill and those who are responding to it are doing so in a responsible fashion and in accordance with the normal procedures of the House. If the usual pattern is followed, some amendments will not be moved, others will be disposed of quickly, others will be withdrawn and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An hour's debate on the major issue of a Bill is not unreasonable. It is not unreasonable for me to expect the Bill's supporters and the Government to conduct the debate in that context. However, one lives and learns in this job, and the right hon. Member has much experience with the Bill, as he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. You will be relieved to know that I plan to speak for much less than an hour. When people read the 
	<i>Official Report</i> tomorrow, they will discover that the point of order has probably lasted longer than my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Kingswood. But a wider legitimate concern is that a term as loose as "reputation" can be broadly interpreted by the commission and the courts. Those whom one would not intend to be covered by the provisions of the Bill could find that they have a case in law to say that they had such a reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People with disabilities want legislation that protects them. Any measure that goes too widely beyond that—one which includes those who have a reputation, but not a disability—brings—many people within its scope. If that were so, many of the people whom the Bill is intended to help would find that they were prejudiced because such a Bill would be seen as bad legislation. Such a measure would give rights to those for whom such rights were never intended. Many disabled people would rather know that the Bill would directly help those with disabilities. The definition is extremely vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now dealing with the third group of people who are defined by the Bill as disabled—those with the reputation of having or having had an impairment. Such groups are alternatives—we are talking about people who are not actually disabled, which is the point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak earlier. I said that the definition should be certain and not too broad, but this part of the Bill fails both tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do we mean by certainty? The word "reputation" must mean the general opinion that most people have about an individual. However, general opinion, like popular or public opinion, can easily be misconceived. I believe that that broadens the definition too much and introduces an element of uncertainty. It is wrong to do that because we shall be unable to convince people outside the House about the clearly good intentions of the proposed legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has just noted the good intentions of the proposed legislation. Among those is a provision making it illegal for an employer to
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
discriminate against someone because the employer believes that person to be disabled. If my hon. Friend thinks that the formulation suggested in the Bill is inappropriate to achieve that end, how would he meet it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend has answered his own question. He said that if an employer thought that someone was disabled, that situation should be covered, but that is not the same thing as someone having the "reputation" of being disabled. That means general opinion in this context, but my hon. Friend's proposal means that the opinion of one person—the employer—would be sufficient. That is not what the Bill says, but my hon. Friend could table an amendment to that effect, although I could not support it because that definition would still be too broad. I think that we must draw the line between certainty and what will command widespread support. The provision referring to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a reputation as a person who has or had such an impairment"</p></blockquote>
is too broad and uncertain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East responded to my opening remarks on the amendment and he was right to say that there is a fundamental difference in how the two Bills treat such topics. I was not persuaded by his response to my request for an illustration of the sort of guidance that would be given. Nor did he assure me that that guidance would be acceptable and workable. It was strange to refuse to give examples because they might be attacked. I do not know what would happen at Question Time if Ministers said that they would give no examples of how their policies will work because an Opposition Member might get at them. That seems to be the position that the hon. Gentleman is adopting—I might even be tempted to try that approach. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be a little more forthcoming with information in the remainder of our debate. It has illustrated, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, that immense uncertainty will arise from the use of the term "reputation", and I do not believe that sufficient thought has been given to how it will work in practice. It could lead to difficult cases in the courts and that is why we have not included it in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. To be consistent with our position on that, which is well justified, I ask my hon. Friends to vote for my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>eliminating discrimination against disabled persons in the field of employment; or</li>

	<li>encouraging good practice in relation to the employment of disabled persons.</li>

	<li>the circumstances in which it would be reasonable, having regard in particular to the costs involved, for an employer to be expected to make accommodation in favour of a disabled person; or</li>

	<li>what steps it is reasonably practicable for employers to take for the purpose of preventing their employees from doing, in the course of their employment, anything which is made unlawful by this Act.</li></ol>

	<li>A failure on the part of any person to observe any provision of a Code does not of itself make that person liable to any proceedings.</li>

	<li>A Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings under this Act before an industrial tribunal, a county court or a sheriff court.</li>

	<li>If any provision of a Code appears to a tribunal or court to be relevant to any question arising in any proceedings under this Act, it shall be taken into account in determining that question.</li>

	<li>In this section and section 
	<i>(Further provision about Codes issued under section (Codes of practice prepared by the Secretary of State))</i> "Code" means a Code issued by the Secretary of State under this section and includes a Code which has been revised and re issued.".</li></ol></p>

	<i>(Codes of practice prepared by the Secretary of State),</i> the Secretary of State shall consult such organisations representing the interests of employers or of disabled persons in, or seeking, employment as he considers appropriate.

	<ol>

	<li>Where the Secretary of State proposes to issue a Code, he shall publish a draft of it, consider any representations that are made to him about the draft and, if he thinks it appropriate, modify his proposals in the light of any of those representations.</li>

	<li>If the Secretary of State decides to proceed with a proposed Code, he shall lay a draft of it before each House of Parliament.</li>

	<li>If, within the 40-day period, either House resolves not to approve the draft, the Secretary of State shall take no further steps in relation to the proposed Code.</li>

	<li>If no such resolution is made within the 40-day period, the Secretary of State shall issue the Code in the form of his draft.</li>

	<li>The Code shall come into force on such date as the Secretary of State may appoint by order.</li>

	<li>Subsection (4) does not prevent a new draft of the proposed Code from being laid before Parliament.</li>

	<li>The Secretary of State may by order revoke a Code.</li>

	<li>In this section "40-day period", in relation to the draft of a proposed Code, means—

	<ol>

	<li>if the draft is laid before one House on a day later than the day on which it is laid before the other House, the period of 40 days beginning with the later of the two days, and</li>

	<li>in any other case, the period of 40 days beginning with the day on which the draft is laid before each House.</li></ol>
no account is being taken of any period during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.".</li></ol></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, last time I did so the hon. Gentleman said that his intervention would be relevant to the amendment. It was not. You, Mr. Hogg, wish me to speak to the amendment, which is what I want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Surely it cannot be irrelevant for me to respond to a point that you rightly judged was relevant. May I point out to you that, whereas the Minister has all the resources at his disposal, we have limited resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When the hon. Gentleman was the distinguished provost of Monklands, I was but a humble trade union official trying to appeal to him as an employer. He used to confuse me with that sort of point. I fear that he is trying to do that today. I shall not rule on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Monklands, West is an ingenious fellow. He does have the facility to confuse us from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. During the past two minutes, we heard two extraordinary constitutional propositions. The first was that, if a series of Divisions takes place in Committee, members of the Committee should stop debating subsequent amendments, take them formally and dispose of them as rapidly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second proposition was that, if a Committee happened to have among its members people who I readily acknowledge have great experience and knowledge of the subjects that are being debated, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
should mean that rapid progress can be made although some other members of the Committee might not have that knowledge and be new to the subject? Will you confirm, Mr. Hogg, that there is no constitutional precedent for either proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a constitutional expert, I am pleased to be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Codes of practice provide common sense, practical guidance on how to comply with the law and on following the grain of good practice generally. I have consistently stressed both in this Committee and in our debates on the Disability Discrimination Bill. It is important to take employers and service providers with us. We must acknowledge that such provisions place considerable responsibility on those in the business community. It would not be successful without their co-operation. We want to ensure that the requirements of the Bill are made clear to employers through the use of guidance and codes of practice. Employers will want to implement anti-discrimination legislation once they know what is expected of them. I believe that 99 per cent. of businesses will want to implement such legislation once they know what it is for and what they are expected to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Disability Rights Commission would not be the right forum to prepare codes of practice on employment matters. That would neglect the valuable role of existing statutory bodies, particularly the National Advisory Council on the Employment of People with Disabilities. It would be foolish and confusing to risk duplicating work when there is already a body, with established expertise and competence in training and employment matters. NACEPD has advised Ministers on such matters as the Employment Service's code of good practice, the disability symbol and the access to work scheme. Its membership includes some distinguished people, known to most members of the Committee, including Sir Peter Large, Professor Ian Bruce of the RNIB, Mr. Bert Massie—probably all of us know him—and Susan Scott-Parker of the Employers Forum on Disability. The committee has done and continues to do excellent work. Before issuing codes of practice, I would naturally expect the Secretary of State to draw on the expertise of statutory bodies such as NACEPD, as well as consulting organisations that represent the interests of employers and disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of this Bill, would the Minister take advice from the Disability Rights Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A commission established by the Bill would, of course, be able to give advice to NACEPD. That might be a way through some possible difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ignore the role of bodies specifically charged with duties dealing with the employment of disabled people and to reject the years of experience that have been gained would result in guidance and codes of practice that carry little authority or credibility. The amendment and the new clauses would ensure that codes of practice, which will have an important role to play in the implementation of the Bill, were issued by the Secretary of State and would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
make the best possible use of the available advice and expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain why he has decided to restrict new clause 7 to employment issues? Would it not be a good idea if all Ministers who have responsibility for disability matters had a similar power to issue codes of practice? It would thus extend not only to employment in part III but to parts IV and V and possibly part VI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. Perhaps we should return to it later. I put it forward in relation to employment because of the role already played by the National Advisory Council on the Employment of People with Disabilities. An existing body with much expertise, which is widely respected, is able to draw up codes of practice. Although the existence of NACEPD is reviewed periodically—it comes up for review in two years—it makes sense to use its expertise rather than duplicate its work. That is the main thrust of amendment No. 33 and new clauses 7 and 8. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister deals with the amendments by taking them out of context. We do not just want precise dictionary definitions. We are looking for definitions that will help the Bill to operate. We have already encountered the problem of defining disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Secretary of State for Employment might take advice from the commission, but everything that the Minister has said in the context of his Bill and this one suggests that he opposes the setting up of a Disability Rights Commission, and he will presumably vote against it. His Bill does not deal with codes of practice; those are in the hands of the Secretary of State for Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are continually being shifted to the Minister's agenda. He already has his Bill. When he identifies defects in this Bill, he should offer suggestions for improvement that are consistent with the Bill's principles, which are widely supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. Some of us who have been involved in promoting private Members' Bills have been invited to meet Ministers and civil servants and have received the utmost co-operation. Has my hon. Friend had that experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never had co-operation. I must admit that until a short time ago, I had never asked for it, because I understood the divide that existed. Obviously, Ministers have facilities that are not available to Back Benchers. It would have been welcome if the call had come from the other direction, though.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment usurps the role of the commission, even though the Minister said that the Secretary of State for Employment could accept the commission's recommendations. That reflects a difference in perception of the Bill's purpose. The Bill envisages a key role for the commission, which would be free standing and independent, consisting of people from disability organisations. It would have links with Parliament and, through reports and codes or practice, would influence the policy of the present Secretary of State for Social Security or of a future Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
Structures that fruitfully challenge the role of the Executive in democracies are extremely healthy. Our pattern should be pursued. The amendment nudges away at those provisions and sets a different agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman said about the context of the Bill, and that he is approaching it in a particular way. Does that imply that he envisages the abolition of NACEPD, or would it be allowed to duplicate, to some extent, the work of the commission in the production of codes of practice on employment matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be interesting to hear what advice the Minister has received from NACEPD on the matter. It would be in his hands, not mine, to determine whether such work could be carried out by other organisations. Future Governments and Parliaments will have to tackle the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. It would extend the definition of a code of practice to include codes of practice published by the Secretary of State for Employment. As I said in an intervention in the Minister's speech, however, it does not go far enough. The definition should be extended to include all Ministers who have responsibilities for those with disabilities. If codes of practice are to be issued, they should be issued by Ministers who have consulted widely with other parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 3, the Secretary of State has the power to direct the commission. If he can do that on the contents of codes of practice, it would be better if he took over the responsibility for issuing them himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend advanced an interesting argument for widening what I suggested in the amendment and new clauses. Off hand, I am not sure whether I agree with him, but the short debate has ilustrated the problems that can arise from having different bodies that would duplicate functions, as well as the problem that will arise from not being able to issue codes of practice that would be legally enforceable. Such measures will run into those sort of difficulties. It is important that the Committee understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb --> Notwithstanding the wish of the hon. Member for Monklands, West not to hear of such difficulties, it is important that they be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister deliberately misrepresented my view. It is not a matter of my not wishing to hear the difficulties. We have heard them all before, because the matter has been debated so often. The Minister is worried about people hearing about the difficulties, but I want both the House of Commons and the other place to hear them. The hon. Gentleman is deliberately preventing that from happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments were of their usual standard. We have not debated these matters very much before; we may have touched on NACEPD in Committee when we discussed the Disability Discrimination Bill, but we have not discussed the issues at length in any other forum in which I have participated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have illustrated the difficulties that can arise. It is clear that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
does not want to accept the amendment. I shall not press it to a Division, so that we can move on to the next amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 8, leave out from beginning to end of line 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates directly to clause 1, but it relates indirectly also to part II of the Bill, which provides for the Secretary of State to appoint an organisation that will be named the Disability Rights Commission. One of its duties will be to issue codes of practice to provide practical guidance on the elimination of discrimination against disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that the Government do not support the establishment of such a commission. We believe that there is more than one way in which to tackle discrimination. However, the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill seems to require that, of the organisations and individuals that the commission consults to formulate codes of practice, voluntary
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
organisations that represent disabled people should comprise only disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether that provision is unnecessarily restrictive. It is generally out of keeping with the broad manner of consultation exercise to which we have now become accustomed, such as the consultation process that was held last summer on the Government's proposals for tackling discrimination against disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Disability Discrimination Bill will not establish a commission; it will establish a National Disability Council. The duties that we propose for the council would allow it to consult those persons directed by the Secretary of State and anyone else that it wished to consult. I have no doubt that it will wish to consult organisations of and for disabled people as well as those that represent employers, workers and providers of goods, facilities and services—when it considers that appropriate. Indeed, anyone who has an opinion on disability discrimination should be able to be consulted on such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
