	<div class='title'>Meaning of "the relevant pension obligations"</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 318, in page 39, line 36, after "scheme", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"taking account of the amendments which were introduced with effect from the date when employments in respect of which pension rights are earned under the scheme were contracted out under the Social Security Pensions Act 1975".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment, stated at its broadest, is to ensure that the provision made under the Bill for the railway-based historic rights pensions is not so limited as to exclude those changes in the schemes which have to take place in order to meet the requirements of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. The reason the Bill contains a limitation so excluding them lies in the date in subsection (1), which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'the relevant pension obligations', in relation to a B.R. pension scheme, means subject to subsection (3):—

	<ol>
	<li>(
	<i>a</i>) any obligations of the Board which were owed on 1st January 1975".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The effect of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 was to require changes in schemes subsequent to that date. Therefore, a number of obligations have arisen which are not covered by this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take some heart from the Minister's reaction to my contention that the Bill put at risk a number of pension rights. During a recent sitting he said that that was an alarmist view, and he made a number of other suggestions about the contribution I had made. This morning the Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of his Minister, has the opportunity to justify the Minister's statement and show that in drafting the Bill the Government did not intend to produce that result, and that they are now prepared to show that they are not putting at risk or diminishing pension rights with this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main railway pension schemes were
	<span class='label label-info column'>1924</span>
contracted out under the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. This took place with effect from 6 April 1978. Therefore, the pension scheme rule changes made in order to meet the statutory contracting-out conditions occurred after 1 January 1975—the date mentioned in subsection (1)(
	<i>a</i>). This means that the changes do not count as relevant pension obligations, although they relate to the same periods of pensionable service as other relevant pension obligations. Hence, they would not qualify for Government support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to show some of the changes in this category. The first group that I should like to mention is guaranteed minimum pensions, which have to be provided on a basis that would make them equal to pensions that could have been provided under the State earnings-related scheme if it had not been for contracting out. Guaranteed minimum pensions are usually less than fund pensions, although that is not always so. It would appear that, when a pension is built up to a minimum in such a way, the amount of that buildup does not qualify for Government support as the Bill is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is widows' pensions and death benefits that are provided at a minimum level. In so far as provision has been made for them subsequent to the qualifying date, they do not appear to be covered for Government support in this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a series of complicated amendments to the rules governing benefits for those leaving service before retirement age. I do not claim to have mastered all the complexities or to understand every change that has taken place in the rules in respect of those leaving service, but I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be a task of almost impossible complexity to sort out for each individual what would have been paid under the old rules and to take the difference as not being eligible for Government support under the terms of the Bill. One of the reasons for that complexity is that, under the old rules, the benefit might have been taken as a lump sum and under the new rules it could be available as a pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another change which falls within this category is that of contributions payable by members whose pensions have been increased. It is questionable whether that may be taken into account in assessing Government support. Perhaps the Parlia-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1925</span>
mentary Secretary will advise us about that. Under contracting-out legislation, pensions must now be payable from the age of 70 for men and 65 for women, even if employees remain in service after those ages. Those pensions would not qualify for Government support until the employee retired from service if they had to be operated under the rules prior to the contracting-out taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To obtain a contracting-out certificate, it is necessary to satisfy the preservation of pension requirements under the Social Security Act 1973. One change was that if a member had a deferred pension payable from a fixed age and forgot to claim it, he became entitled to it retrospectively, whereas previously he would have been entitled to the pension only from the date when he claimed it. It seems that such retrospective payments would not qualify for Government support as the Bill is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give one more example of the changes that have taken place affecting pension rights which may be debarred from qualification under the Bill. Let us consider the preservation conditions on pensions that have been introduced. Under those conditions if a member leaves and takes a refund of his contributions, and a transfer value has previously been paid into the railway pension fund on his behalf from a non-contributory pension scheme, that fund now has to preserve a benefit in respect of the scheme. This element of the preservation pension would appear not to qualify for support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples that I could give, but I do not intend to do so because I believe that those I have given are sufficient to show that there is a significant number of changes to pension rules which at present definitely give an entitlement to benefit and which would be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important effects of contracting out is that the national insurance scheme is responsible for paying post-retirement pension increases on part of the fund pension. That means that the railway pension funds no longer have to meet the whole of the liability for pension increase, resulting in a saving in the Government support from that source. Having made that saving, it is not unreasonable that the Government should meet the relatively small additional cost involved in supporting the additional liabilities from
	<span class='label label-info column'>1926</span>
contracting-out changes. That is really what the amendment is designed to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further consideration. If the amendment is not made, there will be a substantial administrative burden over the next 50 years or so because each person's pension will have to be subdivided into the part which would be supported under the Bill, which I hope will be the major part, and that which would not be catered for by the support and which in many cases would be a relatively small amount. This would not necessarily be a once-and-for-all calculation for each individual. It would have to be reviewed annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the actuary to the funds has advised that that problem should be avoided if at all possible, not just because of the considerable administrative work involved, but also because of the technical difficulties of determining the unfunded proportion if part of the benefits is to be excluded. That follows because of the nature of the exclusions, which in themselves are extremely complicated and often depend on contingencies upon which it is very difficult to base an actuarial value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are therefore considerable practical advantages in accepting the amendment. The cost would be relatively small and would be far outweighed by the savings on inflation-proofing of pensions which are a direct result of the contracting-out requirements. I therefore hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the amendment, not just as a way of showing the pensioners and those who administer their funds that the Bill is not intended to exclude them from what they now properly regard as pension rights which follow directly from a piece of Government legislation requiring changes in their pension rules, but also to reduce the horrifyingly complex task of having to calculate almost year by year what part of the pension is covered by the Bill and what part is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). With respect, however and indeed a number of others that are likely to be debated this morning, is based upon a slight misunderstanding of what the Bill seeks to achieve. It is important to keep in mind the basic policy of the Bill. These
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1927</span>
are not the Government's pension obligations. They are the board's pension obligations. In the past, these railway pension schemes were either not funded at all or funded in such a chaotic and curious way that in the early 1970s a position was reached in which the board was unable to satisy its pension obligations out of its own resources. Therefore, by two Acts of Parliament, previous Governments took upon themselves an obligation—in effect, a guarantee—to reimburse the railways for their so-called historic obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport explained last week, the Bill does not seek to change that position. We are maintaining, no more and no less, the position undertaken by previous Governments to stand behind the board for various historic pensions obligations. The Bill is concerned only to change the method by which we do that. I believe as firmly as my right hon. Friend that what we are doing in no way changes the position of the Government, the board or the pensioners. Our method achieves what the previous Government's policy did in a way which is much less damaging to public funds and does not involve huge short-term cost as the old arrangements would have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why obligations upto 1 January 1975 are all that the 1978 Act is concerned with. I stress again that we seek to stand behind the board for its pension obligations to the extent that previous legislation did, no more and no less. It follows from that that improvements and changes made after 1 January 1975 in the case of the British Railways Board are not a matter for the Government or for this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1 January 1975 and certainly since 1 April 1978, when the contracting-out arrangements were made, it was for the board to decide whether to change pension rules and entitlements, and to consider the finances of any such change. There is no reason why the Government should take on the additional burden of standing behind the board for improvements that it makes. I think that this matter will recur throughout the morning. Perhaps I have dealt with it generally enough. We shall not guarantee improvements that have been made since the due date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal now with particular improvements to the Social Security Pen-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1928</span>
sions Act 1975. That piece of legislation is longer and more complex than this Bill, but I am reasonably familiar with it—indeed, I led for the Opposition on its Committee stage in 1975. It does not oblige anybody to contract out of the State system. It offers to occupational pension funds the opportunity to contract out if they decide that it is in their interests to do so. By 1 April 1978 the managers of each occupational fund had to decide whether they proposed to contract out of the State arrangements under the 1975 Act. It follows from that that they had to decide, if they contracted out, what arrangements they would make to finance and fund any additional obligations that they had to undertake in order to contract out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure—I do not query its judgment—that British Rail was right, in its own interests and those of its pensioners, to contract out of the 1975 Act system on the due date, 1 April 1978. If it had not contracted out, it would have had to go fully into the earnings-related State system, and it would have had to pay greatly increased national insurance contributions both for itself and for its employees. It is true that it still has post-retirement inflation-proofing from the State, as provided under the 1975 Act. But it contracted out because the balance was wholly in its favour, just as every other private fund tried to contract out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the cost to the State in terms of post-retirement inflation-proofing is, almost certainly, substantially less than the loss to the national insurance fund by way of abated contributions, which are available to schemes that contract out. That is what it was for, and it was a sound and sensible judgment by British Rail to contract out. In order to contract out, it had to comply with the minimum obligations put by the 1975 Act upon contracted-out schemes. If a fund wished to contract out, it had to adjust the rules of its scheme to make sure that it could provide a guaranteed minimum pension. That is what the board did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it from what the right hon. Gentleman is saying, it was discovered that certain widows' pensions had to be introduced, and that in one or two schemes the benefits were below the guaranteed minimum pension which is roughly equivalent to what the State scheme would have provided, and some improvements to benefits had to be made. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1929</span>
all right. British Rail took on that new obligation on 1 April 1978. If it had been a private occupational pension scheme, I should normally have expected some increase in contributions to be made in order to finance the additional obligations. As I understand it, the board did not make an increase in contributions at that stage to pay for the increased obligations. The funds are perfectly solvent but the board made a decision that was entirely its own—by "board" I mean at all times the pension fund managers—that it did not need to fund these improvements. So I gather that it has not done so. That is nothing to do with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are still standing behind the obligations that existed in January 1975. The amendment would add to the historic rail-based obligations Government support for improvements that were made to those pension rights on 1 April 1978. I am sure that members of the board decided with their eyes open that it needed no additional contributions in order to finance those improvements. Therefore it cannot expect to be able, under this Bill, to seek to add yet further improvements to the historic pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise the decision to contract out. It was a sound decision which involved improvements to the historic schemes and I am sure that the board realised that. I understand that they were of a modest order because many pension schemes already provided a guaranteed minimum pension. But they are not covered by these arrangements and I can see no case for enlarging the protection in the Bill to cover them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to say that the argument seems simply enough, on the principle, at least. But as I understand it, the Parliamentary Secretary is saying that these obligations were discovered by the British Rail pension board after the arrangements were—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were not discovered, they were created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, created. But a decision had to be made as to whether the existing scheme would have been sufficient, funded as it was, to be able to meet the extra contingencies. The difference between us, as in our previous
	<span class='label label-info column'>1930</span>
debate, is over whether people feel that the present scheme gives a great margin to meet such contingencies given the extra public expenditure that was planned for these pension schemes by the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference of view between the pensions people, the board and the unions because the present means of funding does not offer the same kind of guarantee. So there may now be much less flexibility to meet contingencies. It may have been thought that they could be met under the Labour Government's funding scheme, but under the scheme being proposed in the Bill there is great uncertainty as to whether that would be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes back to the fundamental question of whether our moving over to an emerging cost basis is as good a support as the previous one. I agree that if that is in question, it is a major policy issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that our method of support is as good as the previous one. But we are talking about extra obligations. I merely correct the language used by the hon. Gentleman to illustrate the position. In discovering obligations that existed previously the funds had to decide after the passing of the 1975 Act whether to contract out. Having decided that, they had to discover what additional obligations they would take on if they did contract out, and then decide how to finance them. That is not a historic rail-based pension obligation. It is a new obligation, based on a sound decision made after 1978. Given our position that the backing that they are getting from the Government will not change in quality or effect, there is no reason why we should add to that backing. If the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are arguing that support is not as reassuring as the previous attempt to fund the pensions, I agree that that is a fundamental difference between us, but it is not an issue that arises out of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two fundamental difficulties here. One arises from a principle and the other from the Government's view about how the schemes can be operated. However, let us begin with something about which I hope that there will be disagreement. Under the 1974 Act the complexities would not have arisen. In the course of the normal working of that Act there would have been no need
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1931</span>
to divide every person's pension each year to see how much of it qualified for Government support and how much did not. This Bill alone gives rise to that enormous administrative complication. There can be no doubt and no argument about that. An enormous administrative problem arises directly from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is further complicated by the contracting out arrangements. It is possible to argue that the Bill should not make provision for anything other than legislative changes in transport. But that would not fulfil what is generally understood to be the meaning of the Government's undertaking that the Bill will not worsen the position of pensioners or of those who administer pension funds. If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to contend that the Bill does not in any way jeopardise or worsen the position of administrators and beneficiaries of the pension funds he cannot insist that the Bill should provide safeguards only in relation to matters covered by previous transport legislation. Even if he did take that view the question of the enormous complexity of the arrangement would remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the gains that the Government made on the cost of living increases in 1978 as a result of changes in the legislation should be taken into account? That is the question he must consider if he wishes the 1975 position to be maintained. To some extent the Government benefited in respect of their liabilities for funding or for pay-as-you-go. The Government and the Minister of Transport want to have it both ways. The reality must be seen in terms of the time scale in which decisions have been taken. The decision to contract out must have been taken by the trustees before they knew that the Bill was on the stocks. It must have been taken before they had any idea that the basis of Government support for historic pension obligations was to be changed. The trustees could not have anticipated the incredible administrative difficulty that has been created for them by the Bill in its present form. That is undeniable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wishes to ensure that the Government will not worsen pension scheme administration he should be prepared to accept the amendment. Even if we leave aside the principle of what the funding is for, the Minister cannot deny that the administrative problem is enor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1932</span>
mous. And it is all for the sake of a relatively small amount of money. We do not claim that there is a great deal of money at stake here either way. When the calculations are made five, 10 or 20 years from now there is a real risk that the amount covered by Government support in terms of the pay-as-you-go contribution and the amount that was covered by Government support prior to the passing of the Bill in paying in of funding may not produce as much in the case of certain pensions. To that extent the funds will be worse off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The administrative point is obviously important. There are administrative problems in separating out the increases where they have been made for contracting out purposes from the original obligations, but they have not been created by the Bill. They would surely have occurred under the 1974 Act because that did not cover these improvements for contracting out. Therefore, for the purposes of calculating funding under the 1974 Act one still has to separate the historical obligation from the subsequent improvement made for the purposes of the contracting out arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, that calculation had to be made as at the time of contracting out, but that is not the point I am making about the complexity. The calculation was made at the time of the decision in the belief that a certain funding by Government was guaranteed and would be paid up to 1986. It is one thing to decide on contracting out in the belief that one has an absolute assurance of a large amount of funding being available to pay for the scheme. It is another matter completely to have to make the decision when subsequently the basis of Government support changes so that a substantial part is in the form of a pay-as-you-go contribution for a proportion of liabilities remaining. That complexity arises directly from the Bill and has nothing to do with the original legislation on contracting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe that the Government's responsibility is unquestionable. They have created that problem with the Bill. For a comparatively small amount of money they can avoid an enormous administrative problem and stay with the spirit and intention of the concept that the Government do not intend to worsen the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1933</span>
position of the pension fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has been basing his arguments on the point that the Bill as drafted will pose greater administrative burdens than obtained under the old system. Even if that were not true, there is no reason why we should not improve previous legislation. I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary may object on one level to an improvement in previous legislation which meant that the Government were putting in more money and making a bigger commitment than had been made in the past. However, in this case the sums involved are quite trivial compared with the administrative burden that will follow from not accepting the amendment. In those circumstances it seems reasonable that the Government should take on that minor additional financial burden. It is likely that more resources will be consumed in making these stupid calculations, recalculations and re-recalculations than would be involved in providing the funding in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems a reasonable piece of inexpensive tidying up and one of our objectives should be to provide everybody with systems and schemes which are administratively tidy, not administratively time-consuming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Parliamentary Secretary unintentionally implying that those responsible for administering these schemes have acted in an irresponsible way by not anticipating that a further degree of contribution would be required to cover a circumstance that they could not have envisaged would arise? I think the Parliamentary Secretary's words will bear the interpretation that the board, if it feels the schemes are not funded as a result of the Bill, should have imposed additional payment requirements on members of the funds when they considered what they had to do to meet the contracting out requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is a fair meaning to put on the Parliamentary Secretary's words he is being grossly unfair. I believe that the people who run these pension funds are conscientious, well qualified, well advised and had good actuarial expertise at their elbow when they made the decisions. They looked at the whole complex proposition at the time and decided that, given
	<span class='label label-info column'>1934</span>
that amount of Government backing, they could run these additional liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that some of them are additional liabilities which were not foreseen. Some of them are small, some are detailed and some complex, but there were restrictions which could be applied within the pension schemes, and were applied, prior to the contracting out arrangements which cannot be applied now. To that extent it was true that minor improvements which were not previously envisaged were made in some people's pension rights. Nevertheless, on an honest appraisal of the finance available under the funding arrangement then guaranteed, the managers thought they could be covered on the basis of existing contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is not amended they may have to take a different judgment at some time, having worked out all these individual complex changes, and decide to increase contributions. If so, the Bill will mean a worsening of an existing pension provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The scheme is now very well managed by extremely skilled and competent people. I was not criticising the 1978 decision in any way. In 1978, in common with others, the managers had to decide whether to contract out. Their next step was to measure the increased obligations that would impose on the fund and then to decide whether additional contributions were required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is by no means the only fund where it was discovered that the effects were so marginal that there was no need to increase contributions. The managers must have known when they made that decision that the Railways Act 1974 would not cover them for these increases. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1935</span>
deciding whether to increase contributions they must have realised that no Government support was forthcoming for these improvements in benefit and plainly decided that they did not need Government support, that they could make the improvements from their own financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
April 1978 was the operative date of the decision—no doubt it was made before then—and the fund managers decided then that they could take on additional obligations without needing to raise contributions or seek Government support to maintain them. The Opposition are arguing on behalf of the managers, and I do not criticise them for that. My argument is that the Bill gives the same Government support. If one accepts that, there is absolutely no case for adding additional obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) argued, in a way that is appealing at first sight. He suggested that as the amendment does not involve huge sums of money when compared with the substantial obligations that the Government face as a result of the previous Acts, we should accept it and improve the pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept the position in respect of historic obligations, I believe that there is no case for taking on fresh responsibility for an occupational pension scheme. I am a firm believer in the funding of occupational pension schemes in both the public and private sectors. Apart from anything else, it is an extremely valuable source of investment and finance for British industry for there to be funded real pensions—not the unfunded; let-us-hope that-the-money-turns-up, pay-as-you-go sort of pensions which are often advocated. Funded pensions are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the nationalised and private sectors it is right that most pensions should be funded by the contributions of employers and employees. If a nationalised industry is relieved of the cost of its pension contribution the real cost of its labour is reduced compared with that faced by another trading organisation that has to meet its pension obligations from its own resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the anomaly of historic pensions obligations, which should never have built up in the first place, which were taken over by Government under the 1974 and 1978 Acts and for which there is not the slightest case for adding to. That should never have hap-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1936</span>
pened in the first place. Governments have had to pick up the bill. Since we are saddled with that by previous legislation and it poses impossible problems—at least £1,200 million in payments will be necessary to try to achieve funding in the next few years—we are changing the method by which support is given. In principle, I see no reason for adding to those historic obligations which should never have arisen in the first place and which must now be dealt with in a way that is most efficacious in respect of the public purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a most remarkable argument from the Parliamentary Secretary bearing in mind that the Government are taking a decision to change the basis on which the public look after historic pension rights from funding to pay-as-you-go. But he has declared himself strongly in favour of funding. It seems to me that if the Parliamentary Secretary believes that, the principle should not change whether the public puts up the money or whether that is done through workers' earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to be fair and neutral on Tuesday evening by making clear that the Opposition were not necessarily attacking the Government for seeking a pay-as-you-go scheme. We were prepared to accept that provided it did not result in a diminution of pension rights. But now the Parliamentary Secretary in defending a Bill that transfers the public's covering of historic pension rights from funding to pay-as-you-go to a considerable extent, says that he believes that the whole thing should be funded, and that if that is not done true labour costs will be distorted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government want the best of both worlds by reducing public expenditure and not facing an inherited commitment after the 1981 assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>

	<p>now covered by support arrangements to pay transfer values in respect of the historic pension rights of members or pensioners, the Government's support does not disappear as a result of the passing of the Bill. There would be no problem in those cases where the transfer values are paid under the rules that existed prior to January 1975, but there could well be cases arising in future where transfer values are payable under amendments made after 1975. For example, the legislation of recent years on the preservation of pension rights has meant that considerable changes have had to be made in the rules governing the benefits payable on leaving service before retirement age. Members have had options to transfer to other pension schemes, and such options could conceivably be granted in the future, particularly in this area of transport, which has so many changing employment requirements between the sections. This could be of considerable importance to the members.</p>

	<p>In fact, even within the area directly covered by the Bill, there is an example of a quite major difficulty in transfers between pension schemes. So it would be quite wrong to inhibit the granting of such options by having a limitation in the Bill which would mean that, if the option were exercised, a measure of the Government's support for that pension would be lost. I will give more examples of transfers that have already taken place which would not be covered by the Bill if enacted without the amendment. Options were granted to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1939</span>
the members of the Great Western Railway supplemental pensions reserve fund to join the modern pension fund as at April 1975. They are not covered by the Bill as drafted.</p>

	<p>Transfers of members of the Great Western Railway supplemental pensions reserve fund to outside employment are not covered. Options granted to members of the British Railways (1974) Pension Fund to join modern railway pension funds as at April 1975 and the options granted to members of the British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grades) Pension Scheme to join modern railway pension funds as at April 1978, are not covered by the Bill.</p>

	<p>I emphasise that the amendment does not seek any additional support in respect of any pension fund member, but seeks merely to ensure that there is no loss of already approved support, because of an agreement that the provision for transfer should be made. If that is not covered by the Bill there is a severe diminution of pension rights. The right to transfer is an important right and I speak with some feeling, because I have been one of those with no right to transfer. I moved my employment from Pametrada Wallsend to Vickers in Barrow, with no right of transfer within the marine engineering and shipbuilding industry of that time. In spite of long and detailed efforts—I have a fat file of correspondence to prove this—I could not effect a transfer.</p>

	<p>When I became an hon. Member there was a transfer provision, albeit of a rather complex nature, which applied to me and I transferred an industrial pension earned many years previously in Wallsend into the Members' pension fund. The transfer right is important.</p>

	<p>If the Minister, with the help of Conservative Ministers, pushes through the House a Bill which denies an existing right he will have worsened in a significant way the benefits of the membership of the railways pension funds. I do not want to stress that point further except to add that I hope that the Minister will accept that if the amendment is passed there will be no improvement of existing transfer rights, but, if it is not passed there will be a diminution in transfer rights, with a worsening of the pension rights of a significant section of the members of the pension funds.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best thing I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1940</span>
can say is that I am trying to avoid repeating what I said in the debate on the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only matter that arises is whether the Bill should provide for Government support for changes made in the rules of some schemes since 1 January 1975 as regards transfer payments. I gave the reasons for our view in the debate on the previous amendment. Changes in the rules made since 1 January 1975 are, no doubt, desirable, well considered and in the interests of the pension fund and its members, but they were not covered by the 1974 Act and there is no reason they should be covered by the Bill. We see no case for enlarging the obligations of the Government. The right hon. Gentleman has found another example of what he regards as a desirable change in the rules of a number of schemes which he would like to make subject to Government support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points arising from that which I should underline. First, it does not seem that the position of the beneficiaries is even remotely adversely affected. The pension funds concerned entered into obligations to the beneficiaries. Presumably there is no way in which the funds can get out of those obligations and I have no doubt that the funds will discharge them. They are obligations owed by the funds, the managers must finance them, as must every other fund manager, and continually bear in mind the actuarial need to keep the fund topped up in order to meet them. There is no way in which the position of the beneficiaries can be changed; they look to the pension fund for their pensions and the fund will meet its obligations, but the Government are not involved and have not participated in changing the rules since 1 January 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely support what was said by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) about the desirability of transferability of occupational pensions. It may be a subject which we have still not got right in the generality of occupational pensions. Certainly, there is no bigger nightmare in relation to occupational pensions than going into the complexities of the law on transferability and trying to produce a satisfactory working system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that I say is disapproving of the fact that a number of British Rail pension schemes continued to be improved, transfer values were imported, and so on. However, as with any other occupational
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1941</span>
pension fund that makes such improvements, they cannot look to the Government for support. They must look to their funds. We accept the obligation pre-existing at 1 January 1975, but we cannot accept an obligation for rule changes made since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments also includes amendments Nos. 320, 321 and 322. I therefore turn to the strange scheme—by which I mean a scheme with unusual arrangements—called the British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grades) Pension Scheme. That is an anomalous pension scheme of a type that is occasionally, though not often, found in the public sector. Although it is notionally funded, the employees make no contributions and the employer is debited with notional contributions that it does not actually make. It is thus, in effect, an unfunded pension scheme with a continuing guarantee by the fund managers that they will meet the obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, in so far as there are historic pension rights in that scheme, the Bill will cover them, as previous legislation covered them before 1 January 1975. Government support will therefore be provided. Because to all intents and purposes the scheme was virtually unfunded, the amount of support that it receives under the 1974 Act arrangements, as changed by the Bill, will be considerably greater than that for other schemes that have substantial assets. Once again, it is a matter of the unfunded proportion. The amount of support for that scheme from successive and future Governments is therefore somewhat greater than for other schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is no case for saying that improvements to that scheme made after 1 January 1975 should receive additional support. Indeed, that is all the more reason why we should hold to the principle that I have enunciated. After 1 January 1975, when this mess had been sorted out and in-service pensions were being funded properly, improvements were a matter for the fund managers and there is no case for Government support of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately refrained from mentioning amendments Nos. 321 and 322 earlier, because I see a considerable difference, with which I shall have to deal in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said. It is surely true that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1942</span>
those two cases a firm expectation existed beyond 1 January 1975 that pension increases could be paid for those grades. However, in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it will be necessary to deal with that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first, however, to the issue raised by amendment No. 320. The Parliamentary Secretary may be right to say that the pensioners concerned will not be worse off, in the narrow sense that if the scheme includes a right to transfer that right is not taken away by the Bill, but surely the Bill has the effect of discontinuing a financial arrangement that existed to pay for such transfers. There will indeed be a continuing difficulty with all the amendments if the Parliamentary Secretary takes the view that unless there was a statutory right established in law by 1974, the Government have no responsibility for funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 1974 the Government worked out with the trustees of the fund a substantial funding arrangement which guaranteed money, and on which the trustees made fair and realistic judgments of what pension benefits could be made available to beneficiaries of the funds. The group that we are discussing are in just such a category. The trustees of the funds, with integrity, good advice and, in my opinion, good judgment, concluded that the transfer values could be covered without any increase in contributions. I shall not quarrel with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that there will be a continuing liability to maintain transfer values, but if he is right, and yet as a result of the Bill that liability is not covered by a funding arrangement, the only way to ensure that it is funded will be to find money from another source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is that money to come from? Will the trustees have to say that in order to keep the transfer values and maintain transfer rights, members will have to pay more money? they may have to say "We no longer have the same funding arrangements with the Government. An Act has been passed that ensures only that such funding as we already have is maintained. A proportion will be covered, and the rest will have to come from a pay-as-you-go system. But we shall not get a pay-as-you-go contribution for that because you did not have a statutory right to it prior to 1974".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is to be the basis of the argument, those who hear it from their pension fund
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1943</span>
managers will find it difficult to take the view that the Government have not worsened their pension schemes. They are likely to take the view that that is exactly what has happened. If we are to use English in the accepted way, we must say that we are dealing with a worsening of the pension fund arrangements in relation to transfers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take amendments Nos. 321 and 322 together. Their purpose is to act in combination to deal with the British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grades) Pension Scheme. The Parliamentary Secretary called it an anomalous scheme. I do not think that it would be of any comfort to beneficiaries of the scheme to be told that it is anomalous. As the Bill is drafted, there appears to be a danger that members of that scheme will lose the benefit of future pension increases for which the Government Actuary allowed in the 1974 valuation. That valuation, which was made on 31 March 1974, assessed the increases at 4 per cent. per annum. The Government Actuary reported on 17 October that he had assumed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the average annual rate of increase in the pension benefits in future for both pensioners and members in service will be 4 per cent".</p></blockquote>
Even after allowing for those increases, the valuation showed a surplus of £1.42 million. The pensions for active members and pensioners were increased by 28p a week. Later in 1974 that scheme became part of the B.R. (1974) Pension Fund. If the funding arrangements under the Railways Act 1974 had remained undisturbed the value of prospective increases in pensions from the British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grade) Pension Scheme would have had to have been taken into account in calculating the amount of funding debt to be prescribed in respect of the B.R. (1974) Pension Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would have enabled the fund to provide future pension increases of 4 per cent. per annum. Such increases were allowed for by the Actuary before any consideration of the Bill appeared on the horizon certainly before the operative date for the purposes of the clause. Indeed, had the fund's investments turned out favourably the members might have benefited to a greater extent than the 4 per cent. per annum for which allowance was made by the Government Actuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1944</span>
However, under the Bill the situation is different. There appears to be no provision for Government support for those pension increases, although support was undoubtedly existed previously. The assets of the B.R. (1974) Pension Fund will be exhausted in the first few months after the Bill becomes law. Once that has happened there does not appear to be any provision under which the Government could make the necessary money available even if a valuation of the British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grade) Pension Scheme showed that a 4 per cent. increase would be justified. That is because such pension increases would result from a rule change after 1975. Anything covered by a rule change after 1975 will be excluded by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly unjust to press the Bill in its present form. The Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny that there was a clear expectation before 1 January 1975 that the increases would be paid. The amendment seeks to restore the position which existed before that date. If the Parliamentary Secretary hides behind the narrow, legalistic approach, saying that if the provision is not written into the statute it shall not exist, he cannot at the same time maintain that he is not taking advantage of the Bill considerably to reduce Government support for the pensioners in this scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the difference between us emerges. The right hon. Gentleman believes that we are somehow avoiding continuing obligations. In fact, we are continuing what is in existence. He says that I take a narrow, legalistic view, but the current position is as defined in the 1974 and 1978 Acts.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) finds that a tempting thought in some of the difficult moments of our debate. If that happened, the board would look for support to the 1974 and 1978 Acts. Those Acts clearly define the extent of the pension obligations that are supported. I resist suggestions to alter the pension obligations as defined by the 1974 and 1978 Acts. We aim to continue the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1945</span>
I do not like being accused of taking a narrow, legalistic view. I have tried to pursue a clear policy of continuing what exists at the moment, no more and no less. Some of the proposed changes may not even be in the interests of the funds if they are achieved. It is possible that payment to someone transferring to another pension could save the fund money. A payment of transfer value may be less costly than paying, years later, the preserved pension rights of the member when those become due. It is debatable in whose interest that lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, if it would reassure the right hon. Member, I should look at the matter again, although I am sure that I am contending the correct case. In that case, we are arguing about nothing. If the transfer value is less of a financial burden than the eventual pension may be, the cost is either neutral or positively to the Government's advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second argument, I still cannot see how improvements to the scheme after 1975 can qualify under the 1974 or 1978 Acts. Therefore, I see no case for including them in the Bill. However, I was interested in one of the right hon. Gentleman's arguments. He said that in the Government's funding obligation under the 1974 Act, the Actuary took account of future improvements in the unfunded scheme. That is a new argument to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if it will help, I shall take further advice on whether, if we had continued to fund, we should have been funding on an actuarial basis that allowed the future improvement of the scheme. If that is the case, I accept that all the words that I have used today could be used against me. It could be said that the extent of the Government's support is being diminished. There is, therefore, a factual difference between us. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman and I had better go away and find out what is the basis of the funding for the scheme. I will therefore concede that if it turns out that if we had continued under the 1974 Act we would have funded improvements under the scheme, we will stand behind them in relation to the 1979 Act, and I will consider what amendments are needed. That is as far as I can go. I will look at both these again. I hope that the Opposition regard that as generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the right hon. Gentleman will agree with me that we are both to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1946</span>
some extent in the hands of advisers on the factual background of the actuarial position. So I suggest that when looking again at the amendments, we act on the basis that we are not enlarging on what is now fact. As long as that point is clear, that we are standing behind only what we would have had to stand behind under the 1974 and 1978 Acts, we are prepared to consider the position. Although my initial reaction to both was that here again was another example of trawling through the edges of the schemes and finding some other desirable improvements which might be tacked on, it is possible, having listened to the right hon. Gentleman, that that is not so. I will have another look at the point, and if it turns out that it falls within the present obligation, or will not enlarge upon it in the case of the transfer values, we will consider it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I leave aside the argument about policy and principle, which is where Ministers and the Government become involved. It is acceptable, if experts from both sides can agree on a technical change, as long as the obligation is not enlarged beyond what it would have been under the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will look again at the second point raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). It was a specific point that I had not heard before and he seemed to be referring to notes when he made it. He said that the valuations for the purpose of the 1974 Act took account of improvements in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the valuations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1947</span>
referred to were not made for the purpose of the 1974 Act, but it seems that we will not resolve that difference of opinion in our debates, because neither the right hon. Gentleman nor I are actuaries and, even if we were, neither of us has seen the actuarial calculations for the 1974 Act. It must be possible both for the fund managers and the Government to find actuaries who will look at the valuations made for the purpose of the funding orders and the statutory instruments under the 1974 Act and at the obligation that would have fallen on the Government to see whether it included future improvements. I think that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned an allowance of 4 per cent. per annum for future improvements after 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could well be that this is an obscure detail in these myriad schemes, but when the experts from both sides actually look up the documents they will be able to find which of them is factually correct and which has made a mistake about the valuations and the basis upon which the funding orders have been made. If it turns out that the funding that was envisaged under the previous Act included an allowance for future improvements in this scheme, we will add that to the obligations under this Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we as an Opposition should make clear what we seek to do. Equally, the Parliamentary Secretary should make clear what undertaking the Government are giving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying that there should be no lessening of Government support for railway pension schemes as a result of the Bill. I understand the Parliamentary Secretary's distinctions, but let us be clear about the categories into which they come. He said that the Government will not give any support which was not guaranteed as a result of the 1974 Act. He said that any support that has come about as a result of anything that happened post-1974, no matter in what form it is guaranteed other than the 1974 Act, is not to be continued. Incidentally, that is not the position under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, the position under the Bill is that the Government accept obligations as they existed at 1 January 1975. This distinction is of great importance to the second amendment. I repeat that a firm expectation existed before 1 January 1975 that the pension referred to in amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>1948</span>
No. 321—the British Transport Commission (Male Wages Grades) pension scheme's pension—could be paid on the basis of that valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuation to which I referred is a fact, not a matter for argument. The Parliamentary Secretary can do as I have done and turn up the report by the Government Actuary of a valuation that was made on 31st March 1974. So there is no argument that it was made in advance of the date in clause 44. The actuary's report said in October 1974 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the average annual rate of increase in the pension benefits in future for both pensioners and members in service will be 4 per cent".</p></blockquote>
That was stated before the date in the clause, so there are important distinctions. We are not merely quibbling about words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments seek to ensure that nothing in the Bill would reduce the present Government support, whether or not it came about as a result of the 1974 Act, other legislation, or discussions between the trustees of the fund and the Minister's Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 321 and 322 cover a much narrower point. We say that a clear and firm expectation existed before 1 January 1975. It is not subject to anything that was agreed after that date, therefore it should continue. If the Parliamentary Secretary checks the actuary's report he will find that I am correct. It contains exactly what I have said. I have not put any gloss on it or attempted to take it out of context. If he accepts that there was a proper expectation on the part of those who administered the pension funds before January 1975, and agrees that that support should be continued, we will terminate our arguments on those amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, on amendment No. 320, we are not on as narrow a point. We are saying that the transfer values to be paid under the schemes will fall into two categories in the Bill. Those provided for in pre-1975 rules will be covered, and those post-1975 will not. We believe that that is anomalous and is an effect of the Bill which we oppose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. Perhaps the best thing to do in respect of the two amendments is to make clear the basis of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1949</span>
our policy, which we are seeking to implement accurately and fairly in the interests of the taxpayer on the one hand and pension fund members and managers on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall be forgiven if someone tugs my coat tails and I have to correct what I am about to say. However, unless I later withdraw my remarks, I shall now give the Government's position. We are not aiming to reduce the Government's obligations under the 1974 Act. However our policy is also not to enlarge on that obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only support that we shall give to British Rail pension obligations is that set out in the 1974 Act. There is no other basis of support. The pensions are the board's liablilities. For the reasons that I have given, the Government have stood behind the board in respect of certain historic obligations. We intend to preserve those, but to change the method by which they are supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In defining the obligations, one has to turn to the 1974 Act. The Bill refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any obligations of the Board which were owed on 1st January 1975".</p></blockquote>
That is the operative date of both the 1974 Act and the Bill in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is not when an actuary carries out a valuation, but what the board legally owes, under a liability to pay. Governments have said, "All right, we shall stand behind you for that liability on 1 January 1975." That has been done. Under that legislation, various statutory instruments have had to be produced to try to fund the obligation, and valuations have been made to determine the amount of funding required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the second amendment. In respect of the 1975 Act, it could be asked whether, when the Government were making valuations of the board's historic obligations on 1 January 1975 those valutions comprised an element for future improvement in the scheme. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that if, in calculating the funding for the purposes of the 1974 Act an element has been allowed for subsequent improvements in pensions on the basis that they are a hsitoric obligation, we shall undertake the same liability in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for my hesitation on that amendment is that it seems that we cannot take it much further this morning because
	<span class='label label-info column'>1950</span>
there is a factual difference between what the right hon. Gentleman is asserting and my understanding of the position. I will check whether under the 1974 Act we were contemplating making payments to the fund which would cover this obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards transfer values, we are in a slightly different area. Any fresh obligations which arise from changes to the rules of any scheme after 1 January 1975 will be obligations which are not covered now, and which we have no intention of covering. It is debatable whether transfer values actually enlarge the obligation on the Government, or are not just a sensible change in its nature. There have been discussions between my advisers and the representatives of the pension fund managers. If they are content to agree that the post-1975 rule changes for transfer values, in those schemes where the values have been introduced after 1975, do not enlarge the extent of the Government's obligations, and that it is sensible for the Government to take them on board, we will do so. I understand that there is a reasonable possibility of agreement between our advisers if they are given more time. I hope that clarifies the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To underline my remarks, I clearly distinguish between the amendment before us and the first amendment that we discussed today. I had far less difficulty in resisting the first amendment because, as the right hon. Gentleman conceded, there was some extension. His hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) intervened to ask why, although it was, of course, an improvement, but only a small and nice improvement, we did not take it on board. I shall continue to resist firmly those categories, and so will the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But where we are talking about the nature of the obligation on the Government, and are not enlarging upon it—the two amendments may both be such cases—it is worth looking at again. I undertake to do so and, with any luck, by Report the whole matter will have been resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"except where such contributions are payable in respect of a period of antedated membership.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is intended to remove an ambiguity in the Bill. It is not the intention that antedated membership of a pension fund should be excluded from Government support, but that could be the effect of the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is centred round the interpretation of the words "the current employment" If the words were held to include the earlier years of service of a continuous period of employment which is still going on, the pension rights in respect of a period of antedated membership—that is, where the employee joined the pension fund after being employed for several years and back-dated his membership—could be excluded from Government support. The amendment seeks to clarify that position. I shall be interested to hear whether the Parliamentary Secretary agrees that there is an ambiguity that needs to be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can deal with the amendment briefly. On reflection, I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there is an ambiguity in the wording of the Bill which should be resolved, because there is no difference of intention between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain British Rail schemes allow members to ante-date their membership and buy service for periods before they joined, and that is a perfectly reasonable and sensible arrangement. I am advised that as the Bill stands the effect would be that although the payments for such ante-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1952</span>
dated membership are made during current service they are not in respect of the current employment, so they would not be excluded. Nevertheless, the wording is not ideal and it is understandable if that gives rise to doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's amendment is not perfect either and if he will not press it we will probably seek at a later stage to table amendments to clarify the ambiguity, probably by placing the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"periodic contributions in respect of the current employment".</p></blockquote>
by the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"contributions in respect of current periods of employment".</p></blockquote>
I give that as an indication of what we shall probably table. Certainly, once we have had a little time to consider the matter we shall table amendments at the appropriate stage designed to clarify the position and meet the right hon. Gentleman's point, which means that antedated membership will qualify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying rapidly to work out whether the alternative wording suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary will fully cover the point. The words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"contributions in respect of current periods of employment"</p></blockquote>
would meet the case if the current period of employment went beyond the period in which a man was a member of the fund and if, it reached back into the total period of employment. I am not clear that that is the case, but if the parliamentary Secretary will confirm that that is the intention at which we are driving, it would be a waste of the time of the Committee if we argued whether we had the phraseology right in our amendment or in that suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) defines what is not to be guaranteed and subsection (3) (
	<i>b</i>), about which we are talking, is intended to make clear that current service obligations are not guaranteed by the Government. In order to make clear in the Bill what the Government are not to pick up I suggest that the wording should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"contributions in respect of current periods of employment".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1953</span>
They would be the contributions due to be paid by British Rail for current periods of employment of one of its employees. That would be present service and the week-by-week contributions now made by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment will make clear that if the board is also making payments for ante-dated service, not within in subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>), they are not excluded from guarantee and therefore if they are historic obligations they can be backed up by the Government. I believe that it will be found that the Government will have met the point. It may be that we shall have to alter the wording slightly before the Report stage if we have it wrong, but we undertake to produce amendments which will attempt to meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand the way that it will operate, in the light of what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary.

We are certainly clear on the result that we wish to achieve and there is no disagreement on that. Therefore, I hope that the aim will be met by words to be inserted in the Bill on Report, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
All staff of the board having historic pension rights are covered by the Bill except those who belong to the NFC pension schemes and are not employed by Freightliners Ltd. That seems to be the meaning of the latter part of paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), and I think that it is anomalous. Subsection (3)(
	<i>e</i>) excludes from Government support any pension obligation where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the body by which it is owed have a right to be indemnified by any other body."</p></blockquote>
In the case of the employees in question the obligation is owed by the NFC or the successor company, and they have a right
	<span class='label label-info column'>1954</span>
to be indemnified by British Railways. Hence, the obligation will be excluded. Subsection (4) removes the exclusion in certain cases. Paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) would remove the exclusion in the present case, were it not for the reference to Freightliners Ltd. The amendment seeks to delete the reference to Freightliners Ltd. and that would, of course, in no way affect Freightliners' staff. I understood that about 400 people who have exercised a right to transfer their employment to British Rail but remain under the NFC pension scheme are affected. British Railways make the payments to those now running the NFC and would have to continue to make payments to the successor company. There would, however, be the apparently anomalous exclusion that these payments, even where they are historic, would not be covered by Government support, irrespective of the date of operation of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that this matter can be cleared up, and that it arises purely from a drafting or technical error, and was not the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a drafting error, and I do not think that I shall be able to meet the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). For reasons which I need not cover in detail, British Rail has acquired a small number of employees—I accept the figure of 400 given by the right hon. Gentleman—who are members of NFC pension funds and also have very long-standing pension rights which are historic under the 1975 definition. Those members and those pension obligations were never covered by the 1974 Act. I realise that I am in danger of repeating myself, but in the last debate I clarified that in the Bill we do not seek to enlarge the support given under the 1974 Act. That Act was necessary because British Railways was not able to meet various obligations towards its railway pension schemes. Therefore, the Government put its support behind those historic rail-based pension obligations. However, in 1974 and subsequently the Government have not put themselves behind every other pension obligation which might be described as historic. I think that some employees have pension rights that are not rail-based or related to NFC. The transport pension world is amazingly complicated. There have been transfers between transport undertakings in the past, and people have carried with them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1955</span>
pension entitlements from previous employers. I am afraid that the board's pension funds have never had any offer of funding from the Government for those 400 men in NFC schemes. We could not, in this Bill, start adding an obligation to meet the cost of them as they emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going back on the debate, this matter comes into the category of the first amendment this morning. Someone has found, among British Rail's pension obligations, some small ones which he would like to add to the 1974 provisions. Unfortunately we cannot accept that. It is a classic case in which Government support is not now given and cannot be offered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised and disappointed at that reply. Bearing in mind your previous ruling, Mr. English, I have not brought to the Committee a copy of the chart I made to enable myself to understand fully the effect of this anomaly. I will, however, attempt to describe the situation as I understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with two types of historic pension rights. In Part I we debated the historic rights which came about as a result of road service. All the people who have such rights are employees of the National Freight Corporation. In part II of the Bill, we are talking about people who have rail historic pensions. Some of those people are employed by NFC and some by British Rail. However, there is a group who are employed by British Rail but who are within the NFC pension scheme. If a line were drawn between those having historic pension rights in the NFC pension fund and those having such rights in the British Rail pension fund, that would not be the same division as between employees of British Rail and those of the NFC. There would be an overlap. Those who are in the NFC pension fund extend into the area of British Rail employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this matter is not covered by the 1974 Act, surely there could have been no intention on the part of this House to exclude those people from Government support. They remained in the NFC pension scheme in respect of historic railway rights for convenience of funding administration, and of simplifying entitlement to pension rights. It was decided when they moved from NFC to British Rail employment that the simplest way of maintaining their pension rights was for British Rail to make payment into the NFC fund. That was the continuation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1956</span>
the employer's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not argue that that is a right under the 1974 Act. I shall argue, most strenuously, that it would be totally inequitable to say that those people should be denied Government support. Both bodies were nationalised industries at the time. Both were providing pension rights in respect of the same historic rail obligations about which we are talking. I see no justification for allowing all the board's staff having historic rights, except those who belong to NFC's pension scheme and are not employed by Freightliners Ltd., to be covered by the Bill. They are employed in two nationalised industries. Incidentally, this House decided to transfer one of the operations of the NFC back to British Rail. There is no reason why people who moved voluntarily from one organisation to work in another in the belief that they could retain their NFC pension rights should now be in a position where those responsible for administering their pensions will not receive Government support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another case of the Bill taking—I shall not withdraw the words—narrow legal advantage of an interpretation of rights to exclude certain pension funds from Government support. We are talking about only 400 people, but the principle is of crucial importance. We are talking about historic pension rights being met by public support. I cannot believe that the British public would wish to exclude 400 people from that support because a mistake was made in 1974 and they were not covered by the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another category will serve to highlight my right hon. Friend's point. Successive Governments put Freightliners under the umbrella of British Rail and then the NFC. A man who started out with Freightliners in the BR pension scheme would be covered as regards historic rights. He would have transferred to the NFC pension scheme, and then back again to the railway scheme. His position would have been subdivided. That man would still be covered and subsidised because he had gone back into the British Rail scheme, whereas a man who stayed in the NFC scheme because, perhaps on grounds of age, it was not worth his while to transfer back, would not be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I cannot answer the question that it raises. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary can. I should like to know whether there was an option on making that transfer. Could some who worked for the NFC in Freightliners and then transferred back exercise an option to transfer into the British Rail scheme and therefore have the support of their historic rights guaranteed? That would be in contrast with others who retained their NFC pension position on re-transfer and who have been covered until now. Surely no distinction can be drawn in principle so that Government funds are used to support one group but not the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However about the 400 people is clear. The only justification adduced by the Parliamentary Secretary for singling out that small group from all the staff of the board is that the 1974 Act did not make specific provision for the payment at present made by British Rail into the NFC fund in respect of those employed by Freightliners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Freightliners has been mentioned let me make it clear that its ordinary staff are not affected here. Freightliners' historic pension obligations were dealt with by the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain whom I consider the 400 people to be. Various people went over to the NFC when it was created in 1968—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary is quite right. I should, of course, have said "those not employed by Freightliners".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four hundred of those people, having transferred to the NFC pension fund, have come back to British Rail. They just happen to have changed their jobs, and have come back to the railways. But because of the transport pension arrangements they have not changed pension funds again. British Rail therefore has about 400 employees with pension rights under the NFC scheme. We are not doing anything against the interests of the staff. They are covered now in the same way as various other British Rail employees are—current service people, for examples—with pension obligations that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1958</span>
the Government are not picking up. Anyone working as a porter for British Rail this week and paying his pension contributions is perfectly adequately covered. There is a fund for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no problem about staff pension rights. We are talking about who will pay for a certain category of staff. Should it be the pension fund or should it be the Government? The Government have not paid in the past. But the right hon. Gentleman is saying from now on they should do so. He draws an analogy between the people in question and those working for the NFC who have historic pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an odd situation to have come about. However, I do not think that one needs a chart—personally I do not use one—to clarify the distinction. I repeat that the distinction depends on which parts of the pensions obligations the Government have agreed in the past to support. In 1974 the Government stepped in because the board had incurred various legal obligations to a great many railway schemes which it was in no position to meet. That was no fault of the current board or its pensions advisors. But years of curious practice had thrown up a bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It started under private enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it started under private enterprise. But it carried on for an astonishing length of time under British Rail as well. In the past it seems to have been a tradition in railway management to run one's pension scheme in the most bizarre possible fashion. All that came grinding to a halt in the early 1970's. British Rail was in no position to meet the legal liabilities. The result was that in 1974 it was necessary for the Government to define those railway schemes that they would stand behind. That was a once and for all process. The obligations have not since been enlarged. There is no reason to enlarge them now. So long as the Government support the historic pre-1974 legal obligations their duty is discharged. The funds can now be managed in such a fashion that they can happily cope with subsequent liabilities. I am sure that they are now so managed. Since 1974 the whole thing has been on a totally different basis. It is a proper, well run occupational pensions fund. It is there to support pensions liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the Government's obliga-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1959</span>
tions in relation to railway schemes. The operative date in the Act was 1 January 1975. The legal liabilities to the railway schemes named in one of the schedules are those in respect of which the Government stands behind British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1978 a similar operation had to be undertaken for the National Freight Corporation. There was a general reorganisation—financial reconstruction is the euphemism that we usually use when nationalised industries are lying flat on their backs in the ditch and have to be pulled out by the Government. That reorganisation involved picking up part of the NFC's pensions obligations. Those were defined in the 1978 Act. Needless to say, they included the Freightliners historic liability pensions as well as a whole lot of other NFC pension schemes. That has been a Government obligation since 1978. It is restated in the Bill. We stand behind those NFC obligations as well as the railway obligations. That is the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the ingenuity of arguing that British Rail can come trotting along again on subsequent occasions—I have no doubt that it was tried in 1978. In 1980, when there is more legislation, we are told, they will come to us and say that because we stand behind the NFC over certain schemes we should stand behind British Rail, who have found 400 people in the same scheme. There is no case for doing that. The British Railways Board does not need support for those people. The obligation for them always fell on the British Railways Board and its pension fund. Everything is perfectly all right. With this amendment as with previous amendments I cannot see a case for enlarging the Government's obligations. That is what we should be doing if we stood behind the historic pensions liabilities for those 400 people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that during my last contribution to the debate I made an error in the last couple of sentences that I uttered. I should like to correct that. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the historic rights of those who moved over from NFC employment to British Rail employment when Freightliners was transferred are covered by Government support. The people about whom I am concerned are those who moved over before that date or moved over in some other way, carrying their NFC pension fund membership with them into British
	<span class='label label-info column'>1960</span>
Rail employment. There are approximately 400 such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no case for the course we advocate he is totally ignoring the nature of the Government exercise when they decided to support the funding of historic pension obligations. There is no doubt that those 400—or at least some of them—brought back with them when they returned to British Rail employment their historic pension rights. What possible justification can there be for the Government's attitude other than the very narrow legalistic justification that it was not written into the 1974 Act? We shall have those words emblazoned on our hearts before we finish debating the amendments. There will be great recrimination against some of our predecessors—indeed, against some of us, too—for our failure in 1974 to have made a terrible row in Committee and say that every single one must be written in, otherwise some future Tory Government will make sure that there is no support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely our predecessors did not intend when they debated the principle of public support for British Rail's historic pension obligations that those with such rights who moved between NFC and BR should be excluded if they did so on one basis but included if they did so on another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary conceded in his statement on Government policy that it was correct for those who moved from NFC to have their historic pension rights supported from Government funds. But should not people who moved on a different basis—that is those who went voluntarily or who filled vacancies in British Rail and kept going a part of the nationalised industry in that way—also be covered? There is a distinction for which I see no merit whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two ironies whizzing about the Committee. The Minister continually commends to our amazed gaze the legislation that was passed in 1974 and 1975, concerning employment protection and railway pensions. Furthermore, I thought that I saw Government Members frowning when we discussed National Freight Corporation pension provisions, and I mentioned that the matter was really nothing to do with pensions and that the Government were merely clearing the decks for a sell-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's attitude in this respect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1961</span>
makes clear that he was concerned about the NFC pensions and their funding only to make it easy to sell the corporation. If he were really interested in the pensions, he would accept the principle enunciated by my right hon. Friend concerning those people whose pensions are, in a sense caught between the schemes, because they have been shifting around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a further indication of the Government's general attitude that, certainly in respect of National Freight Corporation, they do not give a damn about pensions or pensioners. All they want is to make sure that the books are nice and clear to assist in the sale of the NFC's assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being dragged back to part II of the Bill. Although I do not want to answer the point of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) in detail, I should make clear that the position is entirely different. The National Freight Corporation was a funded pension scheme that happens to be in deficit at present, and clearly it is right that that should be first charge on the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter that I should like to clarify in case the hon. Gentleman believes that his point has got home is that there is no dispute between the Government and the pensioners. They are not a party to the discussions about clause 44 because their pension rights exist, will be met and can be financed. Any disagreement is about detail and is between the Government and the British Rail pension fund about who is liable to pick up the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Minister stressed last week to the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), one does pensioners no service by trying to intimate that somehow they are in jeopardy. The argument is between two groups of people, sitting on potentially large sums of money, about who should pay various bits and pieces of pension obligation. They will be paid; the question is simply where the liability properly lies—on the taxpayer or the British Rail pension fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to argue on that basis, and to accept that the passing of the Bill does not, in itself, change the liabilities of those who administer the fund either to its members or pensioners. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>1962</span>
argument is about where the money will come from. If it is to be conducted in that arena, we are faced with British Rail's historic position and forced to ask how it raises the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it really a matter of how the British public pay the money? How does the Parliamentary Secretary see British Rail financing pensions? He says that it is sitting on considerable funds. What are they? The amounts that they have been guaranteed will be substantially reduced as a result of this Bill. I mentioned a guaranteed figure of £900 million. The Parliamentary Secretary talked about £1,300 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail will have to find some way of getting the money to meet its obligation if Government support is withdrawn in respect of the 400 people. It may do that by saying that everyone, whether in this scheme or the other one, will have to pay more money and that the rules will have to be amended accordingly. In that case the burden would be transferred to existing members of pension funds. They would pay instead of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that British Rail will have to find the money anyway without putting up the cost to fund members, in which it would presumably put up fares. Then the British travelling public would be paying through fares what they are now paying through taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are other possibilities. At some time in the future on the collapse of the funds British Rail pension trustees will come to the Government and say, "The funds have collapsed as a result of the Bill that was passed by Parliament in 1980. We said at the time that we had the gravest doubts. Will you now cough up some money to get us out of this mess?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be the arena in which the Parliamentary Secretary wants to discuss the transfer of responsibility for funding but it does not help to deal with the Opposition's concern about the administration of the funds and the way in which pensioners are supported. If the Parliamentary Secretary, wants the argument conducted in that way, I appeal to him to tell us where those who are running the funds will find the money to pay for the schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a paving amendment to make the way clear for amendment No. 326. The purpose of that amendment is directed to the provision in the Bill that appears to make it possible for the Minister to use a surplus in one section of the British Railways superannuation fund to offset a deficiency in another section. This is because the British Railways Superannuation Fund (Amalgamated Sections) constitutes a single fund in law, although the constituent sections, which correspond to the former main line railway superannuation funds, are treated for the purposes of actuarial valuations as being separate funds. This is in accordance with article 8 of Statutory Instrument 1970 No. 477. The statutory instrument is in good clear language and its meaning is in little doubt. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those provisions, applicable to the existing funds, which relate to actuarial valuations and payments by the Board to secure the solvency of the funds shall cease to take effect on the amalgamation date.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board shall make such payments to the amalgamated fund, in addition to any other sums which are due to the amalgamated fund, as shall be certified
	<span class='label label-info column'>1964</span>
by the actuary of the fund to be necessary to provide from the amalgamated fund the benefits prescribed by the rules of all the sections of the fund.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>For the purpose of determining the payments required under paragraph (2) of this Article,"</p></blockquote>
that is the paragraph I just quoted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"each section shall be considered separately and a surplus in one section shall not be offset against a deficiency in another section."</p></blockquote>
I think that the meaning of the statutory instrument is clear on that point, but if matters need further underlining it continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of paragraph (3) of this Article the part of the LNER section of the amalgamated fund which relates to persons admitted to the London and North Eastern Railway Superannuation Fund before the 1st June, 1957 and the remaining part of that section shall be regarded as separate sections of the amalgamated fund."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the reason for these provisions is that when the former main line superannuation funds were amalgamated in 1970 it was on the strict understanding that if the members in one section were in a relatively favourable position they should not lose that benefit by having their surplus diverted to meet deficiencies in other sections. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that that position is preserved, otherwise there could be a danger that in determining the unfunded proportions under the Transport Bill the Minister could value the British Railways Superannuation Fund (Amalgamated Sections) as a whole and thereby utilise the substantial surplus that existed in the case of the LNER section in respect of members admitted to the LNER Railway Superannuation Fund on or after June 1957 towards reducing the deficit and hence the Government support for the other sections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is clearly the case of a position established many years ago with the clear intention that those who entered into the agreement on amalgamating the funds did so in the belief that at no time in the future
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1965</span>
would the surplus of one fund be used to benefit others and thereby deprive people from the benefits accumulated in the fund. Admittedly, that was many years ago and I make no comment on what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary about funds being badly run or run in strange and bizarre ways at that time. I do not claim to know sufficient about the matter, but it certainly seems that, whoever ran the LNER fund—even if that was done in a strange and bizarre way—must have run it in such a way that it resulted in a fairly substantial surplus and, thereby, the fear that upon amalgamation part of that surplus would be transferred to the funds of other sections entering the amalgamation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is clear that an assurance was given at the time. It has been honoured by those who run the British Railways scheme, and we want to make absolutely sure that the law is crystal clear and that the Minister cannot go against that intention. We also want to make sure that in five or six years from now nobody will say of us what the Parliamentary Secretary said of those who in 1974 failed to write a guarantee into the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want an absolute guarantee. Our intention is to honour an assurance given many years ago and written into a statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on the vigour and enthusiasm of his speech about the so-called amalgamated sections of the pension fund. However, I accept what he said. As the Bill stands it is undoubtedly unclear whether the various schemes within the so-called amalgamated sections will be treated as separate schemes. After listening to the right Gentleman I can understand why those responsible for administering the schemes are worried about the possible effects on the support they receive. Therefore, I accept what was said by the right hon. Gentleman and shall not try to challenge it. I make clear that the Government's intention is that these separate schemes should be treated separately and that we should make that clear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the proper place for the amendment is in clause 50 by way of a paving amendment to schedule 8 which lists the various BR pension schemes. I am also told that there is a slight dispute over the drafting of the present amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1966</span>
ments, but I undertake that as soon as this morning's sitting is concluded we shall table Government amendments to clause 50 and schedule 8 which will seek to achieve the effect aimed at by the right hon. Gentleman's amendments. I do not seek to challenge the validity of what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In light of previous unhappy experiences this morning I do not want to look a gift horse in the mouth. But quickly looking at the sections referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, clause 50 seems to define the schemes covered and schedule 8 to list them. Therefore, I do not fully understand the mechanism—which is now the agreed purpose—by which matters are to be achieved. I tabled the amendment to the section that bears on the Minister's powers in relation to determining the proportions liable and the obligations covered. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether that is so and why operating on clause 50 and schedule 8 apparently can have the effect of limiting the Minister's power in determining the proportions to be allocated between the various funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I entirely follow that question so I shall reflect upon it. In clause 44 we are dealing with the definition of the relevant pension obligations which the Government will stand behind. Subsection (6) upon which the amendment bears, clarifies what is meant about particular obligations on particular schemes. I think that what matters with the schemes in the amalgamated section is whether the obligations should be regarded as arising in the case of each scheme separately or whether they are all to be treated as one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman made clear in his speech that if they are all treated as one it is possible that the Government will have the advantage of the surplus in one scheme to offset the deficit in another. The Government have no such nefarious intention. Therefore, we have to make clear that in defining the obligations—and these are set out in clause 44(1)—there are six separate schemes. Out amendments will set out the separate schemes and make clear that they all stand apart in their own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will be tabled forthwith so we will be able to deal with them in Committee. If the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are not satisfied
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

with them, they will be able to debate and challenge them again, and ask the Government to consider yet another attempt before Report. We will seek to meet the points that are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I see the mechanism now, whereas I may have been slow on the uptake previously. I see that he proposes to define the schemes as separate schemes in clause 50 and then list them as separate schemes in the schedule. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has reflected conflicts of principle and policy between us. The principle was debated in part on the previous clause, and on occasions the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the fundamental difference that exists. It is a fundamental difference of policy which perhaps he felt makes no different to what it guarantees for the pensioner. We must accept that we are discussing fundamental differences of principle and effect between what is embodied in the 1974 financial reconstruction of pension schemes for historic pensions and what is embodied in this Bill, which was launched in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been a debate on the detail. I can recall listening to experts during the past week who spoke of the different categories of workers who seem to be caught between the various schemes or belong to organisations that have moved out of one State corporation into another. Freightliners seems constantly to be shifting from point to point. That company has developed the concept of the merry-go-round for one of its pensions. Perhaps it had another thought about the merry-go-round as its pensioners shifted from one body to another creating arguments, difficulties and precedents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Misery-go-round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>—and perhaps even misery as a consequence of the interpretation of the Bill for pensioners in those organisations who belong to the historic rail-based pensions, but not the majority, who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1968</span>
already covered by the present, accepted and funded pension scheme. The Minister has made clear to us that the two principles that govern his approach when considering whether to accept our amendments are a desire to see that the pension funds were treated no better or no worse than in 1974 and a belief that the system that we are now employing in the Bill to fund the historic pensions is no worse and no better than that applied in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second principle, there is a fundamental difference, not only between the two sides of the Committee but on the part of the advisers outside the House, who may be described as vested interests, whether they represent the unions, the trustees on the board, or the boards of the companies. There is undoubtedly a difference of view between them. As far as I am aware, the only party taking a different view are the Government, and they have not prayed in aid the opinions of another body to support their belief that this fundamental change in no way makes the situation any less secure than the principles embodied in the funding arrangements of 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary, even on his own text, has seen that in these amendments there may well be a case on those narrower areas and narrower grounds for considering an amendment along the lines we propose. A further period of reflection will now take place and with it, perhaps, another change, in line with what the Committee as a whole wishes to see happen, namely, that the position of the pensioners is no worse than at present. We are all agreed on the objectives. The means by which to achieve them are what cause disagreement between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a philosophical difference between us as to how to fund historic pension schemes. There is no doubt that the continuing schemes will be funded in the way that we understand occupational pension scheme funding to operate at present. No one disagrees with that. Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary said that he was wedded to the idea of funding pension schemes in that way, and that it was by far the best. The only difficulty is that it is not embodied in the historic pensions arrangements. If he agrees with that and thinks that that is the best way, he should not be repealing what we put in the Acts of 1974 and 1978. But perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1969</span>
he agrees in spirit if not in practice. Perhaps he was influenced by that famous "Panorama" broadcast recently about Ministers getting first and second chances. It may have been an 
	<i>Evening Standard</i> report. I am not sure which influenced him the more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend made clear that the argument for or against is not the real issue between us in Committee. We are concerned solely to see whether changing the principle will create greater insecurity and whether the pensioners and trustees feel that there is less security, which may lead to a deterioration in the benefits for those who are and will be receiving these pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claimed that there was no difference for the pensioner, that the liability would clearly not be on either the Government or the British Railways Board. We base our argument on the fact that that leads to certain difficulties, that these insecurities may be realised, that financial commitments may become more difficult to meet, and that, as a consequence, the pensioners' benefits may be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on the amendments the Parliamentary Secretary allowed his political prejudice to come through. I do not condemn that. Why should not he have prejudices as a politician? I have many. He spoke of Governments having to move in and bale out the nationalised industries when they fall down, but I can think of a number of private companies, which encountered financial difficulties, although I do not want to press that sore point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was always assumed that the pay-as-you-go principle would apply to nationalised industries and to public bodies. Governments of both colours have benefited from not facing up to their obligations to fund these pensions. When each Government determined the financial obligations of nationalised industries, the whole issue of pensions must have been relevant. Through the 13 years of Tory rule, these arguments must have been prevalent. The problems of funding and financing British Rail have been the lot of all Governments. To that extent, a decision was taken by Government not to tie themselves into massive capital reconstructions—until 1974 when a Labour Government grasped the nettle. They said that it was right that the pension fund
	<span class='label label-info column'>1970</span>
should be funded, and that the best form of security for pensions was to separate them from the company's industrial activities. That decision was made and £1,000 million was considered to be the right commitment for funding the scheme. The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary argue that although the Government are now saving over £1,000 million, there is no need to worry because there is the same security. The Opposition do not believe that, nor do the administrators of the fund. More important, those people who the Minister says he is most concerned with, the recipients of those pensions, do not believe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand why. Even if one could predict what the inflation and wage rates will be in 20 years' time—to make such a judgment is what the economists call moonshine—and assuming that one got it right, what concerns the pension authorities, and others concerned, is that the Minister will make his decision without their advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claimed that there will be no difference between the position now and what happens in 1981 when he makes a judgment on the proportion he intends to contribute to the unfunded historic pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he will consult the authorities involved. That is not in the Bill. The Minister will say that it was not in the Bill of 1974. But there was a letter from the government in 1977 making absolutely clear that there would be consultations and agreement with all parties involved. That is one of the essential differences. They were assured of agreement when the assessment was made. If the Minister wants to go as far as the previous Government, but no further, he should send a letter to all concerned saying that agreement will be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is argued that if the judgment is wrong and British Rail cannot fund these financial benefits they will have to default on, or reduce the benefits for those with historic pensions. Other workers, however, who are lucky enough to be on the funded pension schemes will have their pensions maintained. There will be a difference in pensions which will cause difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those, and other, reasons we look forward to a change in the powers contained in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1971</span>
two sides of the Committee which will have to be explored—this could be described as a debate on part III stand part—on whether what we are advocating on funding now, or for meeting emerging costs, provides the same support for the board and, therefore, its pension funds, as did the previous funding arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly correct that in the course of the debate I revealed—I have done so many times during the debates on pensions in which I have taken part over the years—that I am a great enthusiast for the funding of pension schemes both in the nationalised and private sectors. That is the real way to guarantee pension funds and their beneficiaries that there is real money available to meet whatever emerges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case I shall just deal with the accusation that what I say is inconsistent with the Bill. In such dealing with pensions that I have had I have never previously encountered the present situation, which I used rather scathing language to describe. We appear to have index-linked
	<span class='label label-info column'>1972</span>
pension obligations built up over a long period for which there is no fund provision at any adequate level. Previous Governments took upon themselves the obligation to endeavour to build up a fund. In recent years funding index-linked pensions on a final salary basis has been comparable to running up a down escalator. Unfortunately in 1974 the Government put themselves at the bottom of an absolutely huge escalator and there is no sign of them ever getting to the top without unacceptable burdens. We had to make special arrangements and emerging costs is clearly the most sensible method, as was recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause defines the obligations which the Government will support, and I recommend that it stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
