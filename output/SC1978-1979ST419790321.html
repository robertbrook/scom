	<p>10.33 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Harry Ewing)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Legal Aid (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) Regulations 1979.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if at the same time we discussed the other regulations:
	<br><blockquote><p>Legal Advice and Assistance (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) (No. 2) Regulations 1979.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Legal Aid and the Legal Advice and Assistance (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) Regulations are part of the package of improvements in the financial conditions for civil legal aid and advice and assistance to which I referred last November during the debate on the annual increases in legal aid and advice financial limits, and about which the Lord Chancellor gave details in another place on 8 February on Second Reading of the Legal Aid Bill. As hon. Members will probably know, the corresponding regulations for England and Wales were approved yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will share my pleasure in being associated with these regulations which make significant increases in the various financial limits and will allow many more people in the lower and middle income groups to take advice on legal matters and to undertake legal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Legal Aid (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) Regulations increase the lower disposable income limit—that is the limit above which one ceases to be eligible for free legal aid—from a disposable income of £815 to a disposable income of£1,500. The term "disposable income" means the income which is left after deductions have been made for tax, rent or mortgage or other necessary expenses, such as travelling to work and allowances
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
for dependants. The regulations also increase the upper income limit, above which one ceases to be eligible for legal aid, from a disposable income of£2,600 to£3,600. The lower capital limit—that is, the amount of capital which a person is entitled to have without having to make a contribution—is increased from£365 to£1,200 and the upper capital limit, above which a person would not normally be entitled to legal aid, is raised from£1,700 to£2,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Legal Advice and Assistance (Scotland) (Financial Conditions) (No. 2) Regulations increase the eligibility limits for legal advice and assistance from a disposable income of£52 a week to£75 a week, and from a disposable capital of£365 to£600. Other regulations which have been laid, but do not require approval by the House increase the lower limit, below which a contribution is not payable from£25 to£35 a week and make consequential amendments to the scale of contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that in assessing a person's disposable income, certain allowances are made for dependants which, for this purpose, includes a spouse. These allowances are currently aligned to supplementary benefit rates, but a further two sets of regulations which have been laid, and do not require approval of the House, will increase these allowances, for both legal aid and legal advice and assistance, so that they will be 50 per cent, above the appropriate supplementary benefit rates for the particular dependant. This will be of considerable help to parents with children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity has been taken to simplify the regulations relating to the assessment of resources by incorporating some allowances in the new limits and adjusting others. This simplification should remove the necessity for interviews by the Department of Health and Social Security in a large number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is difficult to make accurate estimates about the proportion of the population eligible for legal aid because the limits relate to disposable income, which of course varies according to a person's commitments and family, it is clear that far fewer people are now within the scope of the scheme than when it was first introduced. The increases which are made by these regulations and the others to which I have referred are intended to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
recover that lost ground. Over 70 per cent, of the population should now become eligible and well over 30 per cent, of households with two parents and two children should not be required to pay a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the question of contributions made towards the cost of civil legal aid, as hon. Members will know, a Bill which is at present before the House will enable my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to reduce the maximum contribution payable by those persons whose disposable income is above the free limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations, together with the others which I have described and the Legal Aid Bill, will quite clearly be the most significant improvement in the legal aid scheme for a considerable number of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.39 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are obliged to the Minister for introducing the regulations, which we welcome, and for the terms in which he announced them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister one question at the outset. Has he any estimate of how much this measure will cost in local terms in a year? I know that it is a difficult sum to estimate, but it would be useful to know it. However excellent a cause for spending money, it is important to remember the cost of making beneficial proposals. Perhaps I should declare an interest. In theory, I might be a recipient of some of the aid given to others if the computer which enables legal aid to be paid is ever remanned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that when we discussed this matter before, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Rifkind) and I expressed considerable anxiety about the regrettable fact that in civil causes legal aid was available to the very poor, that the law was available to the very rich from their own resources, but that there was an enormous gap in the middle and that people in that category, who resorted to law in any form were heavily penalised. Therefore, the law, which should be equal, is very unequal, because some can afford to litigate without care of the cost or result whereas others dare not litigate at all, win or lose. That is an unfortunate characteristic of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I welcome the fact that the figures that the Minister has given us will restore the position which pertained when the legal aid system was introduced. Is he able to be rather more specific? I am not entirely satisfied with the words "recover lost ground". Do the Government estimate that we shall return to the precise position of 1949 when legal aid was first introduced? Is it the Government's intention to bring in annual orders? If not, what is the Government's estimate of the percentage of people who will drop out of the category into which we are replacing them with an inflation rate of, say 10 per cent.? The Minister may not be able to give us these figures, but these considerations should be borne in mind when considering the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter, which the Minister will recall I raised on a previous occasion, continues to give me great cause for concern, because it is not removed by raising the capital limit from£365 to£1,200. If, for example, a nurse, postmistress, teacher, retired lawyer or retired politician, who has modest savings of£1,200, is knocked down by a motor car when crossing the road, he or she will discover that to recover damages it will be necessary to risk those life savings. Such a person will not be granted legal aid because of the possession of disposable capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought it unfortunate that a person's modest capital should be set against legal aid, whereas a person who has been spendthrift and saved nothing or who has put his money into an annuity or pension scheme—in other words, saved it in a different way—should be eligible for legal aid. If a retired district nurse lives in the country and has a motor car, her motor car will be her capital. If she is a careful person and has looke dafter her Mini, for example, it may be worth more than£2,600. She would probably have to sell her car. The Minister agreed with me previously that that would be terribly unfair. I hope that the Government will seriously consider altering the capital concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should somebody who has considerable capital receive legal aid? Considerable capital will provide considerable income. A person in receipt of such an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
income will probably be ineligible for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consideration of these modest amounts of tangible assets which can be equated as capital should not disentitle people to receive legal aid. Equally, if they go to law and are granted legal aid, they should not have to surrender such capital to contribute to the legal aid system. That is a great wrong that is morally indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that we are not being churlish. We are raising a matter of great importance to many people. It is one that I believe will not be the subject of dispute between persons of any political view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the increases and hope that they will alleviate the anxieties of those who have the misfortune to have to go to law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.46 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Dempsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask my hon. Friend the Under Secretary to comment upon another anomaly that occurs with legal aid in Scotland. I welcome his lucid explanation of all the improvements in the provision of legal aid service in Scotland, but I can never get away from the anomaly of the two worlds of legal aid. There seems to be one world of legal aid in criminal courts and an entirely different one in civil courts. I have mentioned this time and again, because I am unable to reconcile why this should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will be aware that in the past I have drawn attention to a trial involving a person with an income of£500 a week. The legal aid service found that trial very costly. Yet an individual of that standing was able to obtain free legal aid because it was a criminal case. But in a civil case involving, for example, a woman, the victim of a deserting husband—I have such a case in mind—with earnings of£20 a week is asked to pay£60 towards the cost of legal aid services in trying to obtain a judicial separation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, that is a very unfair operation of legal aid services. It means that the most well off receive free legal aid while the least well off have to make substantial contributions. The lady to whom I referred had to pay£10 a week
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
out of her earnings of£20 for a simple legal aid service of that nature. To satisfy myself that the scaling was correct, I referred the case to the Lord Advocate, who courteously and kindly replied confirming that was the scale then in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation has been improved as a result of the statement made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, but the principle remains that there is a much less generous approach towards the provision of legal aid in civil cases than in criminal cases. I would be grateful if my hon. Friend would comment upon that matter when he replies to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) was right to point to certain inadequacies in civil procedure, but I should point out a major difference between civil and criminal cases. In every criminal case the person receiving legal aid has not initiated the proceedings. He is the accused person. The proceedings which are taken against him are of the volition not of himself but of the prosecuting authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main advantages of the Scottish legal aid system over that south of the border is that an accused person, irrespective of whether he is found innocent or guilty, is not expected to make contributions towards the cost of the proceedings. I believe that to be right and proper. If the State wishes to bring a prosecution against a citizen, it is right that the State, not the accused person should pay for the costs of that prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what was said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn). But I wish to put one question to the Minister. Before doing so, I congratulate the Minister unreservedly on the very generous increases in legal aid provision over the past three or four years. We, and, indeed, Labour Members, have pointed again and again to the gross inadequacy of legal aid in Scotland. Therefore, I am delighted that the Government —albeit at this late stage—have responded in such a comprehensive fashion by giving very full increases in a way which will reverse the grave and unacceptable decline
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in entitlement to legal aid that has taken place over many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, as a result of these provisions, the Government hope that entitlement to legal aid will now be available to 70 per cent, of the population. What attempt will the Government make to ensure that the public are aware of these generous increases? The Committee is not exactly over-burdened with representatives of the press, so it is unlikely that massive publicity will be given to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a wide awareness in the public, as a whole, that it is not worth applying for legal aid. It is assumed that there is either no entitlement or such a minuscule entitlement that it is hardly worth bothering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, these changes will make a substantial difference. There will be a large number of people for whom, until today, it simply was not worth while contemplating legal aid, but who now will do so. I hope that, having introduced these regulations, the Government will not wait for the public to respond. Every effort should be made to ensure that the public are made aware of the different situation which will prevail from now on and that for the great majority it will be worth while considering legal aid if they are contemplating taking proceedings of any kind. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.52 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) for the generous reception that they have given to these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the hon. Member for Pentlands said, that both sides of the House have worked hard—certainly in the past four years during which I have been responsible for this function—in trying to extend legal aid to many more people than have been eligible hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire said about recovering the position in 1949 is important. At that time it was estimated that 70 per cent, to 80 per cent, of house-
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
holds in Scotland were covered by the legal aid scheme. Although the low capital limits would exclude many households, it was still estimated that between 70 per cent, and 80 per cent, of the people were eligible for legal aid. We hope to improve on that figure. We have worked hard. As I expect to be the Minister in charge of the matter for some years to come, when I come back to it next year I shall take account of what the hon. and learned Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was said about capital is also important. I take the view that a person who has saved during his working life should not be penalised in retirement. The upper capital limit of£2,500 is not an absolute limit. The Supplementary Benefits Commission has discretion to grant legal aid in cases where the capital is still above£2,500. However, I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's general criticism. Clearly, as years pass, we shall hope to do something about that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the cost of agreeing to these regulations. The cost at 1978 prices—this was allowed for in the Chancellor's last public expenditure survey— is£600,000. Clearly, that figure has to be uprated to take account of the slight inflation that has taken place between 1978 and 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie spoke about the contribution that has to be made in divorce cases
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie referred to the contribution that must be made towards civil legal aid in divorce cases. The regulations are much more generous in this respect. The kind of case about which my hon. Friend was talking—I do not want to be held to specific terms—where the disposable income is only£20 a week, would certainly fall into the category in which little or no contribution would be made to the cost of legal aid, if it were granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pentlands was right about the difference between criminal and civil legal aid in Scotland being quite marked. There is considerable guesswork—I think that the lawyers opposite would agree with me—in the granting of criminal legal aid. No one knows precisely how long a trial will take, what may happen in the middle of the trial,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
whether the accused person may change his plea to guilty, and so on. There is a whole host of imponderables in granting legal aid in criminal cases compared with civil cases. We have two different systems in Scotland. A committee grants legal aid in civil cases but the court itself grants legal aid in criminal cases. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie will understand that these regulations are much more generous and will cover the point that he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point that I wish to make was rightly raised by the hon. Member for Pentlands. It concerns the need to give publicity to these regulations. Obviously it is not enough for Members of Parliament to discuss them in a Committee in which there is no press representation and it is certainly not enough to publicise them only among lawyers. Unless people know that the facilities are available, they are not likely to take advantage of them. I undertake to speak to the Scottish Information Office about
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the possibility of giving the regulations more extensive publicity than hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee will now agree to accept these regulations. Again, I express my gratitude to those who have attended the Committee and taken part in the debate. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Campbell) for attending this morning and backing me up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
