	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will remember, Mr. Gourlay, that when we adjourned on Tuesday, I was suggesting that these were very important amendments, because they would delete the words "unreasonable" and "other relevant circumstances". The amendments are fundamental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should begin with an apology to the hon Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), because I promised that I would quote extensively from two articles, and you, Mr. Gourlay, were interested in hearing them. I intend to use them, because they are relevant, but the hon Gentleman has explained that he is also on the Committee considering the Fisheries Bill, and, since he helped to defeat the Government there, who am I to encourage him to come back here? At least there are signs of life from the hon Gentleman when it comes to fishing, if not on these other important subjects. After all these sittings, I thought that if I quoted from the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> the 
	<i>Scottish Sunday Express</i> and 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> I might be guaranteed a line in tomorrow's papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman wrote in the 
	<i>Scottish Sunday Express</i> that we should have legislation to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Curb the power of crazy councils to pay for Socialist extravagances out of the poor ratepayer's pocket."</p></blockquote>
[Hon Members: "Hear, hear."] I thought that that would get a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman wrote in the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It's true my solution would remove some of the freedom from local authorities. But they would still keep the most important freedom of all—to spend their block grant as they thought best within certain general guidelines."</p></blockquote>
That is the key phrase—" within certain general guidelines."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I really want to draw attention to is the hon Gentleman's article last week in the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This week in Parliament we were discussing Scottish rates."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
I have yet to hear the hon Gentleman discussing anything in this Committee. I do not want to elaborate on that, because he is not here, but I find it a wee bit cheeky to suggest that " we " were discussing something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now discussing three amendments of fundamental importance to clauses 13 and 14, the two most important clauses in the Bill, dealing with how the Government can control local government expenditure. I have already quoted the Secretary of State, who made it clear that he regarded these two clauses as the most important in the Bill. He was tackled by one or two hon Members, and, in referring to clause 14, he made a point about making a notional assessment of the rate poundage of an authority. I would like the Minister to explain what is meant by that. The Secretary of State made clear that he had in mind grafting additional powers on to the powers already available to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will make a great debating point of what Attlee did in 1948, but the matter is too serious for such points. I want to know exactly what the new powers are and in what circumstances they might be used. I said earlier that it was understandable that on Second Reading everyone concentrated on this part of the Bill, and not on the rating and valuation aspect. I am not complaining. The Minister said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We. are considering here not powers to prevent local authorities determining the level of rates but the extent to which central Government should be able to decide how much money they give to local authorities. To suggest that it is improper or illegitimate for central Government to do that is so naive and out of touch with reality and the practice of the last Labour Government as to be neither credible nor objective."</p></blockquote>
The hon Gentleman seemed to be establishing the point that the Government would not tell a local authority how much money it could spend; they will merely cut the grant to that authority. Perhaps the Minister will explain that. The hon Gentleman went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is one major difference between this Bill and the previous legislation it lies in the selective nature of the powers provided. We do not apologise for that; on the contrary, we are proud of it. The local authorities prefer it to the bludgeon that the right hon Member for Craigton used when he was Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
So again the Minister is establishing that this will be a selective weapon, which has not been at the disposal of previous Governments. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only significant difference between the provisions in the Labour Government's Act and the provisions in the Bill is that under the Labour provisions the local authority had to have spent the money before the grant could be withdrawn. In our case we propose to act on the budget for proposed spending."</p></blockquote>
We have now established that the Government are seeking powers. 1 am asking what is reasonable and in what circumstances those powers will be used. They will be new powers, which will determine the amount of grant paid by the Government to the local authorities. They will not affect the right of an authority to increase the rate contribution or to increase its expenditure. The weapon is that the Government will be able to cut the grant to the authorities, and to do so on a selective basis, which is virtually impossible under the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was asked a question by his hon Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram). Goodness knows what will happen if this provision is successful, because if he does not have the opportunity to rant and rave about Lothian he will have to think of something serious to talk about. I am sorry that he is not here. The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South asked whether the powers would be sufficient to prevent local authorities that are determined to spend excessively from doing so. Of course, he is right. There is nothing in the Bill that can veto a proposed rate increase by the local authority. … In Scotland, once it has fixed its rate it has no power to fix a supplementary rate. If, as a consequence of its excessive and unreasonable proposals, it loses an equivalent amount of rate support grant, the authority would penalise its ratepayers without having a single extra penny of resources to make available for its excessive and grandiose schemes."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 9 December 1980; vol. 995, c. 1332-35.]</p></blockquote>
We are entitled to an explanation from the Minister of how this will all work. I concede that there was a bit of a noise in the House when the Minister was replying. I am not criticising him, because I believe that these were pretty clear statements of Government's intention. Our amendments go to the crux of the issue of giving the Government the additional powers that they think they need, to be able to do the things that the Minister has promised the legislation will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses have been most helpful. The note on subparagraph (ii) says that this is to deal with a situation before the expenditure has been incurred. The previous legislation came into play only after the incurring of "excessive and unreasonable" expenditure, the very words to which our amendment relates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Excessive" and "unreasonable" are longstanding words, but to the best of my knowledge the powers have never been used, albeit—by chance, no doubt— they have been carried over by two previous Labour Governments. Although the debating point might be made that Labour Governments in the past had these powers, they never needed to use them, because they were always much more reasonable in their dealings with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It disturbs me to see the way in which the power is spelt out. I find it quite frightening, and it will not be very encouraging for the future relationship between government locally and centrally if the Government proceed with these powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have another go at understanding just how this will operate. I am not straying, Mr. Gourlay, if I refer to the note on clause 14. I am sure you will accept that the words "excessive and unreasonable", which are the whole basis of the amendment, are really the guts of the clause, and in some way the mechanics of the operation involves clause 14 coming into play. It does not make sense to look at the amendments without looking at the background to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the note on clause 14, the power of the Secretary of State is to be extended
	<br><blockquote><p>"to cases where an authority's estimated expenses taken into account in fixing its rate are in the opinion of the Secretary of State excessive and unreasonable."</p></blockquote>
Again I come back to the word "unreasonable". The note also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State has been advised that he may only exercise this power where an authority fixes a rate which is intended to bring in revenue surplus to requirements."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
I know that this is a very technical matter, and I want to be fair. I am assuming that the present powers— I am arguing that the Government have not yet made out a case for extension of the powers—come into play only when an authority is budgeting for a surplus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Clearly, the hon Gentleman is compelled, in supporting his argument on the amendment, to go a little wide, and I have allowed that to happen. But it appears to me that the hon Gentleman is now going into a very wide argument about the use of powers and so on. The amendments are really discussing the words "unreasonable and excessive" and "financial and other relevant". I think it was agreed that we would keep the discussions on the amendments to a technical character, and not widen the debate into a clause stand part debate. Otherwise, it will be the duty of the Chairman not to allow a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that completely, Mr. Gourlay. You are in the Chair, and it is never wise to argue with the Chairman in any Committee. But I suggest that we cannot make a case on the deletion of the word "unreasonable" unless we put forward arguments as to the "other relevant circumstances" in which the Secretary of State would use these powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair, I think that the hon Gentleman will concede that the question he was asking really arises out of clause 14, which has to do with the resources element. None of the amendments before the Committee deal with that. I shall be happy to answer his particular points when we deal with clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but we are in a technical difficulty. I am not complaining. We are discussing the deletion of certain words which I am sure both you, Mr. Gourlay, and the Minister will accept are the crucial words in this clause, and they are related to the assessments made under clause 14. The Minister is shaking his head, but that is for him to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had better not stray any further into clause 14. But as I understand it from the notes on clauses and the introductory notes on the rate support grant, which apply to clauses 13 to 17, there is a reference to the needs element, which I should have thought was related to the use of the word "reasonable". It is in those circumstances, the "other relevant circumstances" that the Secretary of State will need to make up his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments give the Minister an opportunity to explain just how this provision will work. He is seeking additional powers, and the Committee and those in local government in Scotland have the right to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give some examples of what I think might happen and to clarify one point on housing. The Minister said that nothing in these powers would affect the housing support grant calculations in 1981-82. My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) questioned him on that. He asked whether that meant that every year we could exclude housing from those powers, and the Minister was not very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
clear about that. I ask him to repeat what is the basis for excluding the housing calculations in 1981-82 but leaving a doubt about future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely indicated that the Government were satisfied that for the forthcoming year it would be inappropriate to include housing expenditure, which comes under housing support grant, in any question of whether the rate support grant should be withdrawn. It may well be that we would come to a similar conclusion for future years. But I simply indicated to the hon Gentleman's hon Friend that I did not feel able to give an absolute, binding assurance to that effect. As his hon Friend himself indicated, one Minister cannot bind his successors, nor should he try to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that clarification, but I should still like to know under what circumstances the powers would apply to housing support grant calculations. As I understand it, all the references are to rate support grant. I know that we are dealing with a very involved subject, and I am always grateful for any enlightenment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I suggest to the Minister the kind of examples that seem to me at the moment to be covered by the existing powers, which would make it sensible to accept our amendment? I may get a line in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> tomorrow if I quote from it—though there are more reports of the National Executive of the Labour Party than there are of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is more interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of opinion. Certainly, this Committee is more important to everybody, rather than the gossip that we read, even in the reputable papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has just announced that he is refusing permission to spend £11.6 million less than planned on capital. That is done under an existing power. I am not arguing whether it is the right decision. I am merely saying that the power is adequate to control the capital expenditure of local authorities, in housing and indeed in any other service. I am not speaking for my party, but—I reckon that there is adequate control by central Government, exercised in a reasonable manner, on capital expenditure in local authorities. Therefore, Mr. Gourlay, our amendments are certainly relevant here. I would argue that the powers are not necessary and that, therefore, our amendments could be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman reads what I said on Tuesday he will appreciate that I specially excluded loan charges, which are the repayments due as a result of capital expenditure, from the estimated expenses which the Secretary of State would be obliged to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: am trying to eliminate some of the very points that the Minister has already made to find out just why we need the powers. I am agreeing with the Minister. Not only is this excluded, but in any case the powers are adequate to control it. Whatever the battle that is going on with Lothian region on
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
capital, the provisions, as the Minister has just confirmed, seem to be adequate. So the new powers will not apply to these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in passing that it was a bad day for the Conservatives when the editorial in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is really extraordinary how this Government's spending axe is wielded so often and so hard on capital projects and thus on the Government's friends (or ex-friends) in the private sector. The construction industry must by now be regretting that it escaped friendly Labour nationalisation."</p></blockquote>
There is a real concern on the capital side—but I admit that I am straying now, Mr. Gourlay, so I shall go on to the relevant matter now. We have found that the provision is not to do with capital expenditure —that, in local authority in general and in housing in particular, the controls are adequate, however objectionable they might be, because the resources are not there from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn again to 
	<i>The Scotsman,</i> and a report of what the Government want to do about teachers. This is relevant to the amendment because, if we are not dealing with capital, we are clearly dealing with the other expenditure of local government. The hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) expressed great concern about the Government's inability to tie up the revenue expenditure of local authorities, but he may make his own speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the crux. The Minister will argue, as he has already done, that certain items are to be excluded from the calculations, and he has quite properly drawn me up on the one about capital. Therefore, we are talking about wages and services. As I understand it, that is what the additional powers are sought to do something about, and that is why our amendments are relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will take Lothian, because those are the figures quoted in 
	<i>The Scotsman.</i> I am not arguing the EIS case or anybody's case about whether the Red Book standards are acceptable, but according to the Red Book the Government say that Lothian region has 1,200 extra teachers that it does not need or should not have. At a rough guess, we are talking about £10 million of expenditure. Is it the Government's intention to say that that expenditure is unreasonable and excessive, that that £10 million can be spent, but that they will take £10 million off the central Government grant? That is what the powers seek to do, if I have got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with fairy stories here. We are dealing with a Bill which, even with the speediest progress through the House, will be pushed to get Royal Assent before the end of the financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman should know by now that we are discussing the amendment, and that when the Bill receives Royal Assent has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the use of the powers to which the amendments are directly related has something to do with the timing, Mr. Gourlay. I am not trying to be difficult or to abuse the time of the Committee, but it really is a relevant question to put to the Minister. I am asking him specifically what he thinks the Secretary of State will consider is unreasonable expenditure. That is relevant to the amendment. Therefore, in order to save time, I am asking the Minister quite specifically
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
whether this is the kind of expenditure that he or the Secretary of State would regard as unreasonable. That is certainly relevant to our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am being quite specific. I am sorry that the reporters from 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> are not here, but we cannot always arrange these matters. I assume that Lothian will overspend on educational salaries by £10 million a year. That is a guess. Will that be regarded as unreasonable expenditure, or how much of it will be regarded as unreasonable expenditure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the real point of what I am trying to get at, the timing, and how the power would work. Let us assume that the Secretary of State says that he has to decide whether this is reasonable expenditure before he brings these powers into play. We are asking him to explain or delete " unreasonable " because we do not think that it is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the figures are, but let us say that the budget of an authority, the net expenditure, excluding the aspects that the Minister has referred to, is in simple terms £100 million. The Secretary of State decides that £10 million of that is unreasonable expenditure. Does he then just dock £10 million from the central grant which the authority was due to get? How does it work, and what does that mean? Does the authority have to borrow money? How does it finance that expenditure which is not now attracting the grant of £10 million, £5 million, or whatever it is that the Secretary of State is to dock from the central Government grant? He has said that there is nothing that can stop the authority putting the burden on the rates; all that these additional powers can do is to reduce the Government grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which authorities does the Minister think might now be incurring unreasonable expenditure? They are all at the stage of having their budgets prepared. We are almost into February now, so the Scottish Office and the officials must have some idea by now which authorities will be affected by judgments under clause 13, in the lines that we are seeking to amend. It is perfectly legitimate for us to speak to the amendments, not only to get some information from the Minister about the mechanics of how the clause will work, but to discover which authorities he hopes to catch out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of this is important. It is a major change in the relationship between central and local government. The Minister will not deny it, though he will justify it. What consultation has there been? Is this fully and properly understood by the authorities? Have they accepted these words "excessive and unreasonable"? As I understand it, no parliamentary approval is required. Am I right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister can tell me the part of the Bill that deals with that matter. If, in the circumstances which I have outlined, he wishes to dock £10 million from the Government grant to, say, Lothian region, where under the new powers is it shown that that requires parliamentary approval? Will these deductions be shown on the rate support grant order and the report that goes along with it, when that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
ultimately produced to Parliament in the normal way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, Mr. Gourlay, that I have not annoyed you unduly. I think that on the whole my remarks have been relevant; I hope that they have been reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Garscadden said, having looked at the dictionary, that either of the words "excessive" and "unreasonable" could be used in certain circumstances. I suggest to the Minister that while the wording may not be all that different, the intention in the future is a major change for local government in Scotland.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to do two things. They seek to remove the word "unreasonable" from the earlier part of the clause, and to remove the words "and other circumstances" that appear several lines further on. The simple effect of the amendments, if they were accepted, would be substantially to widen the discretion of the Secretary of State. It would mean that he would have a much lesser standard to have to satisfy himself by before he was able to withdraw rate support grant from an individual authority. I suspect that that was not understood, or certainly was not the intention of the Opposition, in tabling the amendments, because it is clear from everything they have said that they wish to reduce the possibility of the Secretary of State being able to exercise these powers, whereas the sole result of the amendments, if they were accepted, would be substantially to increase the power of the Secretary of State at his own discretion simply to withdraw the rate support grant. I am sure that that is not the intention of the Opposition. Now that that is appreciated, I presume they will not wish to pursue these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says that the expenditure must be "excessive and unreasonable" and that regard must be had
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the financial and other relevant circumstances".</p></blockquote>
These phrases were not thought up by the present Administration nor by those drafting this Bill. They appeared not only in the 1966 Act but in the Act passed under the Attlee Labour Government, and, indeed, in the original legislation passed in the late 1920s. These are terms which have been used in successive Acts of Parliament. Although the Opposition are quite correct to say that the Labour Government did not use these powers, they re-enacted them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon), who was responsible for the passage of the 1966 Act, defended these terms when the Standing Committee at that time was considering them. It is not sufficient to say "We never used the powers. Therefore, it does not matter what we meant in introducing them into legislation." The fact is that the Labour Party was asked specially to approve them in 1946 and in 1966, and seemed happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have a great admiration for my right hon Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Mabon). I agree with the need to have the powers.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite happy to go on and explain why we have chosen to continue with the same phrases as the Labour Government used—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same phrases—not the same powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. RifkindM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. If they were same powers the Bill would not be before the Committee. That is self-evident. But we have continued with the same phrases, for very good reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious that in his relationships with local government the Secretary of State should be fair, If it had been our desire that he should have completely unfettered discretion, without any form of external or objective test, it would have been in the Government's interests to drop the words "unreasonable" and "other circumstances". That would have given him a much more unfettered discretion, but, as I have indicated, we wish to be fair with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction is as follows. First, there is no legal definition of "excessive", and there never has been, but it implies that the level of expenditure as measured against a particular standard is in excess of that standard. In other words, the sum which the local authority wishes to spend is more than the application of a particular standard would suggest is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were simply to use that word, and no other, it would mean that where a local authority was indeed spending above the level that a particular standard would suggest was appropriate the Secretary of State was obliged to use his powers—even if the difference was very small indeed, even if it was a marginal difference between what the standard would suggest was an appropriate amount of expenditure and the amount which the local authority was proposing to spend. Including the word "unreasonable" helps to deal with that situation, because, of course, the Secretary of State has not the slightest desire or intention to act against an authority simply because in a strict technical sense it could be said that its expenditure was excessive, if the sums involved were very small and had no significance as regards the Government's national interests and the general level of total expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is to provide a more sensible balance where a local authority's expenditure might rightly be
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
considered, according to a certain standard, to be excessive, if it is not unreasonable, in that the sums involved are relatively small. That is the sort of circumstance in which it is much more sensible to require that the "unreasonable" criterion has to be met as well as that of "excessive".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) specifically asked why the words were "excessive and unreasonable", not "excessive or unreasonable". The Secretary of State has to be satisfied that both conditions have been met before the requirements of the legislation are met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown) raised the question of staffing in education, and gave as an example the fact that it has been alleged that Lothian has 1,200 teachers above the standard. Would not the Minister agree that it is unreasonable for a Secretary of State to impose standards that are not acceptable to the authorities that are asked to provide the service in the first place? Therefore, he is using yardsticks to determine what he thinks are the reasonable levels of expenditure that are not acceptable to those who are required to carry them out, because the Red Book standards were never accepted by the local authorities but were forced on them by successive Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is jumping ahead to a different point which I intend to deal with when we consider the words "excessive and unreasonable". If he reads the clause he will see that that relates to the total estimated expenses. We are talking about whether the total estimated expenses are excessive and unreasonable, and therefore the question of individual services, of teachers' salaries or of any other individual component is not strictly relevant to this aspect. But I shall come to the question of individual services later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are concerned with and what the Bill is concerned with is whether the total estimated expenses of the local authority are excessive and unreasonable, and I have been indicating why it is right that there should be a broader standard by which to judge that than merely that of whether they are excessive. I hope that I have indicated the sorts of circumstances which would justify the wider term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also deals with later words in the same sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"regard being had to the financial and other relevant circumstances".</p></blockquote>
One of the amendments would remove the words "other relevant circumstances" so that the Secretary of State would have to take into account only the financial circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain the sorts of circumstances which would be relevant although not, strictly speaking, financial. The financial aspect clearly would comprehend the area's rating resources and rate poundage. But these might not be the only appropriate circumstances which a local authority would wish to take into account. May I give examples of other relevant circumstances? We could consider the extent of the area, the sparsity or density of the population, the incidence of urban deprivation, the number of clients for the major local authority circumstances such as education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
and social work, prospective oil development and so on. These are not, strictly speaking, financial circumstances but most would agree that they are relevant in coming to a judgment whether proposed expenditure is excessive and unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a better job of this than 1 did. He is addressing his mind to the questions that I asked and he will see now what I was getting at. But are not all these factors already covered? That is the point on which I was being drawn up by you, Mr. Gourlay. Are they not covered in the existing calculation of the needs element of the rate support grant in any case? Is it just that there is no opportunity to vary them? I am not making a party point, because this is an extremely difficult question. The Minister said, in an inelegant phrase, that my right hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan) used a bludgeon. It is the lack of sharpness in the rate support grant, as I understand it, that the Minister is trying to overcome. Why are the new powers necessary when all the relevant circumstances that he has mentioned are precisely those mentioned in his notes on the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman were correct, not only the new powers but the old powers would not be necessary. If would have been just as illogical to withdraw rate support grant after the expenditure had been incurred as it would have been on the basis of proposed expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain why I think that the hon Gentleman is wrong and why both the old powers and those before the Committee are not unnecessary for the reasons that he has suggested. The rate support grant, as the name itself suggests, is a grant which the Government pay to support a particular level of expenditure. It is the percentage of relevant expenditure which the Secretary of State has taken into account, and the idea is that, for a level of expenditure of which the term "relevant expenditure" indicates the sum, the Government will pay for the appropriate percentage— 68.5 per cent, or whatever the figure is at a particular time—of that expenditure. If the local authority intends to spend, or actually spends, an amount substantially greater, both the previous legislation and the present Bill accept that it is right and proper in certain circumstances for it to have a degree of rate support grant withdrawn on the basis that it was given to support a particular level of expenditure, and not a level significantly above that if it is thought to be "excessive and unreasonable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a new argument. That is clearly the basis on which the 1966 Act, the 1946 Act and the other legislation were put forward. That aspect has not changed in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I revert to the question of
	<br><blockquote><p>"financial or other relevant circumstances".</p></blockquote>
There will be no disagreement in the Committee that, even if the purely financial circumstances of the local authority might have suggested that the proposed expenditure was "excessive and unreasonable", there may be other factors, such as sparsity or density of population, the likelihood of future oil development, or other matters of that kind, that would lead to the conclusion by a reasonable person that the proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
expenditure should not be considered excessive and unreasonable in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is a narrowing of the Secretary of State's discretion, because these are matters which he must have regard to. They are not discretionary. It does not say that he may consider these or he may take these into account; he must take these into account and it is only right and proper that that should be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon Member for Provan and his hon Friend the Member for Garscadden raised the particular question of whether the Secretary of State would wish to look at the individual expenditure on specific services provided by a local authority, whether he would be looking to see how much it spent on teachers' salaries, on leisure recreation and so forth, whether he would first do that and then decide whether, in the light of his conclusions, the expenditure should be considered as coming within the terms of these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may say so, I think the hon Gentlemen have it the wrong way round. The Secretary of State is not interested in the detailed decisions of local authorities where the aggregate of their expenditure cannot reasonably be considered to be excessive and unreasonable. In other words, if the totality of their proposed spending is not excessive and unreasonable, he will not in any way wish to look to see whether, despite that, it could be said that individual components of their expenditure would, if looked at in isolation, fulfil those criteria. That is not his objective and there is no question of him acting in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, we are dealing with an authority where the Secretary of State comes to the view that the totality of proposed expenditure is excessive and unreasonable having regard to all the appropriate circumstances, then of course in order to justify that, to explain his reasons for coming to that conclusion, it will be absolutely necessary for him to indicate his reasons, and that means looking at the actual details of the authority's expenditure; if he fails to do that, he will be quite rightly criticised for coming to an arbitrary decision without having explained the basis of his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already indicated—this was another point made by the hon Member for Provan—that the procedure that would be likely to apply and, indeed, in some respects is required by the statute, is that first, if Secretary of State comes to the view that the proposed expenditure of a local authority is excessive and unreasonable and that rate support grant or a proportion of it should be withdrawn, what he would propose to do would be to intimate that to the local authority concerned, with his reasons —not just as a bald statement of fact but with his reasons—to give them an opportunity to comment on those reasons and to make representations to dissuade him from so acting. If, as a result of these representations, the Secretary of State is still of a mind to use those powers, then, in terms of section 5 of the 1966 Act he must lay an order before Parliament in order to get approval. So there would be both the opportunity for the local authority to make representations and ultimately the power of Parliament to decide, and without the approval of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
Parliament it would not be possible for such an order to be approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that whole operation, it is of course necessary, not just desirable but absolutely necessary from any standpoint of fairness, for the Secretary of State to testify to his reasons for having come to the conclusion; that inevitably means that he must look at individual items of expenditure. I do not mean minute items but ithe classes of expenditure in various categories as they affect the local authority concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been very helpful in explaining this, because this is precisely what I was asking about the mechanics. Where is that power given or where is he seeking that power which will require the Secretary of State to lay an order, and what is the parliamentary procedure? I presume it will be a kind of supplementary rate support grant in reverse—that is, power to deduct something from an authority that it would otherwise be due, as he has explained. Though I am not making a great point of this, if there has been public discussion with the authority, I presume that that kind of information will be included in a report along with the order or somewhere in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon Gentleman will consult section 5 of the 1966 Act. Those provisions are named in section 5 and even after amendment, section 5 will say, that the Secretary of State.
	<br><blockquote><p>"after affording the local or constituent authority in question an opportunity of making representations, may make and cause to be laid before Parliament a report stating the amount of and the reasons for the proposed reduction and setting out any representations made by the authority with respect to the proposed reduction; and if the report is approved by a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament the Secretary of State may reduce the element of the grant accordingly."</p></blockquote>
Those are the terms of the 1966 Act. They are not affected by the amendments. Therefore they make it abundantly clear that, in terms of the statute, the local authority will be entitled to make representations. It will be consulted beforehand and, if the Secretary of State still feels obliged to make such an order, not only the order and the reasons for it, but the local authority's own comments on the proposed order, must be laid before the House of Commons in order that consideration may be given to them, and only after approval would a grant thereby be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman and the Committee will see that this is not some swift, arbitrary act of confiscation from a local authority which can be operated in an indiscriminate way. Not only do the statute and the proposed amendments lay down the criteria, and not only have we resisted what, on the face of it, are the Opposition's attempts to widen the discretion of the Secretary of State; we also maintain the very proper opportunity for a local authority to make its representations and its position known before any decision is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one other point which I need mention at this stage. The hon Gentleman asked what consultation there had been on the proposed powers. The Secretary of State and I had a whole series of
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
meetings throughout the last year with local authorities. The first thing that we wished to ascertain from them was their general reaction to the proposals which were being implemented for England and Wales on the block grant system and whether they wished to see such a change in Scotland. They indicated without qualification that they did not see that as being appropriate. We made it clear at the time that if they did not wish to see Scotland move in that direction, the Secretary of State would have to consider improving his selective powers, which he did not wish to do, but that that would depend on the actual expenditure decisions of individual local authorities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accepted the views of COSLA that it would b± inappropriate in Scotland to apply the block grant system that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has proposed for England and Wales. But, as it were, the quid pro quo of that was that, in the light of the failure of a number of authorities in Scotland to respond to the repeated requests of the Secretary of State to modify their expenditure in the national interest, it was felt appropriate to bring forward these proposals. So these were not brought out at the last moment. The convention was told on numerous occasions that, if the actual expenditure was not brought substantially below that provided for in the budget, it was inevitable that the Secretary of State would seek to improve his selective powers. Indeed, the Bill is a consequence of that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have dealt in some detail with the points raised by hon Members of the Opposition. Given the consequence if their amendments were to be accepted, I have no doubt that they will hasten to seek to withdraw the amendments rather than put them to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of my contribution is a quotation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not wish to be thought to quibble, and I am certainly not pursuing this Amendment to the length of a Division, but it seems to me on reading the paragraph that the words "and unreasonable" are not necessary. One should not use unnecessary words in public general Statutes, because of the latent danger that some distinction may be read into words which may give a different intention from that which Parliament thought and meant.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As I understand this Clause it is to give the Secretary of State power to reduce the grant payable where there has been excessive expenditure. The words used are 'excessive and unreasonable'. My only point is that if expenditure has been excessive and so as to justify the exercise of the powers contained in the Clause, the expenditure must be unreasonable. It is accordingly not necessary to write in the word 'unreasonable' as well. If it is so excessive as to justify a reduction in the grant payable and to be quantified in that way, it must have been unreasonable expenditure.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>No doubt the argument against this is that an expenditure can be excessive without being unreasonable and if we took out the word "unreasonable" we would be giving the Secretary of State power to give a grant which technically is excessive although minimally so. If that is the legal advice of the Under-Secretary, I will ask leave to withdraw this Amendment."—[

	<div class='membercontribution'>: beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 6, line 25, after "unreasonable", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or that the local authority on the basis of the said total estimated expenses will fail to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of their functions".</p></blockquote>
I rise after a long period of silence, encouraged by the news that we are acting graciously on this side of the Committee, an endorsement of our standard of etiquette which I am sure all my hon Friends will find thoroughly reassuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an amendment of some substance and one which we regard as being of great importance. Put in the simplest terms, it would try to bring into the scope of the new punitive powers authorities which are not spending excessively or unreasonably, as interpreted by the Secretary of State of the day. It will not always be the right hon Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger); it will not necessarily always be a member of the Conservative Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event the idea is to bring within the scope of these new sanctions not just the high spenders, not just the extravagant and the profligate, but also those authorities who are spending meanly, who are spending too little and who are failing to carry out their statutory duties, or failing to provide a reasonable standard of services to their electorate. I believe that this is a reasonable and important amendment. I say quite freely that I think it is drafted in a way which would not be acceptable. That is often the case with Opposition amendments which are important, and there is no point in hiding that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day I think it would probably have been better if we had included not just the form of words on the Amendment Paper, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the local authority on the basis of the said total estimated expenses will fail to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of their functions."</p></blockquote>
We should probably have included at that point some words about a local authority or joint board "which has failed" to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be in the present tense, as well as in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite clearly, if this amendment were accepted, we should have to follow it by consequential amendments to the latter part of clause 13, in particular at the top of page 7 in the present Bill when we are dealing with new subsection (1A). The present text reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining, for the purposes of paragraph (c) of sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
section (1) above, whether, in relation to any year, total estimated expenses of a local authority are excessive and unreasonable".</p></blockquote>
Then it sets out the criteria to be applied, the very controversial criteria which we shall be debating in the sittings that lie ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to expand the new punitive sanction to include low-spending authorities that would have to go in. It would have to have some words such as these:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether in relation to any year a local authority or joint board has failed to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of its functions, or"—</p></blockquote>
as the clause at present states—
	<br><blockquote><p>"total estimated expenses of a local authority are excessive and unreasonable".</p></blockquote>
The extension would have to be built in to the criteria clause, the new subsection (1A).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the form of words in the amendment may not be perfect and that further amendment may be required. Having said that—I am sure the Minister will accept the point—it clearly expresses an intention. There is a point of principle behind this amendment which, speaking for myself, I would be keen to urge upon him. We will listen with interest to see whether he gives us any encouragement about coming forward with a better form of words on Report, or at a later stage of the Bill's progress through either House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important. I really feel that it is more than just a probing amendment, or an amendment put forward just to allow a debate about general principles, to obtain from the Minister some further indication as to how clause 13 will work in practice. It is an attempt to change clause 13 radically by extending the range of the Secretary of State's powers to ensure that they cover a much wider scope of possible local authority conduct.

It may be of help if I start by explaining exactly what we have in mind. This is not, as I say, just a matter of sniping. Occasionally, I have put down amendments—here I bare my soul—I have occasionally put down amendments that border on the frivolous where I have no intention of pushing the argument to extremes, but they are part of the general skirmishing process that one always finds in a Standing Committee. But this one certainly does not fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my hon Friends—I hope I am not standing on anyone's corns—that I am rather tried of hearing the ritual obeisance to the apparent reasonableness of this particular Minister. It is a myth to which I do not necessarily subscribe. I hasten to reassure him that in terms of his future career he can be as unreasonable a Right-wing beast as the next man, although he may do it in a somewhat muted and uncolourful fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not appeal to him on behalf of this amendment on grounds of his reasonableness or unreasonableness. I do it purely and simply in terms of the reasonableness of the proposition that we are advancing and I have a childish and touching faith in the power of reason. Ultimately, if one keeps plugging away with good ideas, on the random process one will occasionally be accepted. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
the logic of what I am about to argue will find favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon Friend been given an assurance that some important amendment will be accepted that has prompted him to make these flattering remarks about the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows how words can be twisted and misunderstandings can arise. My definition of the word "flattering" is obviously very different from my hon Friend's. All I can say is that he obviously takes a jaundiced view of Conservative Ministers because if my remarks have been flattering they can only have been flattering in the context of an extremely gloomy view of the ability of Conservatives to respond to reasoned logic, social justice, equality or any of these other characteristics which we would like to see built into legislation that is going to affect the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I should turn to the substance of this amendment. The genesis is section 5 of the 1966 Act, and we are all familiar with that. The Committee will recall that the 1966 Act gives the Secretary of State certain powers. It states that if the Secretary of State is satisfied
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the expenditure of any local authority or joint board has been excessive and unreasonable, regard being had to the financial and other relevant circumstances of the area or areas concerned",</p></blockquote>
he can take rather unpleasant punitive actions on that basis. We have been spending a great deal of time discussing whether we should change the way in which that power should be operated and whether the timescale should be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter that we will be debating at great length, but the important point about the new powers is that they deal with that section, which is section 5(1) 
	<i>(b)</i> of the 1966 Act. It states that we should allow the Secretary of State to push his punitive powers on the basis not of outturn figures—that is, waiting until the end of the year in which the fiscal sin, or the alleged fiscal sin, has been committed before the punitive machinery rolls into action— but that the Secretary of State should be able to set these punitive powers in motion at the beginning of the financial year on the basis of estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retrospective nature is being diluted and the powers are being made prospective. That is perfectly clear. I do not say that it is a laudable intention. I do not think that it is a justifiable intention, but the effect is quite straightforward and could be understood by anyone. In fact, Mr. Gourlay, I am thinking of offering a small prize for the first member of the Committee who talks about stable doors and bolting horses in connection with this particular concept. No cliche will be left unturned by the Minister to support the rather shaky edifice of his legislative intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I believe that the remarks which the hon Gentleman has just made would be more appropriate to a clause stand part debate than to the amendment which he is moving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of transgressing, Mr. Gourlay. That was an aside which I will not follow up. I certainly hope that my main theme was in order,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
because I was explaining what the clause does, which was entirely relevant to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause extends the criteria of section 5(1 
	<i>)(b)</i> of the 1966 Act to allow a prospective use of the machinery, rather than waiting until the outturn figures have arrived. What the amendment does is to say that that is only half the story, or ought to be. If we look at the 1966 Act—which we all almost see in our sleep these days—we see that it is not merely section 5(1 
	<i>)(b)</i> that is the trigger of the punitive sanctions, but also section 5(l)(a), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a local authority of a joint board have failed to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of their functions".</p></blockquote>
That is also a situation in which the original 1966 Act could be triggered at the discretion of the Secretary of State of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of this simple amendment—but a far-reaching one, and of some importance in principle—is that the new punitive powers, the rearrangement of the prospective timetable, should apply not only to section 
	<i>5(l)(b)</i> criteria, but to section 5(l)(a) criteria. In other words, if the Secretary of State is to equip himself with a large and fearsome club with which to terrorise local authorities that he thinks are spending excessively and unreasonably, we are saying to him that at the end of the day he ought to have the same sort of armoury with which to deal with a local authority that, in the words of the 1966 Act, is failing
	<br><blockquote><p>"to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of their functions".</p></blockquote>
If we need this kind of clout to deal with the one, we should have the same clout to deal with the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very simple, logical point, that if one has sanction machinery which is being revamped—if that is not too undignified a term for the processes of Parliament—one should do a comprehensive job. If sanctions were proper under the 1966 Act—and I do not think that anyone has advanced an argument that they were not properly included in the 1966 Act—the Minister's modification and " improvement" should also apply to the criteria in section 5(1)(a), the failure
	<br><blockquote><p> "to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard".</p></blockquote>
I am very surprised that that has not been done. We shall hear in a minute or two why it has not been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the inclusion of the criteria of section 5(1)(a)—the underspending criteria, if I may use that shorthand term from now on to save the Committee's time—was not opposed by the Conservative Party. I will not weary the Committee, but merely say that it was a very short debate in 1966.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not like this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on clause 5, which introduced the penal sanctions, ran to only about 20 columns of 
	<i>Hansard,</i> and that was the old-fashioned 
	<i>Hansard,</i> which will soon have an antique air, the short column 
	<i>Hansards.</i> Columns 163-182 encompassed the entire debate on these penal sanctions. The Opposition of the day clearly approved of the shape of the 1966 Act. Indeed, some of those 20 columns were used up by such important matters as the proposal that the words
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall be satisfied"</p></blockquote>
should be replaced by
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall be convinced". </p></blockquote>
It was hardly a matter of principle. I am ashamed to say, in view of my performance in the Committee the other day, that the gentleman who moved that amendment had been to look at the Oxford English Dictionary, and a very arid point resulted from that journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, there was no great opposition in principle. I have looked through the 
	<i>Official Report</i> carefully. The main Opposition speech on clause stand part was appropriately made by the now hon Member for Southend, East (Mr. Taylor), happily, translated to far places nowadays, but still green in our memory. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At our last meeting, he"—</p></blockquote>
the then Under-Secretary—
	<br><blockquote><p>"voiced general concern about over-spending, and he said that if an authority overspends he is going to take the firm action of asking them why."</p></blockquote>
The hon Member for Southend, East is more than the man that he was if he thought that firm action was asking why.
	<br><blockquote><p>"If he asks them and gets an unsatisfactory answer, what precisely will he do then? In subsection (1, 
	<i>b)</i> we have the answer: he is going to cut their grants. But that is no answer at all."—[
	<i>Official Report, Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 7 July 1966; c.175.]</p></blockquote>
I agree with the hon Member for Southend, East. That is a point that we may make later. 1 read that quotation because it was the kernel of the attack on the original section 5. As far as I can see—and 1 have conscientiously read my way through those 20 columns —no Conservative Member said "It is perfectly fair to have the 'excessive and unreasonable
	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --> criteria in subsection (1)(6), but there is no way that we will have the criteria in paragraph 
	<i>(a)."</i> In other words, my point—I am sure that the Minister takes it—is that the underspending criteria were included in the 1966 Act with broad cross-party support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us like sanctions, but if we need them they should apply to both the overspenders and the under-spenders. My simple proposition, which I hope will find favour on the Opposition side of the Committee, is that there should be the same evenhanded treatment for potential sinners. I use the word "sinners" recognising the criterion for it is subjective, in the eye of the Administration of the day. If we are to have this concept of fiscal sin, underspending should be included in the new rules and sanctions as certainly as overspending. 1 can see no moral or practical case for not including it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary will no doubt say—as, to be fair, his party was saying in 1966—that the Government are more worried about overspending than about underspending. But, as he accepts, if machinery is built into an Act which will depend upon subjective Executive discretion, that discretion will be operated in different ways at different times. Without going into the merits of the general Labour approach to local government spending, 1 believe that we should not exclude what is obviously the exercise of a legitimate political discretion within the normal parameters of political debate in Scotland. By selectively picking for the new penal powers only the overspending criterion,
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
we are deliberately excluding an important level of possible action which was included with widespread support in the 1966 Act. That is entirely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister to consider a situation, not difficult to envisage, in which a local authority was mean, parsimonious, feckless, complacent, inadequate and inert, and was not delivering adequate services to its electorate. 
	<i>[Interruption].</i> No, I am not particularly talking about any one authority. That might be a little unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me generalise a little to make the point. If one trawled through the activities of some of the Conservative regional councils which are particularly beloved of the Minister—or by some of his colleagues, because some of them make these points more frequently—one might very well find examples of what any reasonable person would see as reasonable standards not being maintained. The Minister, in the present financial climate, might take the view that he did not wish to move against those authorities. He would see that as good housekeeping, as a proper, respectable, tidy financial order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is perhaps all right at the moment, but can the Minister not stretch his imagination a little wider? I agree that it is a considerable imaginative effort, but let us assume that the Conservative Government have the economy right. Let us assume that at some mythical period in the future we shall not have Conservative Ministers prating on about the need to cut public expenditure to hold down the cost of local government. He might at that stage find that some of these authorities have the habit of being mean ingrained into them, he would be trying to encourage them to spend, while they were not responding as he wished. There would be people in the local authorities who were suffering considerably as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that hypothetical but I do not think ludicrous situation—it could happen, and I believe that it may well happen—would the Minister not regret that he had not taken the powers, or an extension of the powers which he is taking now, and applied them to what was originally in the 1966 Act, the underspend criteria? He must consider this seriously when he is evaluating the worth of this amendment, which would put that right and—this should appeal to him—would leave him with that rather wider and rather more equitable discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking the other day to an expert, a professional person in social work and community involvement. We were talking about the Tayside region and discussing why in Tayside there are almost no residents' associations. The reason given to me was ingenious and had never occurred to me—that in Dundee and other places under the aegis of the Tayside regional council there has been practically no expenditure at all upon community workers based in the community. I cannot argue, and would not want to argue, about whether that is a good or bad policy, but it is one that has had certain effects, one that is out of line certainly with what many people would see as reasonable standards in a region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A future Secretary of State might well want to say "There is a great deal of finance not being used here. Under-spending has become a problem, whether in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
social work or wherever, and we would like to put on some pressure, moral pressure. Our powers of persuasion have failed." Originally we could go to the 1966 Act, but we know that it is largely ineffective, and that is why we are having to amend it now in this miscellaneous provisions Bill. If he ever became Secretary of State, the Under-Secretary might say
	<br><blockquote><p>"How I wish that I had accepted the Opposition's advice and widened that, so that I could discipline a mean and pettifogging authority which is not giving the kind of service required".</p></blockquote>
I do not intend to list them, but we can all think of a number of requirements as regards social work facilities and the disabled, as two examples, where an authority might be failing patently to carry out its duties, and where this new power ought to be available. For example, if one looks at consumer protection or sewerage and river purification, and if one looks at the figures in the 1980 Rating Review for expenditure per thousand of the population, the kind of variations to which I have referred will be seen. Let us take the figures for day centres for the physically handicapped on the basis of expenditure per thousand of the population. Tayside spends £91; Strathclyde spends £221; and Central region spends £382. It is a large spread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that he would never want to interfere with the discretion of a local authority to order its own priorities, and he may ask "If Tayside wants to be mean in this way, if it does not want to provide for its physically handicapped, what business is it of the Secretary of State to try to force it to do it?" If that is his argument, I freely concede that there is no need for the amendment. But he would have to apply the logic and withdraw his own clause, because quite clearly he is taking the powers. He would be able to say, for example, if he thought Strathclyde and Central were over-spending, that he would use the new punitive powers. With Tayside spending well under a third per 1,000 of the population compared with Central region, what is wrong with saying "If we are to have this kind of interference, let us have the power to interfere to help electors, and not stop people who want to provide decent services"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then at least we are on common ground to that extent, Mr. Gourlay. The amendment is to insert additional words in page 6, line 25, after "unreasonable". In other words we seek to put after "excessive and unreasonable" another criterion to trigger this measure. That other criterion is:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p> "that a local authority on the basis of the said total estimated expenses will fail to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard in the discharge of any of their functions."</p></blockquote>
I conceded at the beginning that some consequential amendments would be needed, but the effect of that principal amendment would be to allow the Secretary of State, if he thought it justified and if he thought that a local authority was failing
	<br><blockquote><p>"to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard",</p></blockquote>
to move against it with the punitive powers described in clause 13, which are being added to section 5 of the 1966 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not test your patience, Mr. Gourlay, but I was merely trying to explain why I thought it perfectly reasonable and logical that these powers should be built in, that this additional criterion to strike at underspending authorities—"unreasonably" underspending authorities, if I may put it that way—should be allowed. I hope that I was not transgressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of that explanation, I now understand what the hon Gentleman has been driving at.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful, Mr. Gourlay. That is very helpful of you. 1 have a lot of sympathy. It is a pretty obscure provision that we are ploughing through, and it may well be that the form of words legally does not achieve my aim, but the intention is clear enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point. 1 was talking about the figures for day centres for the physically handicapped as an example, but the same point could be made about residential accommodation for the physically handicapped, where I am sorry to say that Tayside is again the laggard, with £181 per thousand of the population, whilst the Strathclyde figure is £303 and the figure for Dumfries and Galloway to its great credit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
—principal friends of the Under-Secretary—is £383. That is an enormous spread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By any reasonable standards—certainly by the reasonable standard of comparable authorities, which is one of the criteria that the Under-Secretary will build into his new provision—I would have thought it self-evident that there was a case. If there is a case for this kind of interference at all at either end of the spectrum, there is surely a case for including the underspender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised that I would not speak at length about examples, because sometimes they do not help us. I hope that I have given enough to indicate what I meant. There will always be difficulties about the relationship between central and local government. The Minister may argue that there is a considerable difference between underspending and overspending. He may be too intelligent to do so, but as an insurance let me deal with an argument that I might anticipate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman may well argue that overspending by an authority is more serious, and that for it one needs the prospective rather than the retrospective sanction. If it is retrospective the money has been spent, and there is nothing that can be done about it, while for underspending he will say " There is no such hurry. The old retrospective sanction under the 1966 Act will be sufficient: at the end of the day there is no question of the money being spent, and we can put it right by forcing the authority to spend more in the following year."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may well consider just how topsy-turvy the whole matter is. If one tries to help the ratepayer by imposing a sanction on overspending authorities, the result will be to do it by taking even more money away from it, and the service will then deteriorate. To be fair and to balance that argument, it is also a little illogical to say that because an authority is underspending one will take even more away from it—money that it presumably does not need, because it is not spending up to the guidelines or what is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an essential illogicality built into this whole exercise. The Minister might argue that the important thing was that, in the case of overspending, the money was gone beyond recall, and that in the second case it could be put right by more spending in the subsequent year. That is a bad argument, Mr. Gourlay. I must not assume that the Chairman, who is impartial, will agree with my arguments, but I am sure that the Committee will agree, because underspending can in a way be much more damaging to the individual resident in a local authority area. If there is a need for day care for the elderly, care for the physically or mentally handicapped, or any other essential service—the home help service, educational provision and so on—the fact that an authority is underspending and not providing it may mean a genuine and permanent loss for those affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Morally, that is a much more serious case than saying that if the provision is not prospective as distinct from retrospective, the money will be gone, spent in a profligate manner. There is a stronger case for making the change for the criterion in section 5(l)(a) than there is in section 
	<i>5(l)(b).</i> Certainly, to specify the second and not the first is to have your priorities in a very bad muddle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that Ministers are entitled to be worried
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
about overspending. But I understand that underspending, which I should now like to include in the new criteria in the amendment, has been more of a worry to local authorities than overspending. I do not want to weary hon Members with facts and figures. There is a general acceptance on both sides of the Committee that local authorities over the years have tended to underspend, not overspend. The Minister will be familiar with the point put very firmly in the submissions from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I say in passing that COSLA is completely opposed to this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And to the hon Member's proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Possibly, but it is still worth exploring. The point that COSLA is making is that underspending has been a feature of local authority finance, and financial control has been a feature over the years. It drew attention to an article in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> on 4 December 1980, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The maladministration of local authority affairs which has been something of a feature of recent government performance continues to lurch from bad to worse."</p></blockquote>
I think, to be fair, that it is talking about England, but I would apply that phrase more generally. The article continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Minsters may still argue that this travesty of economic administration is justified by the need to 'bring the local authorities to heel' but the evidence does not support them. With one or two well publicised exceptions"</p></blockquote>
—and we can all think of those in Scotland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local authorities have a record of sound budgetary control which Whitehall should envy whether or not their policies reflect those of the central government."</p></blockquote>
I think that that is true. The attempt to cabin and confine local authorities in the way that the Bill envisages will, in my view, lead to more local authority expenditure rather than less. I think that the record over the years will prove that point. Any savings that may be incurred by the flourishing of the big club to which I referred will in my view be well outweighed by the extra expenditure that may result from it. It is a topsy-turvy world. The Minister should perhaps consider whether the appearance of doing something is always useful, against the reality of what is likely to happen. I urge him to consider whether he should not put in the underspending criterion that I have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise—and I say this in no sarcastic spirit— that consistency is not always a political virtue. We are on occasions driven to expediency, and expediency is a fact of political life which I would firmly defend, I have often resorted to it; I will not say "have been guilty of it". I have sensibly adopted measures of expediency on many occasions, and no doubt I shall do so on many occasions in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
What I am saying is that here we have a generally accepted remit for penal sanctions, in subsections (1) 
	<i>(a)</i> and 
	<i>(l)(b)</i> of section 5 of the 1966 Act. We are now "improving"—I stress the inverted commas—the sanctions, but, lo and behold, the underspending sanctions disappears, and the overspending authority alone is to be in the stocks, to be whipped by the irate Secretary of State. It seems to me that that is illogical
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live in the real world—or I hope I do—and I agree that there is a problem for a Conservative Minister. Underspending authorities tend to be mean authorities, authorities which think that there is something wrong with decent public services, and which are not prepared to fund them because their natural political supporters are perhaps few, except perhaps in terms of higher education and so on. There is built into such authorities tradition of underspending, a tendency to underspend. They are the political friends, or the political colleagues, of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon Gentleman accepted this amendment to bring in underspending, as well as overspending, as a criterion, he might be rather unpopular with some Conservative local authorities, although by no means all. I mentioned at least one honourable example of a spending record in a Conservative region a few minutes ago. However, I suppose that not even the Conservative authorities will relish the idea of the Secretary of State's beady eye upon them, and the thought that at any time they may be told that they are not performing as they should. They will have read all the splendid speeches about local authority discretion, those throwaway lines which I gather carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day we had a minor order on the Floor of the House about the withdrawal of certain grants. In the course of his technically adequate explanation of the effect of that order, the Minister had a nice little throwaway line about his belief in allowing the widest possible measure of discretion to local authorities. That is not compatible with what he is doing here, but he may pray it in aid as an example of why we should not extend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, that I believe that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If we are to go for overspending, we should at least leave the option for a Secretary of State who might have different priorities, different ideas about what is right and proper, to ensure that to his mind a local authority was providing adequate services for the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own view is that if there is a case for central Government interfering with the discretion of local government it is to ensure that there is something like a reasonable uniformity of its basic services. Local government must of course have a wide discretion about its own priorities within that acceptable parameter. But I suppose it is arguable that central Government can set the limits—wide limits, generous limits—within which local authorities can rate to increase or improve particular services or can have their own particular emphasis, their own particular stress on what they think is valuable or what is particularly necessary in response to their own industrial, social, demographic, geographical and other problems. The only defence for this kind of interference is that it is broadly based. It should not be pettifogging. I know that the Minister will agree with that, because he said that he did not
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
want to look at specific items of expenditure but wanted to obtain a global picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, a Conservative Secretary of State—and perhaps a Labour Secretary of State, because, after all, we introduced the original 1966 Act— may want to say "This authority has overspent to such a point that it must be brought up, because it is affecting the PSBR. It is wrecking the Government's whole public sector strategy." But as soon as one assumes that, as soon as one accepts that that is so, then there is presumably a mirror image below the spending line. There must be a situation in which a local authority, for reasons of misjudgment, or prejudice, or merely of parsimony and meanness, may be spending so little that it is jeopardising its statutory duty, jeopardising the reasonable level of civilised services which every local authority ought to provide. There should be the same powers in that situation as in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that he cannot envisage using such powers, but he said—I accept his 
	<i>bona fides</i> here—that he would use his powers on overspending only as a last resort and in extremis, if he thought that an authority had gone totally over the top. There might similarly be a situation in which a local authority had not even reached the bottom of what is an acceptable level of service. I cannot for the life of me see any real argument why that broad sector which is outlined in section 5 of the 1966 Act should not be universally and comprehensively caught by the new machinery which is being brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may well reassure me by saying that he intends to drop the new machinery of section 
	<i>5(l)(b).</i> In that case, I shall be glad to drop the amendment. But I know that he will not say that; it is too much to hope. Given that situation, and given that he will pig-headedly press ahead—I think that he will regret it—there is a strong case in equity, logic and common sense for maintaining continuity, maintaining the criteria under the 1966 Act, and passing the amendment. My hon Friends may have some thoughts on this. I hope that the Minister also will have some thoughts about it and that they will be constructive and helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment so ably moved by my hon Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), who has presented an important case which merits close attention by the Committee and by the Minister. As it stands the clause is unbalanced. It puts wide-ranging powers into the hands of the Secretary of State in order to penalise local authorities whose expenditure is, in his opinion, "unreasonable and excessive". He is presumably talking about Lothian regional council, in which both the Minister and I have a close interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I feel that it is not for any Secretary of State for Scotland or for any Committee of the House to define whether any particular regional or district council is "unreasonable or excessive" in it spending. It is up to the local authority electors to decide that. I have yet to meet anybody in East Lothian, which is part of my constituency, who is prepared to say where he wants cuts in spending to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

can he explain why last year, until he was rebuked by his constituency party, he was reported in the press on several occasions as having rebuked the Labour group on Lothian regional council for refusing even to try to reduce its expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, as ever, has his facts completely wrong. I was never rebuked by my constituency party. The matter to which the Minister has drawn attention was a question which I put to the convener of the Lothian regional council, when I merely inquired whether it was reasonable or advisable to go for growth under the circumstances. I am sure that I am out of order, and I shall be happy to pursue this question elsewhere. I simply reiterate what I was saying before the Minister intervened—that I have yet to find anyone in East Lothian who is prepared to identify services provided by the regional council which he or she would be prepared to forgo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is unbalanced about the clause as it stands is that it provides no powers to ensure that underspending authorities bring their services up to the mark. It does nothing to ensure that local authorities do their work properly. There certainly are such belt-and-braces local authorities, if I may so describe them. I used to serve on one, Berwickshire district council, which was an amazing little district council. It managed to keep its rate at 10p in the pound ever since it was set up and to keep its expenditure at such a level that it actually accrued surpluses. It got all that money out of the 10p rate and the rate support grant, and it has not been able to spend that money. It was actually criticised by the official auditor for hoarding public money, because it was not prepared to spend the money on providing services for the people in the district. To my mind, that kind of local authority is every bit as irresponsible as the kind of authority that the Minister thinks he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman recall that the local people in that area were so grateful for the way in which their Conservative authority was running matters that all the Conservative candidates were declared returned before the election, because there was nobody standing against them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Minister has his facts absolutely wrong. I am happy to announce that one of the wards, for the first time ever in Berwickshire district, at the election last May returned a Labour candidate. I am sure that this will be the beginning of great things in the Border, and that we shall see the pseudo-independents, Right-wing backwoodsmen, Tories and suchlike swept out of existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, Mr. Gourlay, I am way out of order. The Minister is trying to goad me into a filibuster. As my hon Friend the Member for South Ayshire (Mr. Foulkes) says, that is disgraceful, because we have received an indication that the Minister is already talking about a sittings motion, which is most unreasonable. We are spending a lot of time talking about the adjective "unreasonable", and I think that it would be extremely unreasonable for the Minister to take
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
such an initiative at this stage of our considerations of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am referring to underspending local authorities, local authorities which do not provide sufficient services. In this International Year of Disabled People it is probably worth referring to the fact that there are certainly—I shall not mention any names—local authorities in Scotland that are not fulfilling their statutory obligations under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. I am talking about the survey of disabled people in those areas and the activities that they are supposed to set in motion to provide proper facilities and services for disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dare say that there are statutory means by which a local authority which is not coming up to the level of services and activities which it is supposed to provide under the terms of the Act can be brought to heel, but I imagine that the procedures are bound to be rather complicated, costly and crude. In the clause that is now before us, the Minister has come forward with an excellent mechanism whereby local authorities that are not doing their job properly can be brought to heel. The clause could provide an effective way of ensuring that such local authorities do their job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the clause provides an effective, and indeed brutal, method whereby the Secretary of State can put the boot into local authorities such as Lothian region, regardless of the fact that this would hurt the very ratepayers whom the Secretary of State claims to be seeking to protect. If the amendment were accepted, it would be possible for the Secretary of State to use precisely the same mechanism to ensure that local authorities provided the services which they are statutorily required to provide under measures such as the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the Bill does absolutely nothing to ensure that underspenders, local authorities which do not provide proper services, can be brought into line. Under the circumstances, I sincerely hope that the Committee will accept the amendment so ably moved by my hon Friend the Member for Garscadden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to underline what my hon Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has been saying. Up to now the debate has been on the wickedness of authorities that overspend in the Minister's judgment, but local authorities are equally wicked and irresponsible in failing to provide services which are obviously essential. I give just one example that came to my knowledge in the course of the last local government elections. I was invited along to Kinross to speak on behalf of the Labour candidate. As far as I know we had never had a Labour member on that district council—a typical Tory-controlled authority, feudal in the extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just before the meeting began, the candidate handed me an advertisement from the local paper saying that the Tory-controlled council would not in future provide the services of a ratcatcher. That is not the verbiage used, I think it was a vermin controller or a rodent controller, but that is what it meant. It said that in future any tenant who had rats or any other kind of vermin would have to go to the private purveyors of service to deal with them. That was a typical example of the Tory approach to such a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
That kind of service is essential in the interests of the health of others besides those directly affected by the rats or other vermin. It has much wider health implications. For a local authority to discard that function implies that if one cannot afford the services of a person who provides it privately, one does without it. But the rats are still there and they multiply. The situation becomes infinitely worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of criminal irresponsibility by that local authority. Why should not that be taken account of in the legislation that we pass? I shall expand on that and other cases on the Floor of the Hou se on Tuesday if I catch Mr. Speaker's eye, because we shall be referring to the way in which authorities, primarily Tory-controlled, are, with the connivance and encouragement of the Government—indeed, in some cases at the direction of the Government—destroying or running down those services which are so essential to the wellbeing not only of individual citizens but of the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example where the Scottish Office itself is responsible. I put down a question the other day and got the answer that the action of the Government was deliberately preventing the building of sheltered housing in new towns. There is an example in Glenrothes where new sheltered housing for disabled people is being stopped at the direction of the Government. They are being told that there is to be no more progress in this field. The figures are on the record, and I shall produce them in the House on Tuesday if I get the chance. This is a case of irresponsibility, wickedness and inhumanity by the Government. If we do no other than draw attention to these things in the course of the debate, it will have served a useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend referred to examples in connection with the disabled. We all receive representations from the Disablement Income Group, a highly respectable, responsible, non-party organisation. It has given us instances of how local authorities, at the behest of the Government, if not their direction, are deliberately refusing to implement certain provisions of the 1970 Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act. Other authorities—mainly Tory authorities—are, eventually if not immediately, getting rid of services such as the school meals service. They are getting rid of, or making difficult, the provision of home helps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these things are the direct responsibility of the Government's policy on local authority provisions. Local authorities should be allowed to judge the need for the school meals service and services under the 1970 Act, and the need for ratcatchers to be on the rates. That is not an unreasonable proposition. Why should the local authority be allowed to say that it is getting out of that? If the tenant cannot afford to get the ratcatcher in as a private enterpriser, a thrusting private entrepreneur, which is what the Prime Minister is arguing, what will happen? Do we have the thrusting entrepreneur chasing rats and the local authority saying " We are getting out of this; the Prime Minister says so"? That is ruddy nonsense, is it not? But this is not funny, because it erodes the quality of life of people who for one reason or another cannot afford to pay out of their own pocket—nor should they be expected to— for a service which is so fundamental to the health of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
The same applies in different degree to other services that I have mentioned—school meals, the provision of sheltered housing. Do the Government really believe that our national finances are in such a parlous state that we have to say to disabled people in Glenrothes and elsewhere " You shall not have a house in the foreseeable future. You shall not get a house built to your requirements, because our elegant Prime Minister says you cannot have it. We have all got to suffer"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Energy said some while ago that there should be fair shares of austerity, or whatever it is, all round. It is not fair shares all round. The people who are taking the brunt of the provisions in this clause are the very people whom we ought to be protecting in a civilised society. But the Government are not civilised. They do not pretend to be fair; they do not pretend to practise equity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debate clause stand part, if the Government want evidence of waste by Tory authorities, not by Kinross, to which I have referred, but in other respects, I will give some evidence of gross waste by Tory authorities that has not received the same kind of publicity as Tory Members have given to the Lothian region. It is time some stories were told on the other side. If I get the chance in the debate on clause stand part I will give one or two examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm the observation of the hon Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that it is my intention, as we have discussed informally with the Opposition, to give notice today of a Sitting Motion to enable afternoon sittings from next Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by commenting on the remarks of the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), in particular his comments about what he chose to describe as the wickedness of the low-spending authorities, and his implication, if not his explicit statement, that somehow these are Tory authorities which are by nature mean and inconsiderate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If, therefore, the Opposition to argue that low-spending authorities are by their nature wicked, uncaring, mean and inconsiderate, the hon Gentleman might like to indicate whether he included Fife regional council in that categorisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman had better spell out exactly where he thinks the services in Fife are any worse than those of other authorities. But he is making my point. Without direction from the Government, Fife is exercising its democratic right to use the money as it wants without the provisions in the Bill. That proves the point that if such authorities are left alone, if they are democratically elected and are left alone to get on with the job, they do the job within the means available to them without the further powers that the Minister seeks in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The fact that Fife regional council is, according to the hon Gentleman, providing all the vital services that the community requires—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The fact that despite being low-spending Fife can provide the vital services, is a very good recommendation to all the other Labour-controlled local authorities, such as Lothian, that could act in a similar way. If the hon Gentleman thinks that Fife is exceptional, he may be interested to know that while the second lowest spender per capita is Tayside, the third lowest is another Labour-controlled authority, Central region. If we are being told to accept that low-spending authorities are by their nature wickedly mean and inconsiderate of the needs of their local community, it is interesting that amongst the regional councils two of the three lowest spenders are Labour-controlled authorities. That is an interesting point which the hon Gentleman did not comment on in his otherwise very interesting remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that there are similarities between Fife and Central region? They are two compact authorities which do not have large tracts of rural areas with large numbers of roads to look after. They do not have some of the problems of large rural areas, and there are a number of other specific factors which have to be taken into account. Would he also not concede that the most appropriate people to take those factors into account are the local authorities themselves? That is why my hon Friend is right in saying that these decisions should be left to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: am glad that it has now been stated by common agreement of all Opposition hon Members that the fact that an authority is low-spending does not by itself in any way—nor should it—lead to the conclusion that it is not providing the vital services which its community requires, or that it is wickedly irresponsible, as hon Gentlemen appeared to have been suggesting earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the argument that was being put to us, that somehow low-spending authorities were by definition wickedly irresponsible, but that when they were Labour-controlled local authorities one need not come to that conclusion. Only if the political party in control is the Conservative Party is it necessary— in the Opposition's eyes—to equate low spending with wicked irresponsibility. No doubt the ratcatchers of Fife are safe, because they are not incompatible with the level of spending of the authority in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I turn now to the amendment. I was fascinated by the comments of the hon Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) when he said that this was not a probing amendment, but one which the Opposition absolutely believed in as being highly desirable. If that is the case, it is very helpful to the Committee, because it means we are no longer talking about principles. It is no longer being said—as the Opposition have been saying up to now—that the principles—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman will contain himself, I can continue. We have been told up to now that it is somehow utterly wrong in principle for the Government to consider, on the basis of estimated expenditure alone, penalising a local authority. No doubt the Opposition will say that they still maintain that. If they do, and if what we are talking about is not simply tidiness or neatness, but principle, there is no way, irrespective of the rest of this clause, in which the Opposition should be arguing in favour of this amendment. If there is something which is objectionable in principle, the objection does not disappear because one is doing it for low-spending as well as high-spending authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There, at least, we are in total agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not for the moment dealing with the merits of the hon Gentleman's amendment, in that he has departed from an objection of principle, for the purposes of clause 13. If he says that his particular proposal is somehow acceptable in principle, we are simply talking about neatness and expediency, and no longer about principle. I do not necessarily dissent from that, but it should be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, if the Secretary of State is able to use penal powers of withdrawal of RSG on the basis of estimated expenditure, that should apply to likely underspending
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
rather than overspending. I make two broad points to the hon Gentleman in response to his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, whatever may be the views of hon Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee about the individual items of expenditure of individual authorities, no one has seriously sought to argue that the totality of local authority spending has been declining in recent years, or that the totality—and it is the totality of the expenditure with which the hon Member's amendment and the clause itself are concerned—is not a matter of great public concern. Hon Gentlemen will be aware that local authorities are spending more than they have ever spent before in aggregate. Indeed, the amount provided for in terms of relevant expenditure for next year's rate support grant is more in real terms than in 1977-78. So it is not a matter of rational comment from any quarter to suggest that the totality of expenditure by local authorities has been going down or ought to be dramatically falling in the way that the amendment implies. Therefore, that is not an appropriate consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the detailed provisions of clause 13, the question is to what extent it is necessary to depart from the provisions in the Labour Government's Act of 1966. We do not depart from them just for the sake of it. We add to them to the extent that is necessary at the present time, and at the present time, and for the foreseeable future, what we are talking about is the problem of overspending by individual authorities and whether that should be dealt with by selective action against those authorities or by indiscriminate action against local authorities as a whole. I have not the slightest doubt that hon Gentlemen would privately, and I suspect even publicly, concede that, if one is to take penal action against anyone, it is right that it should be taken against individual authorities that are responsible for the problem and not broadly against all local authorities, irrespective of whether they have been underspending or overspending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one only acts to deal with overspending authorities only when the money has already been spent, it is closing the door after the horse has bolted. I am sorry to use the phrase, but I used it on Second Reading, and there is no particular reason why I should not use it on this occasion. That is the fundamental reason why an amendment is necessary. Otherwise we could quite happily rest on the 1966 Act which the Labour Government passed. Once the expenditure had already been incurred, once it was too late to have any effect on the expenditure, that Act was concerned simply with clawing back rate support grant from the next year's allocation of RSG—in a year which had nothing to do with the overspending that had taken place. That is not a sound basis, because it is seeking to deal with the problem once the damage has already been caused, if one accepts that it is damage that we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the Bill, or in any other provisions that the Government have brought forward, to repeal the underspending provisions of the 1966 Act. We are in no way denying that there may be circumstances in which it will be possible to see,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
once a year has been concluded and expenditure has been incurred, that there has been gross underspending by a particular authority that would justify these powers being used. But the hon Gentleman put forward no convincing case why, when we are dealing with underspending, it is necessary to act in anticipation rather than retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I repeat the hon Gentleman's words fairly. What he said was that it was not correct to say that there were no problems caused by acting retrospectively, because, if a local authority is failing to provide adequate services, people will lose out during the course of that year. He is quite right. But they will lose out just as much if the rate support grant is withdrawn immediately after the budget has been established. They will in no way be assisted in that respect, nor will there be any public interest served. A local authority faced with having lost an element of its rate support grant, is no longer able to pass on any increased burden to the ratepayer, because the rates have already been decided. If it is acting at all sensibly and rationally, it will then modify its expenditures as a consequence. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between the two approaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there was any convincing reason—and none has been forthcoming up till now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Wait for it</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We always await with eager anticipation the hon Member for South Ayrshire. No doubt he will have some stimulating, if not entirely appropriate, comments to make on various parts of the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, Mr. Gourlay, the Minister is not questioning the way in which you are conducting our proceedings. It would be most unfortunate if he were to suggest, as he seems to be doing, that you did not pull people up if they deviated from the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a slight difference between what is in order and what is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Gourlay. That is why I chose the word "appropriate". In no way do I wish to withdraw the suggestion that the hon Gentleman's contributions are always stimulating, irrespective of their appropriateness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are concerned with is not a brand-new-area of law. We are seeking to amend an existing provision, and it is only appropriate that we should amend it to the extent that it needs amending. There is no evidence of gross underspending by authorities as a whole. The totality of local authorities' expenditure, indeed of individual local authorities' expenditure, including the underspending authorities so dear to the heart of the hon Member for Fife Central, has been increasing over the years. Fife regional council is spending more in the current year than it spent in previous years, although it remains one of the lowest-spending authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is no real problem of aggregate under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
spending. If there is a problem of overspending, as the Government believe there is, that is the area to which attention must be paid. It would be quite wrong for us to be amending legislation with the objectives of neatness or tidiness. We should amend legislation only if there is a clear need. The Government believe it inappropriate here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let me continue, because I see you rising gently, Mr. Gourlay. I was about to say that what was happening outwith the meeting place was directly relevant to what we are discussing. Every morning I had the great pleasure of seeing French street-cleaners, not ratcatchers, assiduously cleaning the streets of Strasbourg. Are we seriously being told by the Minister that local authorities in this country, which has its own great supply of wealth from North Sea oil, are unable to provide the kind of efficient daily service that I saw across the Channel? Local authorities are seriously having to consider and reconsider their services, such as street cleaning, because of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting point—this comes back to what my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said earlier—is that the Government's action is being taken for doctrinaire political reasons. France has developed public services not because it
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
has a Socialist Government, a Left-wing Government, or a Labour Government, but because it believes it to be right. It has had that kind of philosophy of developing public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of public services can and should be considered outwith, or partly outwith, the political dogfight. It can be continued and improved without the necessity of a particularly Socialist doctrine. It is encouraging to see it across the water, and it is a great pity that the Government cannot see that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman accept that France, like other such countries, has paid for its public expenditure out of growth and has not incurred the massive deficits which have been one of the main causes of inflation in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be ruled out of order for straying into wider realms. But it is also true that France is subjected to economic problems similar to ours. It is about to have car plants closed my multinational companies based in the United Kingdom. It is interesting to see, however, that it is still maintaining its public services.

Those are preliminary remarks that I wanted to make before dealing with what the Minister said. I thought that I might be called before the Minister, but I am glad that I am following him, because I should like to deal with some of the outrageous things that he said. This whole argument—every word that he said—was based on a false premise. The figures for Fife that he read to us related solely to spending per head of population. He knows well that that is not the only criterion, nor the best criterion, nor the criterion which the Government themselves used in calculating rate support grant. There are a number of indices and criteria which are important in judging the spending performance of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon Friend agree that the amendment makes the criterion not low spending but failure to maintain reasonable standards? That is what we are asking for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon Friend has said that, because it doubly underscores what I was saying. The Minister was working on not only a false premise but a misreading of the amendment. We are talking about the level of services, not about underspending, and certainly not about underspending per head of population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member must appreciate that when I made these remarks I was simply replying to the observations of his hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), who referred to the wickedness of low-spending authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now it is the Minister who is retreating on his earlier remarks. Now it is he who is on the run. He knows that he takes account in his calculations of the numbers of elderly people in the population, and he knows that there are more in some regions than in others. He knows that Fife
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
does not have a particularly large elderly population, whereas some regions do. He knows that the area of a region is taken into account, and that the provision of services is more expensive over a large area than over a compact area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He knows that the length of road to be maintained is an important criterion. He knows that the number of children under 5 and the number in school are important criteria. But he totally ignores them, trying to make a clever, cheap political point against my hon Friend, who made a good, intelligent and logical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would not believe it to listen to him, but the Minister has had some experience of local government. He and I served together on the old Edinburgh corporation. He knows the problems of understanding and the way in which local authorities are facing these difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up the very important point—I think the main point—of this debate, made by my hon Friends. I made it on Second Reading, and nothing that has happened since has detracted from what I said then. In fact, everything that I have seen supports what I said then. It is my view, and it is increasingly the view of people outside this room, that some of the local authorities that are being forced to cut back that are underspending, whose spending performance is poor, are in breach of their statutory responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the next few weeks or months there will be people—I am aware of this—taking action against such authorities. I hope that they will be taking legal action, and bringing Tayside region, Grampian region and other regions that are evading their responsibilities to court for not carrying out the responsibilities put upon them by Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one example. Under section 14 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, it is the responsibility of local authorities to provide home help services for a range of people, including the elderly and disabled. Talking recently to people involved, I have learnt that there have been reductions in the hours that home helps are available; days have been taken off the provision of home helps; home helps have actually been withdrawn. In many cases the condition of the old person concerned has not improved, but has deteriorated, yet he or she has had the home help services withdrawn. I make no idle prediction that over the next few months, as we go through the cold winter, old people will suffer and some may even die as a result of the Government's action and as a result of local authorities withdrawing home help services, their statutory responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same problem arises with the disabled. You have been involved for years in local authorities, Mr. Gourlay, and you know the position as well as I do. Many hon Members, including members of the Committee, know through their local government services that, far from our being able to reduce the number of home helps, we should increase their number. The number of old people over the age of 75 is increasing, and the number of those over 85 is doubling in two decades. Therefore, we should have at least twice the number of home helps just to maintain the existing service, yet it is being cut back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
That is just one example by which I hope we have proved beyond any doubt that some councils are in breach of their statutory responsibility. It proves the wisdom of the amendment. There are other examples. We are now getting to the stage where regional councils in the coming financial year, beginning on 1 April, will not be able to fulfil their statutory responsibility under section 15 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act for providing for children in care. So, what do they do? What will the directors of social work be able to do? The Government are putting them in an extremely difficult position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 10 of the same Act, local authorities have a responsibility for providing payments to people in need. This has often been the means by which we have ensured that people do not have their electricity disconnected, that evictions do not take place and that many couples with large families are not in difficulties. The local authorities will not have the resources to deal with section 10 payments. They will not have the resources to carry out their statutory responsibilities under this section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken three examples from one Act. There are other examples in it, and there is other social work legislation. The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act has been mentioned. There is also education legislation, and there is legislation for all other areas of local government responsibilities, where increasingly, I would contend, authorities will be in default. I am sure that that will provide fruitful opportunities for the former colleagues of the hon Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) to argue these matters before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Under-Secretary knows, for some time I have had the pleasure of having some degree of responsibility for education in the area that he represents. We had the great thrill of opening one of the first community schools in his constituency, and it was lauded. Indeed, I think that the Under-Secretary actually brought himself round to saying something complimentary about Lothian regional council when that school was opened. He even visited it. The school was and is a great advance. But the whole future development of community schools is in jeopardy because of what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community schools are a superb concept for providing facilities for the whole community, for making the school seem more than a place where young people go between the ages of 5 and 16 for formal education. They are providing opportunities for the whole community in the area. Such schools need extra resources, and yet the whole future, not just of new community schools but of existing community schools in Lothian region and elsewhere, is put in jeopardy by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The irony is that a school like Westerhailes can continue to provide services for the community which the hon Member purports to represent only because the Lothian regional council is saying to the Government "We are not having any of what you are directing us to do." The Minister is very lucky, because he is getting it both ways. He can do his mistress's bidding as a Minister—in a purely political sense, I hasten to add—but can sit back and enjoy with his constituents the services that Lothian
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
region is continuing to provide. Indeed, his own children could have the opportunity if he did not choose otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of school books. Conservative hon Members keep saying that we should not be talking about the frills in education, that we should not be worried about meals and milk, but that we should be concentrating on spending on teachers and books. But they will have received, as I did, the letter from John Davies, secretary of the Educational Publishers Association, with statistics showing that the expenditure on school books under the present Government is slumping rapidly. These are the kinds of things that the Government say ought to be provided, the things that improve the three Rs. They are not frills in education, but they are being cut back. Under the present Government we shall be back to the old slate and chalk era. That is what the Government would like to see—the old era of Wackford Squeers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that manpower in the teaching services is also vital. Yet how can local authorities, given the kind of pressure that they are getting from the Government, maintain the service by employing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
number of teachers that are necessary? I think that it was said in the debate in the Chamber on the rate support grant that at least 3,600 teachers might be made redundant if—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
