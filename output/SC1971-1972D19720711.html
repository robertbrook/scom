	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are to consider at the same time the following new Clauses:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 5—"
	<i>Finding of fact to be conclusive</i>"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions contained in section 75(1) of the National Insurance Act 1965, and the corresponding provision in section 50(1) of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965, that the decision of a claim or question as there mentioned is to be final shall make any finding of fact or other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision, or on which it is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further decision".</p></blockquote>
New Clause 6—"
	<i>Decision on origin of injury or disability</i>"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A decision (given under section 48(2) of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 or otherwise) that an accident was an industrial accident is to be taken as determining the origin of any injury or disability suffered by the claimant".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When you adjourned the Committee last Thursday, Sir Stephen, I was starting to answer the Under-Secretary of State's reply to the points raised on both sides of the Committee. An interesting feature of our debate was the fact that there was concern on both sides to know whether the implications of the Clause had been properly studied by anybody, including the Minister. As the hon. Gentleman continued his reply we all felt that he was rather unhappy about his brief. I do not blame him: the question is complex, and it is not until the technical points are subjected to the limelight of political argument that the full implications begin to emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to protract the debate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
nor do I intend to speak for as long as I had to when outlining our opposition to the Clause and introducing new Clauses 5 and 6. However, I must spend a little time answering the points made by the hon. Gentleman in standing by the meaning of the Clause. When we adjourned last Thursday I was dealing with one of the hon. Gentleman's main points—his argument that in this Clause the Government are merely restoring the position to what it was originally believed to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 48 of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1965 deals with the right of a person suffering personal injury by accident—should he claim the accident to have been an industrial accident—to have that question determined and a declaration made accordinely. The meaning is surely so clear that I should have thought that there could be no dispute about it. Let us consider the phraseology:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person suffering personal injury by accident shall be entitled, if he claims the accident was an industrial accident, to have that question determined and a declaration made…accordingly".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, that is one of the more lucid passages of the 1965 Act. So lucid is it that the point was never questioned, or even discussed, in the Standing Committees' consideration of the 1946 and 1965 Acts. If the hon. Gentleman is honest he will admit that he did not even attempt to deal with this point in his reply. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I now turn to the point concerning declarations, which has been mentioned by all hon. Members who have spoken. The effect of Clause 5 will be that a person may obtain a declaration that an accident was an industrial accident, provided that he shows first, that the accident arose out of or in the course of his employment; secondly, that his employment was insurable employment; and, thirdly, that the accident occurred in Great Britain."</p></blockquote>
There is no dispute about those provisoes. The hon. Gentleman went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is the position which obtained in the 1946 Act and in Section 48 of the subsequent consolidation Act."</p></blockquote>
There followed the classic 
	<i>non sequitur:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Therefore, it is not correct to adopt the interpretation that has been placed on these declarations, or indeed on finality of decisions."</p></blockquote>
When I asked the hon. Gentleman why not, he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the right hon. Lady will allow me to complete my argument."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 6th July, 1972; 
	<i>cc.</i> 390–1.]</p></blockquote>
When I asked if he would be returning
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
to the point he said that after he had completed the next leg of his argument he would be glad to deal with any issue which had arisen. He did not return to that basic point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a crucial factor under Clause 5. The hon. Gentleman owes the Committee a better explanation. I hope that he has had time for reconsideration since he spoke. In one of the cases that I quoted, Mr. Dowling established the hon. Gentleman's three points before the Commission and Mr. Nelson, who awarded him an accident declaration and industrial injury benefit. When Mr. Dowling claimed disablement benefit the medical appeal tribunal decided that he had not had an industrial accident. It was then that the Ministry introduced its strange doctrine that an accident declaration did not mean that the claimant had had an accident, but merely that if he had an accident it would be an industrial accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where and in what form does the hon. Gentleman claim that this strange rigmarole was embodied in the intentions of Parliament? How can he claim that that is the meaning of Section 48? I remind the Committee that the purpose of the Clause is to embody this new, strange rigmarole in our law for the third time. I ask the Committee to compare the two facts—that in the 1965 Act and that which we are asked to adopt this morning. Section 48(2) of the 1965 Act states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person suffering personal injury by accident shall be entitled, if he claims the accident was an industrial accident, to have that question determined, and a declaration made —"</p></blockquote>
Section 48(4) continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any declaration under this section that an accident was or was not an industrial accident shall be conclusive for the purposes of any claim for benefit in respect of that accident, —"</p></blockquote>
It does not say that it shall be valid for an industrial injury benefit claim but invalid for disablement benefit. If an industrial injury benefit is granted it is because an accident declaration has been obtained. That remains final. It is conclusive for the purposes of any claim for benefit in respect of that accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman claims the right to say, "Mr. Dowling got his accident declaration from the Commissioner on the final point of appeal for the determination of claim. I do not accept that that should be conclusive for the purposes of any
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
other benefit claim, namely, disablement benefit". How can the hon. Gentleman say that that was the intention of Section 48?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)—which is drawn up in somewhat involved language, as these things tend to be—makes it clear that the purpose is to stand Section 48 of the 1965 Act on its head. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A decision (given under section 48(2) of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 or otherwise) that an accident was an industrial accident is to be taken as determining only that paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>) of section 48(5) are satisfied in relation to the accident"</p></blockquote>
Those are the three provisoes that the hon. Gentleman quoted, and which are not in dispute. It says that a declaration of an accident as an industrial accident is to be taken as determining only those three points. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and neither any such decision nor the reference to a medical board or medical appeal tribunal under section 37 of that Act of the disablement questions in connection with any claim to or reward of disablement benefit is to be taken as importing a decision as to the origin of any injury or disability suffered by the claimant".</p></blockquote>
It is not surprising that the hon. Gentleman hopes that this Clause may slip by us, because to the layman, at first glance, it is difficult to understand. In simple language, it means that an accident declaration is no longer to be taken as determining that an accident had taken place. If an accident did not take place in Mr. Dowling's case, why did the Commissioner award him industrial injury benefit? One does not award industrial injury benefit out of the blue because one is sorry for a chap; it is given to him, by definition, because an accident has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it is nonsense to say that we are only re-establishing what was intended originally by Section 48. How can anyone who is honest and clear-headed say that the intentions of those two texts are not diametrically opposed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intentions of the originators of this legislation are even more irrefutable in terms of the finality of decisions. At our last Sitting I started to quote from the Explanatory Memorandum issued in conjunction with the 1945 Industrial Injuries Bill. On the determination of claims to benefit it says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Appeals will lie from the decision of the local Tribunal to an Industrial Injuries Commissioner whose decision will be final."</p></blockquote>
The Explanatory Memorandum, referring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
to assessment for pension and not for industrial injury benefit says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The workmen will have certain rights of appeal against the decision of the Medical Board to a Medical Appeal Tribunal and the decision of that Tribunal will be final."</p></blockquote>
All that is summed up in Section 50 of the 1965 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what does Clause 5 say? Subsection (1) provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provision … that the decision of a claim or question as there mentioned is to be final shall not make any finding of fact or other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision, or on which it is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further decision."</p></blockquote>
If that is not standing the original intention of the 1946 Act on its head, what is? What has been the effect of accepting the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the original legislation, and the interpretation which his Department has pursued through the courts with such ferocity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the widow of a man who has been awarded disablement benefit robbed of her death benefit—of which I gave a particularly nauseating example last time; a man like Mr. G. T. Jones, of Maesteg, whose case I dealt with in detail, who was awarded disablement benefit by one medical appeal tribunal in 1961, found that decision reversed by another medical tribunal 11 years later, when he claimed that aggravation had taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the result of interpreting the original finality of the decisions—a point set out in the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1945 Act—in the sense that the Department has always wanted and the hon. Gentleman is now trying to legalise in the Clause after a period of 11 years, one medical appeal tribunal's findings have been reversed by another medical anneal tribunal's findings. That is the situation that we are asked to sanctify in the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the word "sanctify". In the Second Reading debate the Secretary of State talked about the sanctity of medical decisions, and said that they ought not to be overthrown by a non-medical authority. I do not accent that formulation. But in the case of Mr. G. T. Jones the sanctity of medical decisions has gone through the window, and the Department claims the right to be synoptic about which medical decision it shall consider to be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a situation, what becomes of
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
the hon. Gentleman's other major argument, which formed the body of his reply last week—the argument that the criteria for disablement benefit have to be tougher than those for industrial injuries benefit? The hon. Gentleman made great play with this; it was, in fact, his only argument of any substance. He made a big point that the Government were actually trying to help claimants in the Clause. He said that if rulings on entitlement to industrial injury benefit were to be taken as binding on medical authorities which decided on entitlement to disablement benefit the claimant would suffer, because we like to pay industrial injury benefit with humane speed and that if we insisted on our interpretation of the law the payment of industrial injury benefit would be held up while expensive medical inquiries were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) put some very pertinent points to the hon. Gentleman on that question, and I hope they will be answered more effectively today. But even if we accepted that argument—and I certainly do not—it does not fit the case of Mr. G. T. Jones. That was a case where an award of disablement benefit was later queried. It has nothing to do with the relative importance of inquiries for industrial injury benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it does not fit the case of Mrs. Kingsnorth, which I spelt out in detail last Thursday. She was awarded a 30 per cent. disablement benefit for a detached retina. The award was not disputed by the Ministry and yet later, when the assessment was confirmed for life, the Ministry claimed the right to re-open the matter. It took Mrs. Kingsnorth and her union another four years to re-establish her right to the original award of disablement benefit. The hon. Gentleman has not begun to answer the cases that I put before the Committee, and which I could go on endlessly producing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Clause as drafted, those cases could presumably be re-opened endlessly. How does that fit in with the hon. Gentleman's argument at the last Sitting? He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of what the Opposition propose is that acceptance by the lay authorities in local social security offices of entitlement to injury benefits binds the later medical authorities in the event of the person's trouble not clearing up and his eventually applying for a long-term disablement benefit."—[OFFICIAL REPORT,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>

	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 6th July, 1972; 
	<i>c</i>. 394.]</p></blockquote>
The clear intention behind the hon. Gentleman's statement is to give the impression that when a man has an accident at work, and with all the qualifying formulae that he gave to us, some little clerk in the local social security office slaps on industrial injury benefit without any medical advice or experience, and yet even the insurance officer at the bottom end of the ladder of awards is experienced in these matters and is dealing with them all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that that sentence of the hon. Gentleman at our last Sitting does not touch the cases that I have put before the Committee, where a medical appeal tribunal—not a lay authority in a local social security office—found in favour of the claim and yet that was not held to be final and conclusive for future purposes. That is what is so iniquitous about the Clause. I appeal to the hon. Gentleman to think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to score a party political point over the hon. Gentleman. I appreciate that this is an abstruse matter, which has misled a succession of Ministers. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have the glory of being the first Minister to wake up to what is being done in his name and the name of his right hon. Friend and to say that the time has come to interpret the law positively on the lines of new Clauses 5 and 6. I ask him to reconsider the matter—to put to his advisers the questions that I am putting to him and get real answers to them. Let him then tell us, on Report, that he has had second thoughts and that he agrees with new Clause 6 that an accident declaration properly awarded by all the means of award laid down here should mean that a man has had an industrial accident. Otherwise, as Lord Hodson said in the House of Lords, an accident declaration is valueless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I ask the Minister to say, on Report, that he agrees with new Clause 5 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any finding of fact or other determination embodied in … the decision"</p></blockquote>
shall be
	<br><blockquote><p>"conclusive for the purpose of any further decision."</p></blockquote>
If he will do that, we shall be the first to applaud and thank him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
against monopolies—especially monopolies of debate in Standing Committees by front bench spokesman on either side, however eminent their past might have been or their future may be. My right hon. Friend has spoken, quite properly—in her view—for about an hour and a half on this Clause, quoting at length and verbatim the brief supplied by the trades unions, and she has left very little for the rest of us to say. But I intend to speak, and it will not be from a trade union brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The workman of today will find this Clause incomprehensible, as I do. He will not understand why a Clause of this kind should be in a Bill dealing with benefits and contributions. Nor do I. Whether it was slipped in by the Department, hoping that it would not be noticed or that we should debate the previous Clauses for so long that we should get fed up and vote it virtually on the nod, I do not know. However, it appals me to think that a Clause of this complexity, involving such basic principles, should be in a Bill of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My intervention will certainly be briefer than the speeches that we have heard to date from some quarters of the Committee. The debate has been almost like a woman's pregnancy, in length. I have no intention of belabouring the Minister—to continue the analogy—in this matter. I think that he is genuinely puzzled by this question, and he probably did not know why the Clause was in the Bill when he saw it drafted by those clever men behind the scenes. He has to defend it here as best as he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to a constituency case to illustrate the difficulties that the ordinary workman faces. I cite briefly the experiences of a Mr. G. Howie, of 87 Rimbleton Avenue, Glenrothes, Fife. A considerable time ago Mr. Howie was employed by Weir Pumps Ltd., of Glasgow—a very large and wealthy firm. In the course of his work he was using a hard steel hammer to strike another metal object—I think that it was called a flogging spanner. In the course of this activity a metal splinter flew into his eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the accident he was taken to hospital, where the injury was diagnosed as severe bruising and he was sent home. His condition worsened, and eventually he had to undergo major surgery. It was found that there was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
splinter in his eye, measuring one quarter of an inch by one-sixteenth of an inch by one sixty-fourth of an inch, and roughly rectangular in shape. Mr. Howie was not expected to wear goggles in this industrial operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not at first established that there was a metal particle in his eye at all, but at the instigation of the Amalgamated Engineering Union's solicitors, L. and L. Lawrence, of Glasgow, the fragment was examined by Dr. McLeod of the Department of Metallurgy at Strathclyde University. He examined the hardness of the steel in the hammer that Mr. Howie was using and also the hardness and micro-structure of the flogging spanner, and the standards laid down by British Standard 876.1964 and British Standard 3066.1959, respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter dated 24th November, 1971 Dr. McLeod said that in his opinion the fragment originated from the shank of the spanner. That being so, Dr. McLeod said that the possibility of success of a claim by Mr. Howie appeared doubtful, since the accident became a working risk, and because there were no regulations covering the wearing of goggles in these cases it was not an industrial injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. McLeod did not rate very highly the chances of a successful claim. He asked Weir Pumps to supply further information about the spanner. Weir Pumps supplied the spanner, and on 21st December, 1971, it was further examined by Dr. McLeod. He than changed his mind, and expressed the opinion that the chip of metal in Mr. Howie's eye did not originate from the spanner. A letter to Mr. Howie from his union's solicitors—Lawrence, of Glasgow—dated 28th December, 1971, said that Dr. McLeod's findings
	<br><blockquote><p>"virtually remove any prospect that your Employers are legally liable for the accident".</p></blockquote>
They held out no hope that a claim would be sustained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 10th February, 1972, a further letter came from the union's solicitors, who been in touch with the insurers of Weir Pumps. No headway had been made, and there was no proof of the origin of the steel fragment. Here was a fellow striking metal with metal: a piece of metal went into his eye, and no one knew where it came from. It came from mid-air. It was not an industrial accident.
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
Meanwhile, on 22nd May, 1972 the union's solicitors sent a further letter to Mr. Howie, indicating that the insurance company of Weir Pumps was not prepared to make any payment, 
	<i>ex gratia</i> or otherwise, since there was no fault or negligence on the part of the employer. The union's solicitors told Mr. Howie that they proposed to drop the claim and close the file.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am following with great attention what the hon. Gentleman is saying—which is extremely interesting and important—but I hope that he will relate it to the question of industrial injuries, which he has not mentioned so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have not, I shall. I shall mention it now, since you have asked me, Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going on to say that the lawyers advising the union told how he had pressed the matter on his own initiative. Meanwhile, his eyesight had been seriously impaired and he got a 30 per cent. benefit from the Department. That satisfies you, Sir Stephen, so you can relax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Howie is a young man. That 30 per cent. means about £2 a week. If he died I do not know whether his widow would get that sum for the rest of her life. In any event, it is inadequate for the injury that the man sustained. His employment prospects are impaired. His eyesight is getting worse, and there are side effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took legal advice on this matter from the highest quarters on both sides of the House. It was thought that Mr. Howie could claim under a common law action and get at least £2,000 in damages. I passed on that legal opinion to Mr. Howie. He took the matter up with his union, which promised to take further counsel's advice, but it held out no hope of a claim being sustained. These facts show the difficulty experienced by the workman in trying to get his rights. Anything that we may do in the Clause or in other legislation that makes it even more difficult for a workman, in the normal

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has had very little publicity in the newspapers, but there is a full report this morning in 
	<i>The Guardian</i>, which quotes my right hon. Friend's argument. The Government have made great play until now about the rule of law, saying that the unions should obey the Industrial Relations Act and the local authorities should obey the Housing Act and its rent provisions. The rule of law is paramount, but my right hon. Friend quoted the comment of a TGWU official on the Clause 5 proposal:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems that there is one law for the trade unions and one for the Government. Because we"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the union—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are accused of breaking the law and not accepting it, and a great song and dance is made even to the extent of placing the union in contempt of court. On the other hand, where the Government decide"—</p></blockquote>
as in this case—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a House of Lords decision"—</p></blockquote>
the highest court of appeal in the land—
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not suit their purposes, it is decided to change the law to suit themselves, thus bringing themselves into the position of disregarding the law whatever it is."</p></blockquote>
There is one law for the union and the worker and another law for the Government. If the Government do not like the law they take power to change it, even if the workman dies leaving a widow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We object to that principle in the Clause. I do not pretend to understand its intricacies, and I doubt whether many hon. Members understand them. I do not want to refer to my earlier point about pre-legislation committees, but this is a good case for them. We could discover what this implies in lay language, instead of having to ask trade union solicitors to give us guidance on the meaning for the ordinary workman. When the workman came to me I listened to his case and promised to raise it this morning in Committee, in the hope that the Minister would respond sympathetically and say that the Department, with its legal advice, would give the man assistance instead of appearing to persecute him because he struck one piece of metal against another and a bit of shrapnel went into his eye. The man's whole future is jeopardised, and everybody seems to be against him, including his union, which—I put it no higher—seems fairly indifferent. I use my
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
position here simply to raise this case and to point out the near impossibility of the ordinary workman's obtaining justice when it is plain that injustice has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady said that this matter had concerned all Administrations since the 1946 Act came into operation. It has become very clear this morning—perhaps clearer than when she spoke at our previous Sitting—that the right hon. Lady's real concern is not so much the present Clause as the interpretation of the original Act. The Government maintain that the Clause restores the position to what it was originally believed to be, whereas the right hon. Lady raises the wider concept of finality, and is proposing what we regard as fairly far-reaching changes in the industrial injuries scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be rather surprising if the highest court of appeal in the land, having adjudicated on this matter, said that it was highly probable that Parliament would feel it necessary to introduce new legislation if it was declaring the position that existed previously. It is unlikely that that would be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I think it unfair to quote individual cases to suggest that the Department, the medical authorities, or others, are trying their utmost to see that people do not receive their rights. That is certainly not so. As I told the Committee at our last Sitting, there are occasions when the Department refers cases which do not seem to be justified by the facts, whether the assessment appears too high or too low. The figures do not appear to suggest that the scales are weighted against the individual claimant. For example, the number of disablement benefit awards in 1971 was 135,000 and there were appeals in 13,000 of those cases, which is 9.6 per cent. The awards of death benefit totalled 1,900, and there were appeals to the Commissioner in 60 cases, which is 3.1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) quoted individual cases. I must be careful what I say about some of them, because they are still before the independent adjudication authorities. It is possible on almost any occasion to quote cases which appear on the surface to involve hard-hearted administrative action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
However, they are nearly always cases in which a very difficult medical decision has to be made and where understandable differences of view exist as to the medical merits of the case. Otherwise, it can be a question of disputes on points of law. The right hon. Lady quoted the Jones case. The claimant's solicitors repeatedly returned to persuade the Commissioner that the decisions of the tribunal were faulty, not on assessment but on points of law. I assure the Committee, however, that the cases quoted last week, and the case of Mr. Howie, which the hon. Gentleman has quoted today—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unwise for the hon. Gentleman to deal with the case of Mr. Howie because, as I understood it from the hon. Gentleman—whose argument I listened to with much interest—there is a possibility of its coming before the courts, and he did not raise with the Committee any questions about national insurance. It would therefore be inappropriate to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Sir Stephen. I will merely say that I intend to study that case and the others personally, with the greatest care. I have already begun to study the three cases that the right hon. Lady raised last week, and I shall study this one too, because it is only right and proper that I should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two main points on the main questions that the right hon. Lady raised again today. The first concerns the accident declaration procedure. The right hon. Lady said that the Clause 5 proposal substantially altered it. The position, as I understand it, is that in cases where an accident does not immediately result in incapacity or disablement a man can safeguard his future right to benefit by applying for a declaration that the accident was an industrial one. The circumstances of the accident will then be investigated in the normal way, and if the insurance officer is satisfied that it was industrial a declaration will be recorded and the papers retained for reference in the event of a subsequent claim. The industrial accident question will, therefore, not have to be raised again if a claim is later made in respect of that accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of the Clause the same procedure will apply, except that
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
the insurance officer will be able to make a declaration without having to concern himself with the question whether or not there was personal injury. The accident declaration will therefore continue to be conclusive evidence not only that the incident occurred but also that it was industrially caused. In the exceptional case in which the insurance officer is unable to differentiate between the incident and the injury, he will still be able to give an accident declaration that will be conclusive as to the circumstances. It will therefore be left for the medical authorities to decide in a disablement claim whether the injury itself was due to the work or to other causes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman refer back to the Dowling case? The commissioner, Mr. Nelson, gave Mr. Dowling an accident declaration, but that was not held to be conclusive. That was not just an insurance officer; it was the commissioner. Yet when Mr. Dowling applied for disablement benefit, the medical appeal tribunal reversed the accident declaration of the commissioner. It is because the House of Lords said that that was wrong that we have Clause 5. The House of Lords found in Mr. Dowling's favour, and the Government now want to put the law back against Mr. Dowling. Is the hon. Gentleman justifying a situation in which a commissioner's award of an accident declaration can later be challenged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, The important difference, which the right hon. Lady has probably not fully appreciated, is the distinction between an accident declaration being conclusive evidence that an incident occurred at work and, on the other hand, the point that she is making that it should follow from that that injury actually occurred. That is the distinction between the two. It was on that point, amongst others, that the Dowling case very largely turned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the centre of the argument because the hon. Gentleman is saying that the fact that the commissioner, Mr. Nelson, gave Mr. Dowling an accident declaration did not mean that an injury had been sustained at work, and yet at the same time he awarded him industrial injury benefit. How can he say then that he did not receive an injury
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
at work? It is that kind of incompatibility that is so aggravating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider very carefully what the right hon. Lady has said, but I am trying to convey to the Committee that I do not believe, on present advice, that the Clause will do anything other than maintain and declare the position that exists at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second main point that the right hon. Lady raised concerned finality. Here again, she claimed that we were substantially changing the law and quoted certain legal judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to quote many legal judgments, but the other side of the case is well summarised by Lord Diplock in the Jones and Hudson case. I quote a few sentences from what he said when he was going back to determine the original intention of Parliament when it passed the 1946 Act. This is how he summarised the position, dealing with the distinction between injury benefit and the long-term disablement or death benefit:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parliament must have contemplated that the insurance officer would normally accept as sufficient without further inquiry whatever description of the incapacitating injury appeared on the medical certificate signed by the claimant's own doctor, however detailed or summary as a diagnosis that description might be. But Parliament can hardly have contemplated that the acceptance of that diagnosis as justification for payment of injury benefit, it may be only for a single day, should affect conclusively the claimant's future rights to a different kind of benefit, disablement benefit, which might endure for the remainder of his life and which had not yet been the subject of any claim."</p></blockquote>
Leading on from that, the effect of the Opposition's proposals is that the initial decision shall be final and binding. The great disadvantage of that would be that in the event of favourable evidence—for either the claimant or his widow—coming up later, that evidence would be inadmissible and therefore would not be to the advantage of the claimant. That is the effect of the right hon. Lady's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the effect of the right hon. Lady's proposals whether she intends it or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If she says that she does not intend it, we are dealing with another situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that there is a review Clause in the 1965 Act. I referred to it at our last sitting. It provides that where fresh evidence arises that was not before the original body a review can be held, just as on assessment there can be a review of the amount of disability benefit in the light of unforeseen aggravation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that we are proposing would affect the review Clause, just as, presumably, the right hon. Gentleman's Clause 5 would not affect it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the right hon. Lady's intention, but it is not how I read the new Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go an arguing about these highly refined legal matters now. On the last occasion when we discussed this highly technical matter I said that I would give the fullest consideration to all that had been said. I repeat that firm commitment today. I have already begun a full examination of all that has been said, and I intend to proceed with it, because I am sure that there are lessons that any Government—and all of us—can learn from this valuable debate. The Committee will realise that I cannot give any firm commitment as to the outcome, but I give the firm assurance that the process of full examination of the points made will be continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made that general commitment I want to make two other specific commitments. First, we intend to press on with the prescribed diseases. That is the part of the Industrial Injuries Act that has hitherto created most interest for those concerned. Brucellosis is being prescribed as a new industrial disease as from the 31st July of this year. Five other questions are now being considered, and we shall do our utmost to advance the frontiers in this all-important area of prescribed industrial diseases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other specific commitment that I wish to make to the Committee relates to death benefit, to which the right hon. Lady referred on Thursday. The Government accept that in that type of case a lack of finality can produce results unsatisfactory to the fair-minded person. This is the kind of case exemplified in Decision R (I) 11/61 which the right hon. Lady mentioned at the last sitting, where, although the medical authorities had accepted that the claimant's hernia
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
was due to the accident and awarded him 100 per cent. disablement benefit, the commissioner on a claim for death benefit took the view that the hernia was constitutional and rejected the death claim benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a rare type of case. The opposite type of situation may occur more frequently—the case where the medical authorities decide that a condition is not due to the accident but the insurance officer, local tribunal or commissioner takes a different view on the death benefit claim and death benefit is accordingly awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I can well see that to a fair-minded layman it is unjust that where disablement benefit has been paid, perhaps for years, for a certain condition and the beneficiary dies of that condition, industrial death benefit can be refused. Accordingly, on Report the Government are prepared to bring forward an Amendment to the Clause which will deal with that situation. In effect it will bind the lay statutory authorities to accept for the purposes of death benefit a condition for which the deceased is entitled to disablement benefit at the time of his death. It will still be necessary for the lay statutory authorities to be satisfied that death was due to that condition—that is the fundamental requirement for industrial death benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment will deal with the kind of situation with which Decision R (I) 11/61 was concerned. Such an Amendment will be more beneficial than the Opposition Amendment in the cases referred to. Under the Opposition Amendment the commissioner dealing with a death benefit claim would be unable to accept that a condition was due to the accident if earlier adjudicating authorities had thought that it did not. He can do that now, and he will be able to continue to do so under the Clause, amended as proposed. The Amendment will be fully beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are grateful for the debate that we have had on this somewhat technical Clause, and I hope that in view of the expressions of good will that I have expressed on behalf of the Government to give the matter full consideration and also the commitment that I have given to an Amendment on Report in the case of the death benefit claims, the Committee will feel that it is appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
that the Clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sidney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) was citing a case in which, under common law, a man could claim for damages against his employer. Nevertheless, does not the Minister agree that over that whole field there is gross dissatisfaction and injustice in deciding whether an employer could reasonably have foreseen the prospects of such an accident occurring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is exactly the point that I was trying to guide the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) away from. I hope that the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but I should like to have the Minister's reaction because when one is constantly studying these matters it is not possible to keep entirely within the purview of the national insurance system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that all hon. Members on this side thank my hon. Friend and welcome his remarks. There are still one or two points which he has not entirely cleared up, although I know that we shall support him in his offer of a review and we are extremely grateful for the concessions that he has made on the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that the review will necessarily be a long one, and may not be complete by Report. I hope that my hon. Friend will realise that the matter will not be forgotten, however. It is something that we shall expect to see resurrected, in some other form, in the life of this Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point on prescribed diseases is a very good one. That is the aspect on which the maximum number of complaints have occurred. A way must be found of making it quite certain that the workman who suffers as a result of the work that he is doing is compensated. Negligence seems to be immaterial in industrial compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the point made by the right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
hon. Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle). She said that we are expecting a finality of decision with regard to the etiology of any disease, and that she is not asking for finality in the size of the award. Once we have decided that an accident has occurred and have decided on the etiology of that accident, and once we have decided on the nature of the disease which has been occasioned by that accident, finality is necessary if justice is to be done. The review clause allows the award to be upgraded or downgraded—and one hopes that there will be no complaints if it is occasionally downgraded. It is the finality of the etiology and diagnosis that must be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the concession on the death clause is right and just, and is gratefully accepted. We must say clearly not only whether death is due to that condition but whether it is due wholly or partly to that condition. In the case raised by the right hon. Member for Blackburn the pulmonary embolus death was due only partially to that disease. We want to see that people are covered whether their death is partially or totally due to accident, and we ought finally to say whether death is a consequence of the accident. We must have the sequel as well as the disease, and we must have the point about "partially or completely" included in the concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) for the backing of his medical expertise in these matters. Of course, he is right. We are not saying that there can never be a review of an assessment of the extent of disablement. I pointed out that the review Section of the 1965 Act allows for that. I am also extremely grateful to the Minister for his promise to give us a fundamental reconsideration of the matter before Report. All members of the Opposition welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad that the hon. Gentleman has already made a specific commitment on death benefit. I endorse entirely what the hon. Member for Norwich, South said about that. I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that it is a little unfair to say that what he proposes goes farther than we ask. He knows perfectly well that we have no parliamentary draftsmen to help us draft our new Clauses. What we were seeking was quite clear from the speech
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
that I made. If the Government accept the content and merits of our arguments it is for them to put the matter in proper legislative form. It is not for us to draft the perfect Amendment or new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the review point, the hon. Member for Norwich, South raised a very important question. Many matters are associated with the examination of the industrial injuries scheme. One was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). Another was in a new Clause that we put down about injury by process, which the Chair did not feel able to select.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman proceeds to consider the whole question of justice in the working of this scheme he will find himself searching even wider areas. I hope that he will consider the "injury by process" point, and the point raised by my hon. Friend. Can it be done between now and Report? Everyone in the Committee recognises that there is a certain urgency about the Bill. The uprating Bill must be through in time for the uprating to be paid. We do not want to prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asks us to accept the Clause because of his assurances. The Clause clarifies the law in a certain direction, which the Committee seems to think is a regressive direction. Pending a far-reaching review, is it really fair to ask the Committee to clarify the law in the very opposite direction to that which the Committee wishes it to take? I am not suggesting that our new Clauses represent the ideal formulation of clarification, but the hon. Gentleman ought to be telling us this morning that the Government will withdraw the Clause pending the completion of a review. If that review cannot be completed by Report, the Minister should tell us that the Clause will not go into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The desire of the Committee is that the Clause in this form should not go into the Bill. Is it not still possible to withdraw the Clause? Grateful though we are to the Minister for agreeing to a review, I must tell him that we could not let the Clause go through unchallenged in this regressive form. Indeed, his whole willingness to meet us on this point shows that it would be very wrong to put the Clause on the Statute Book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT 1971</div> <!-- title -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 3(2) of the National Insurance Act 1971 shall cease to have effect, and a person who but for the application of that subsection would be entitled to invalidity pension shall become so entitled on the appointed day."—[
	<i>Mr. O'Malley.</i>]</p></blockquote>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time. The Committee will be aware that the National Insurance Act, 1971 introduced a new benefit—the invalidity benefit—which was payable to claimants who previously, under the national insurance system, after a period of 168 days, continued under certain circumstances to be entitled to sickness benefit, although at that time, at the end of six months the earnings-related element of sickness benefit disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Section 3 of the National Insurance Act, 1971, the Government, with the support of the Opposition, introduced the principle of invalidity benefit and the invalidity allowance that was payable according to the age of the recipient and which replaced sickness benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I quote briefly from Section 3(1) and (2) of the National Insurance</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>

	<p>what I am sure the whole Committee would regard as an improvement to the Clause, and in view of that clear expression of good will and the firm commitment to bring forward an Amendment on Report, I hope that the Committee will feel able to accept the Clause.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put</i>, That Clause 5 stand part of the Bill:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 7.</p>

	<p>Act, 1971. Section 3(1) provided that</p>

	<p>after:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person has been entitled to sickness benefit for 168 days,"—</p></blockquote>
that person should—
	<br><blockquote><p>"cease to be entitled to that benefit for any subsequent day of incapacity for work falling within that period;"—</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>and that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless he is over pensionable age and has retired from regular employment, he shall be entitled to an invalidity pension for any day of incapacity for work in that period for which, by virtue of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) above, he is not entitled to sickness benefit".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Section 3(2) modified and restricted the provisions of subsection (1). Subsection (2) provided that the invalidity benefit payable under subsection (1) should not be payable unless the person making the claim had paid
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of the period between his entry into insurance and that day,"—</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>that is, the day of the claim—
	<br><blockquote><p>"less than 156 contributions of the appropriate class, and accordingly, subject to the provisions of the Insurance Act, that person shall continue to be entitled to sickness benefit for that day."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>New Clause 2 would widen the availability of the invalidity benefit against a background in which two separate debates are taking place amongst those who are interested in the operation of the national insurance system. The first argument that is relevant to the new Clause is the one relating to the question how far the national insurance system should continue to be a contributory system, or how far it should be opened up to provide benefits
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
for claimants who have not paid into the system at all—or, if they have paid, have paid only a limited number of contributions.</p>

	<p>There are those in the House and outside it who argue that the national insurance system is not a system of insurance at all and that one should do away with the whole fiction that insurance conditions exist, and that however one raises the money—through a health tax or through the Exchequer—payments should not be made to claimants on an insurance basis.</p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>I hold the more general view—and I think that the majority of Members of the House have held this view since the Beveridge Report—that the social system should remain largely an insurance system, albeit with the reservations that exist within the system, which allow the opposition to this point of view to say that it is not really a national insurance system at all. I hold the view that it is wise, sensible and useful that a high degree of insurance benefit-type payments should be contained within the social security system. At the same time, without destroying the national insurance principle, one can cater for categories of people who could not reasonably be expected to be able to make substantial payments into the national insurance scheme.</p>

	<p>It was against that kind of debating background that the attendance allowance was debated in this House after it had been pushed by the Disablement Income Group. Eventually it was decided that the attendance allowance was not a national insurance benefit at all, although it operates within the general social security structure.</p>

	<p>In considering the new Clause we have to bear in mind the general argument about the way in which we should treat the national insurance principle. That principle is reduced in importance, at least in this area, as a result of the principles underlying the new Clause. Nevertheless, it does not destroy the national insurance principle; it merely argues that there are certain categories of people who do not have and will not have the opportunity to make substantial national insurance contributions. Therefore, we must ask ourselves whether we are justified in making benefits payable to people who have not
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
made the necessary number of contributions because of their particular circumstances.</p>

	<p>The second general argument that is relevant to the new Clause concerns the position of the disabled in society generally. In debates over the last few years hon. Members of both sides of the House have stated quite openly that had it not been for the efforts of the Disablement Income Group the provisions for disabled people might not have been in existence to the degree that they are. The attendance allowance was sold hard to both parties by the Disablement Income Group, and it reached the Statute Book. We all welcome it, and acknowledge the enormous importance of the efforts of the Group in creating a climate of opinion in which the attendance allowance was accepted by successive Governments and put into legislative form.</p>

	<p>The Disablement Income Group says that there is an overwhelming case for a national disablement income, for example, for congenital disability and for the disabled housewife. Members of the Committee will have seen the occasional paper published by the Disablement Income Group called "Creating a National Disability Income", which I need not quote at length. On moral grounds society has a responsibility towards these substantial numbers of disabled people. The social security system does not adequately meet their needs.</p>

	<p>According to Section 3(2) of the 1971 Act, unless a person has made 156 contributions he is not entitled to receive invalidity pension and, according to age, invalidity allowance and the other advantages which exist for the wife and children. The new Clause seeks to get rid of subsection (2), which restricts the number of people who can receive it.</p>

	<p>Therefore, we are entitled to ask—in addition to the specific proposal of new Clause 2—whether it is reasonable that the contribution condition should be 156 payments made during three years at work. What is the position of a young person entering employment who, because of some degree of congenital disablement, is unable to make the 156 contributions? What is the position of the disabled housewife? The new Clause seeks to remove the implications of Section 3(2) of the National Insurance Act, 1971, and enables a person to receive the invalidity pension
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
and allowance regardless of whether he or she had paid 156 contributions.</p>

	<p>Hon. Members may wish to expand on this and to consider the various categories of people who, due to disablement, are unable to meet the contribution condition. The new Clause extends the availability of the invalidity pension to a degree that is reasonable under all circumstances. It does not destroy the viability of any philosophical basis of the insurance contribution principle.</p>

	<p>If the hon. Gentleman cannot meet exactly the conditions in new Clause 2, will he consider before Report whether the Government are correct to stipulate 156 contributions or whether they could be more helpful to disabled people? In considering the new Clause, the Committee should take account of the Disablement Income Group's proposals, which I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"1. Nobody should be outside the scope of National Insurance in such a serious event as invalidity.

	<ol>

	<li>Handicapped children who are unable to work when they reach working age should become entitled to an invalidity pension as a birthright.</li>

	<li>For people in the labour force who contribute fully to the National Insurance scheme, cover against invalidity should be put on the same footing as cover against industrial injury—i.e. it should always be available (subject to any necessary safeguards) regardless of the length of time they have been working.</li>

	<li>Married women who are housewives or who, if employed, are only contributing for cover against industrial injury should be covered against invalidity on their husbands' insurance in the same way that they are insured for a retirement pension."</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>The Disablement Income Group is now putting forward these views. It is with the background of these views and with the background of the debate now taking place on disability and on the nature of the National Insurance system that I recommend the Committee to consider the new Clause.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the existing rules, people who have paid fewer than 156 employed or self-employed contributions qualify for sickness benefit for up to 312 days interruption of employment, but nothing else. Those who have paid at least 156 contributions are entitled to invalidity benefit after they have been entitled to sickness benefit for 165 days—that is effectively six months in a period of interruption of employment. In the new Clause the hon. Gentleman asks for
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
the abolition of the 156 contributions paid test for invalidity pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification up to now for the 156 contributions paid test is that it has long been accepted that the payment of 156 flat-rate contributions is a reasonable minimum basis for entitlement to the long term benefits of retirement pension, widow's pension and, now, invalidity benefit. These benefits are very valuable because they are life-long. It has been felt hitherto that three years of contributions are not inappropriate as a premium to be paid to secure them. The contribution required is minimal, which most people can meet. Those who are unable to meet it are usually either congenitally disabled or people who have been in employment for only a short time and have not had the opportunity of six months in employment to qualify themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been the position for some time. Nevertheless, the concept of entitlement to invalidity benefit automatically after six months on sickness benefit in all cases has been accepted by the Government. It is part of our proposals for the reconstruction of the national insurance scheme, which appeared in the White Paper entitled "Strategy for Pensions". In other words, the hon. Gentleman is saying that paragraph 50 in "Strategy for Pensions", which deals with this point, is acceptable and that we should advance the date of its implementation. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his generous tribute to "Strategy for Pensions". It is very good of him to encourage us in his usual fair-minded way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote the last sentence of paragraph 50 of the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For invalidity benefit, entitlement will follow automatically where a sick person remains incapable of work after more than six months of sickness benefit."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are changing, modifying and making easier the contribution conditions in "Strategy for Pensions" and in the legislation which we hope to put before Parliament in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The great defect of the hon. Gentleman's proposals is that the benefit is at a flat rate. The Government are going over to earnings-related contributions with flat-rate benefits. That is the great catch and it is why a number of

	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I was keeping strictly to the paths of virtue because I was talking about contributions, which are the subject of the new Clause. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about the contribution conditions. I do not think that I should be tempted to widen the debate to include something not relevant to the proposal before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about the national insurance principle and the value of preserving it. We are at one with him on that. I should prefer to call it the contributory rather than the insurance principle, because the insurance principle suggests something which is understood in the commercial world as an insurance policy which is taken out and which in due course matures and produces a benefit for which one has paid in. The national insurance scheme, on the other hand, is a pay-as-you-go system and what is paid in today in contributions is paid out tomorrow in benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, then, dealing with a valuable contributory principle which we intend to preserve and which gives a title to a benefit. If the hon. Gentleman suggests, as he did when we were speaking of disability incomes, that there should be no contribution conditions at all, he is proposing the complete undermining of the contributory principle which a few minutes ago he was recommending. I do not wish to quibble, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the question of disability incomes is well outside the specific proposal which he is making in the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the basic intention underlying the new Clause, which we ourselves proposed in "Strategy for Pensions", but we feel that it would be unwise to try to change the contribution conditions piecemeal. The appropriate way to do it is as part of the reconstruction of the scheme. I therefore express agreement with the general intention of the hon. Gentleman's new Clause and confirm that we intend something very similar in the reconstruction of the scheme, but I suggest that it would be unwise to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
alterations piecemeal and that this should form part of the main reform which we shall be putting before Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to misquote me and I think that, when he reads my speech, he will see that throughout I stressed the importance of the national insurance or, as he describes it—I think, better—contributory principle and that I confined my remarks to the arguments for a general disability income without committing the party for which I speak to a complete move away from the national insurance principle. All I said was that successive Governments had found it sensible and possible to move away from the contributory principle in certain areas and that one should consider that general debate when looking at this specific proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is not what the hon. Gentleman promises for the future which concerns me. The Prime Minister promised many things in the 1970 election and look what has happened. I shall not enlarge on that, as I am sure I should meet with your displeasure, Sir Stephen. However, when the hon. Gentleman says that the Government have good intentions but that they are not prepared to do anything about them at present that does not satisfy me. I see no reason why the Government should not take action piecemeal, as the hon. Gentleman calls it. This is a National Insurance Bill. What is Clause 5, which is a very doubtful proposition indeed, about but some piecemeal change in the structure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that, although the hon. Gentleman says he agrees with me, he is not prepared to do anything. I am prepared to support the principle now, but the hon. Gentleman says that his Government are prepared to support it only at some time in the future, should they be in office. In the circumstances, mildly as the Minister replied to my proposal, I advise my hon. Friends, and I ask hon. Gentlemen opposite, to support the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extremely important and arresting fact underlies the new Clause and it will determine the greater part of what I have to say. It is a fact which has been true for many years but which has been aggravated by particularly high levels of unemployment that only slightly over half the number of unemployed persons—and this is also true of unemployed men—receive help from national insurance benefits during times of unemployment. Despite the recent rapid rise in unemployment, and despite the fact that many of the unemployed must have excellent contribution records, the proportion of persons—and again I include the proportion of men—who are unemployed and who are receiving unemployment benefit has fallen in the last few years. For the last four quarters for which information is available, only 52.1 per cent. of the total number of unemployed were receiving unemployment benefit. For men only, the proportion was only slightly higher, at 54.6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is a sombre and arresting fact that only just over half those unemployed at present and rather worse at a period of particularly high unemployment are receiving unemployment benefit. Let me hasten to add, in case any hon. Member thinks that there are technical reasons for this, that this figure excludes younger workers who have not yet had sufficient time to pay enough contributions to make them eligible. One has to pay 156 Class 1 contributions, but these figures exclude those
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
persons who have not had that time, as well as married women who have opted, as they are entitled to do, not to pay contributions but to rely on their husbands' insurance. The fact, therefore, is stark. It is not explained by the conventional explanation of a few years ago: the low levels of unemployment, with a large number of marginal workers in and out of work with very little established work record, for the percentage has not changed. Indeed, it has risen during a period of particularly high unemployment. It is obviously explained by the large and increasing number of workers who have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now reached the stage in this country where more than one in six of the unemployed have been unemployed for more than a year. The proportion has decreased slightly in the last two years, but that is because of the large increase in the number of persons made unemployed for the first time. As that number declines, the number of long-term unemployed—those unemployed for more than a year—will be seen to increase. In absolute numbers, this is a growing body of men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the long-term unemployed, there are those who have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit because of repeated brief spells of unemployment. To my knowledge, the exact number is not known. The number of male heads of households who have been unemployed for long periods, particularly of over a year, and have therefore exhausted their right to benefit is now very large and growing. This is especially serious because, for reasons which I think are well-known, it affects older workers who find it more difficult to return to work when the unemployment situation eases. It also especially affects—for the same reason, that fewer vacancies are available in those areas—those in the worst-hit regions: the regions of chronic-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
ally high unemployment where the differential is maintained at times when the national average unemployment level worsens. One thinks particularly of Scotland, the Northern Region, and Wales. It is the long-term unemployed in those areas, and in the higher age groups, who are the special concern of the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, I hasten to add, quite apart from the fact that, even among those who are not receiving unemployment benefit, there is a significant minority receiving only reduced unemployment benefit. Probably one-fifth even of those entitled to and receiving unemployment benefit do not receive their full entitlement, because of temporary withdrawals or disallowances for one or another technical reason. The figure of one-fifth comes from a 1964 survey which, to my knowledge, is the only one done in the last decade on that point. It was a small survey, but there is no reason to suppose that the figures are much different now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very bleak situation in which men, through no fault of theirs but because of an economic policy which has, rightly or wrongly—I do not wish to enter into a debate on economics—permitted the number of unemployed to rise, are bearing the brunt of it. It is the purpose of the new Clause essentially to safeguard their rights, at least to an extension of insurance benefit. When they have been insured throughout their working lives, at least at such a time as this the stigma of means testing ought not to be forced upon them because of an economic policy over which they have no control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use the Government saying that other forms of protection are available. There are, first, redundancy payments. But, although one concedes that the total sums paid out in redundancy payments are considerable, the contribution which they make to easing unemployment—the goal of the new Clause—is very small, because a relatively small proportion of the work force receives them and because their effect is reduced the longer a man is unemployed. By the time a man is unemployed for over a year—these are the people who are the concern of the new Clause—the redundancy payments are largely irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other possibility, which will no
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
doubt be mentioned, is that people may have recourse to supplementary benefit. But it is precisely the object of the new Clause to protect people who, through no fault of their own, are long-term unemployed—there is no suggestion, I believe, on either side of the Committee that there is any malingering by people who have been unemployed for that length of time—from the necessity of claiming supplementary benefit. They should not be forced in such a situation to make the stigmatising revelation of their private income in order to receive a meagre benefit. Having been insured over a period of years, they should be entitled to unemployment benefit as of right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But not even all of those who are unemployed and not receiving unemployment benefit receive supplementary benefit. It is at the heart of our case that one-sixth of the unemployed and about two-fifths of the unemployed not receiving unemployment benefit do not receive supplementary benefit either. One may conjecture about the reasons for this, but the figures are well established, and I was given them in a parliamentary answer which I shall quote later. It is no use saying that supplementary benefit is available for the long-term unemployed. In the first place, it is not wanted. In the second place, they do not receive it anyway in a large number of cases; the total is over 100,000 at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, with regard to supplementary benefit, the entitlement was deliberately reduced, I have to admit, by the previous Government, and that policy has been continued by the present Government. I refer to the existence of the four-week rule. That withholds the entitlement to supplementary benefit—"entitlement" presumably takes on a rather odd meaning in that case—under Schedule 2 of the Ministry of Social Security Act, 1966, in the case of single persons and also of married persons in certain situations. There are now over 250,000 persons who have lost their entitlement to supplementary benefit under the four-week rule, despite the fact that, when the rule was introduced, the Government excluded certain areas from the application of the rule because the unemployment rate was high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have argued elsewhere that, because the unemployment rate is now, almost everywhere in the country, above the level
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
it had reached in those excluded areas in 1968, by the rule which operated originally all those areas ought to be excluded from the operation of the four-week rule. Perhaps this is another instance of one rule for the Government and another for the trade unions, because what was convenient in 1968 is no longer found convenient today, and the rule continues to operate in large areas of the country. So it is no use the Government saying that there is no need to extend entitlement to flat-rate or earnings-related unemployment benefit because of entitlement to supplementary benefit; it is not wanted, it often is not obtained, and in a large and growing number of cases there is exclusion from the entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have indicated, the purpose of the new Clause is to protect workers who lose their jobs and are unable to return to a job because of the operation of national economic policy. They have a right of protection against the stigma of means testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to add, because it was certainly part of our thinking when we put forward this Clause, that we appreciate that the changes which are envisaged here should not necessarily be permanent changes. Clearly the situation, for all the reasons I have given, is considerably worse at a time of chronically high unemployment. Although this is not written into the Clause, for good reasons, certainly the strength of our feeling is limited to a situation where unemployment is over, say, half a million or 600,000. Although there are good reasons for extending flat rate unemployment benefit anyway, clearly the arguments for doing so are much the greater when there are over 500,000 or over 750,000 unemployed and, therefore, an increasing proportion of long-term unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of high unemployment is shown in two ways. First, the absolute numbers of those who receive neither unemployment nor supplementary benefit have increased. Secondly, the proportion of the total unemployed who receive one or the other has gone down. My source for this is a very helpful parliamentary answer which I received from the Under-Secretary on 16th March, 1972. It revealed—and these are critical figures from the point of view of the new Clause—that the total of male unemployed, which, of course, is less than the total
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
for men and women but is the most serious hard core, in 1967 was 447,000. The number not receiving unemployment benefit was 184,000 and the number receiving neither unemployment benefit nor supplementary benefit was 84,000. I wonder how these people survive. By 1971 the figure of total male unemployed was 686,000. The number not receiving unemployment benefit had risen to 304,000—nearly a third of a million last year and probably over a third now—and the number not receiving either unemployment benefit or supplementary benefit had risen to 118,000 men, and probably about 130,000 if one includes women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are surely extremely high figures. We are not talking about a small number but about several hundred thousand men, long-term unemployed, through no fault or intention of theirs, who cannot get a job but have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit. Is that right? Is this something which we ought to allow to continue? Is it not an entitlement that we ought to resurrect by extending the period when unemployment remains high until it falls below a certain level? Should we not retain the entitlement to a national insurance benefit as of right?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are the figures high but what is particularly alarming is that as the numbers of male unemployed have risen, so the proportion not in receipt of unemployment benefit has also risen. In 1967 the proportion of men who were unemployed and not receiving unemployment benefit was 41 per cent. By 1971, the year for which we have the latest figures, it had risen to 45 per cent., and now presumably it is a percentage or two above that level. Conceivably, as the number of short-term unemployed is reduced and as the employment market eases, the figure for the long-term unemployed may go over 50 per cent. This is an extremely serious situation. I believe that we are able to counter it and clearly we ought to counter it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a part of the new Clause to which I have not referred, and that is the earnings-related supplement part. We suggest that the earnings-related supplement should be extended from the present six-month period to a year. I should like to indicate why we think that ought to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, according to the latest figures, barely a third of those with unemploy-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
ment benefit are receiving the earnings-related supplement. This is an extremely small proportion. It is in many cases more valuable than the flat-rate benefit, it more than doubles it in a significant number of cases. The cut-off point after six months has nothing to do with need. Clearly it is those who are unemployed for longer than six months, as their other resources dry up and as their psychological resistance to this most harsh time of their lives probably decreases, whose need for increased money is greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have very little information about the size of additions in earnings-related supplement received by men at different earnings levels. We know the entitlements for a man at a given earnings level to earnings-related supplement, according to the regulations. What we do not know is how many men at different earnings levels claim and are in receipt of earnings-related supplements at particular levels. So far as I know, the Department of Employment has never published these statistics. What we do know—and this is significant and is a cause for considerable concern about the earnings-related supplement—is that the lowest paid workers pay in contributions, which they are obliged to do if their earnings are above a certain level, but they do not receive benefits in line with the level of their contributions. This is because of the 85 per cent. ceiling rule. They are not entitled to receive more than 85 per cent. of their earning power taking into account both the flat rate for themselves, their wife and children and the earnings-related supplement part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one includes the flat rate part for the man, wife and children and adds on the earnings-related supplement part, then it is easy to see that for low paid workers their entitlement with the earnings-related supplement is greater than their previous low earnings. Therefore, many low paid workers do not receive their full entitlement to the earnings-related supplement. This is a cause for considerable concern, although the point is not wholly covered by the new Clause. We feel that not only ought the period to be extended but that the operation of the earnings-related supplement ought to be looked into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be very brief about the third point I want to make. A number of other workers do not receive earnings-related supplement because of previous spells of
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
unemployment or sickness benefit. If one has had successive spells of being off work; then one is not entitled in some cases to earnings-related supplement; in other cases, it is reduced. In other words, the conditions for receipt of earnings-related supplement are very stringent and operate against those with a number of previous periods out of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial point in this new Clause, apart from these other considerations about why it operates, in our view, rather unsatisfactorily, is that, first, the cut-off point at the end of six months is not related to need and the longer a man is unemployed the more he needs the extra resource which he would receive from the earnings-related supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the importance of the earnings-related supplement is that for many families, unless they receive the earnings-related topping-up, the level of their unemployment benefit by itself often does not take them above the supplementary benefit line. Either they do not claim supplementary benefit, or they are obliged to claim a means-tested supplement, which for many decent, hard-working families in unemployment is an imposition which they will not accept. The point about extending the earnings-related supplement is that it would take a significant number of families above the supplementary benefit line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are our reasons for the new Clause. First and crucially, only half the unemployed workers get unemployment benefit, and as the level and length of unemployment grow the proportion of total unemployed who receive unemployment benefit is declining. Secondly, we want to protect those who are necessarily penalised by national considerations in economic policy from consequences over which they have no control and for which they ought not to suffer. We propose to do this by ensuring that they are not obliged to seek a mean-tested supplement, which in their situation is often regarded as a stigma, even if they are willing to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, unemployment benefit is often not enough by itself because it leaves families in unemployment below the supplementary benefit poverty line. An extension of the earnings-related supplement would take virtually all of these families above this line which at a time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
of unemployment in a society as rich as ours is surely the least that we can do. For these reasons, I commend the new Clause to the Committee, and I hope that the Government will feel able to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The admirable speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) made the case for extending the period of earnings-related benefit and the period coupled with it in this new Clause for flat rate benefit before means-testing arrangements are made. It might have seemed that his reference to the 85 per cent. cut-off was irrelevant. It might be irrelevant in that we are now discussing a new Clause which affects only one aspect of the Bill, but it is certainly affected by the morals of the situation for the lower paid worker—[

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) tries to keep his remarks 
	<i>sotto voce</i>, I assure him that they are more 
	<i>voce</i> than 
	<i>sotto.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My horror that you, Sir Stephen, were calling me to order appears to have been unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 85 per cent. cut-off is brought about because as a society, and in our national insurance system, we do not wish to see a worker who has dependent relatives and children better off unemployed than being at work. There is considerable argument and discussion as to whether that is morally justifiable. However, I will leave that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic unemployment benefit rate stands at about the same rate as that for the single pensioner and it is going up on 2nd October, together with the other increases in national insurance benefits. I shall probably be moving an Amendment concerning the period of the payment of the old-age pension and the same argument will apply when we consider the value of the £6 compared with the £6.75. This debate is mainly about periods of entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The earnings-related benefit, in my view, was one of the most revolutionary breakthroughs made by the Labour Government, but it does not necessarily mean that we should be static when thinking in terms of time. It was introduced in order to facilitate what was described loosely by some economists as a "shake-
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
out". The Leader of the Opposition gave voice to that horrible term. I always thought that that was a rotten term to apply to the use of human beings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency in the South of England not too far from this place where we do not have deep anxiety about long-term unemployment as yet. Everybody is apprehensive and fidgety, and councils of action against unemployment are being formed all over the South of England. However, if unemployment increases, surely we should never seek to cheapen it by not accepting the possibility of extending the period of insurance benefit as regards the flat-rate and the earnings-related entitlements. I hope that this is not in the Government's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a welcome sign running in parallel with the extraordinarily high unemployment situation. The Reports by the Government Actuary must be in our minds when we are looking at the Bill. They allude to the Bill and say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rate of unemployment and the level of earnings are two factors which have a material effect on the finances of the scheme, but are not susceptible to actuarial assessment."</p></blockquote>
The Government Actuary has assumed, for the purposes of illustration,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… that unemployment will be at the average level experienced in the calendar year 1971 when the number registered as unemployed averaged about 800,000) and that earnings will rise from October 1972 at the average rate of the last five years."</p></blockquote>
Of course, there is a relativity between the pensioners' situation and the chap next door with that of the worker who is unfortunately unemployed and suffering the stigma to which my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) has alluded. When he moves out of earnings related unemployment benefit, and finds that he cannot live adequately he has to get something by way of supplemental benefit. If the Government's view of economic events is correct they expect to see a continuing decline in unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the paradox in our economy of a higher rate of productivity with fewer workers. However, we know when we look at the world scene that that is not good enough and that we have to put every able-bodied worker, especially skilled workers, into the boat to row. We hope that the 800,000 unemployment average of 1971 will be drastically cur-

	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
tailed. Many of us were very unhappy about the growth of unemployment up to the figure of 600,000 under the Labour Government, which was an entirely unacceptable level of unemployment. There is no serious level of unemployment which is acceptable. I hope that the Government will not think in terms of having a continuous pool of unemployment for which benefits of this kind will be necessary on an extending scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the estimated 800,000 unemployment in 1971 is to be drastically curtailed, and if devaluation pays off by resuscitating British manufacturing industries by lowering the price, although adding to the cost of living, a paradoxical sitution will result. Devaluation provides the Government with the opportunity to cut unemployment, thereby decreasing the liability on national insurance funds. On the other hand, because of higher prices for imports the cost of living is increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I clarify the point about the Government Actuary's figures and the estimates that he is asked by the Government to make. It is customary to take the current figures for those estimates, but there is no significance in those figures from the point of view of Government assessment of what is likely to happen to unemployment during the period concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Actuary refers to that, and I hope that he will prove to be wrong. It is not the kind of figure that any Government would want. I do not care whether this Government survive, but I do not want them to go down in total economic collapse, in terms of selling our goods abroad, but there is an acute danger of that occurring, because we all know that the Prime Minister has run out of ideas. He said so at the Tory Women's Conference. However, we should not be too depressed about that, because he might learn that he has to rethink the position. That may be why he is having feverish meetings with the CBI and the TUC; he wants to have a new look at the battle with inflation. Inflation hits all the supposed beneficiaries of the Bill, not least the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difficulty. We have to shake up British industry in order to achieve a higher growth rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
Gentleman knows that I hate interrupting him, because he always makes interesting speeches, but it is my duty as Chairman to keep the debate within the confines of order. On this rather narrow new Clause it is inappropriate to have a wide-ranging economic debate. If I permit the hon. Gentleman to start one I shall only invite others to follow him and challenge the Under-Secretary to deal with his arguments. We have before us a new Clause extending to one year the period during which earnings-related benefit should be paid and to eighteen months the period during which flat-rate benefits should be paid. Hon. Gentlemen should try to stick strictly to the terms of the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point, Sir Stephen. I am trying to show that the Government Members of the Committee and the Conservative Party as a whole no longer have any faith in the idea of a pool of unemployment. It is relevant to the situation, because if the rate is to be reduced the possibility of providing the necessary finances to meet the terms of the new Clause will grow stronger and stronger. I hope that earnings-related benefit and flat-rate unemployment benefit will not be related to these two static periods. It may have been appropriate at the time when it was brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, although it does not wholly meet our point, the new Clause works towards the Labour Party's idea that in a properly-arranged society, with properly-arranged employment, there will either be work or full maintenance. Full maintenance must have its relationship to previous earnings and, therefore, there is every justification for our new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friends the Members for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) and Southall (Mr. Bidwell). I raised this subject in the Second Reading debate and I have raised it on previous occasions in Committee and on the Floor of the House. The problem of the long-term unemployed has affected my part of the country for the whole of my life. My constituency of Rhondda, West was called a distressed area when I was a boy. It progressed to a development district: it was advanced to a development area, and was then super-promoted to a special development area. Throughout my life it has been given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
a special designation because of the problem of high and long-lasting unemployment. The treatment of the long-term unemployed is a shame when one thinks of the vast sums of money now being spent by this nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points of shame is that the longer the unemployment, the lower the income of that family and the greater the need of that family becomes. With long unemployment the family needs to replace clothing, furnishings and all other necessities of life. It was brought home to me on Saturday morning when a man and his wife came to see me in my surgery. They were in tears because they were in arrears with their rent and their only explanation was that in order to allow their child to go on a school trip they financed it by deliberately allowing their rent to fall into arrears. Basically, it is the inadequate treatment of the long-term unemployed that put the family in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have accepted our national responsibility for the long-term sick, and I believe that we are moving—possibly too slowly—towards accepting our responsibility for the long-term disabled. But there is no evidence that we are accepting our responsibility for the long-term unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first letter sent to me when I was a Member of Parliament was from a gentleman called Mr. Parlour, who unfortunately has now left this world. It was on the very subject of the treatment of the long-term unemployed. We are treating the long-term unemployed in 1972 in a far less generous and less fair fashion than we treated them in 1948. In 1948, under the Jim Griffiths Act of 1946, unemployment benefit could be extended for as long as the period of unemployment lasted. The sole test was that a person was fit, willing and able to work, and the sole judge was a local tribunal set up under Section 62 of that Act. The tribunal was asked only to judge whether the claimant was fit, willing and able to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be said that such an extension of benefit for long-term unemployed is an over-weighty burden on the national insurance fund, but the provisions of Section 62, which dealt with long-term unemployed, were financed not out of the national insurance fund but out of money provided by Parliament. It has been done partly in the past, and there is no reason why it could not be done today. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
State should accept responsibility either to provide full employment or to support the long-term unemployed. We know the present position. After six months earnings-related benefit disappears and after 12 months unemployment benefit stops. The tragedy is that until they become victims of it, few people are aware that unemployment benefit ceases after 312 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1948 Act partly accepted the philosophy of the Beveridge Report, to the extent that it was prepared by using Section 62 to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed as long as those needs needs lasted. We have now gone far from that, as those who represent areas of high and long-lasting unemployment can testify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 62 was removed after the five-year period by the Conservative Government in 1953. No hon. Member opposite can say differently. The extra protection that Section 62 gave to the long-term unemployed was deliberately taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support new Clause 3, although I do not regard it as ideal. I support it because of what my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) said in 1946 in the Committee dealing with the National Insurance Bill. During the debate on 7th March, 1946, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I regard the restriction of benefit for the unemployed as one of the gravest effects of this Bill."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee A</i>, 7th March, 1946; 
	<i>c</i>. 140.]</p></blockquote>
and went on to advocate the points of Section 62 as being better than nothing but not sufficient to deal permanently with the long-term unemployed. My right hon. Friend then drew attention to the fact that when we moved away from the Beveridge concept of meeting need as long as need lasted in unemployment, we were getting into serious difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some alleviation of the problems of the long-term unemployed is essential. The provisions of new Clause 3—inadequate as I believe them to be—are the least that we have a right to expect from the Government at the present moment. It is true, thankfully, that the present national unemployment figures have fallen, but we cannot be content with likely future trends. I quote the present Leader of the House when Minister of Employment—that is a good joke: "Minister of Employment"—on 4th March, when he said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"unemployment is unlikely to drop below the half-million mark for two years or more."</p></blockquote>
If that is true we should make extra provision for that figure, because a large proportion of it will be composed of those who will have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit and who certainly will have exhausted their right to earnings-related benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest published figures of the duration of unemployment were for January, 1972. They show that in Great Britain 779,791 males were unemployed at that time; 15½ per cent.—122,000—had been unemployed for over six months and had therefore lost their earnings-related benefit; 16½ per cent.—an additional 130,000—had been unemployed for over 12 months. Fortunately, the figures for women are better; only 11 per cent. have been unemployed for over six months and 8½ per cent. for over 12 months. That is related to the fact that large numbers of women do not register under any circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures of 15½ per cent. men unemployed for more than six months and 16½ per cent. unemployed for more than 12 months indicate the national aspect of the problem, but there are tremendous regional differences. As long as there is this unfair treatment, region by region, no one should suggest, as the Prime Minister has often done, that the Government are concerned with the creation of one nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest figures from the DEP Gazette of February, 1972, show the following percentages for those who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, that is, those who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, that is, those who have lost their entitlement to unemployment benefit: in London and the South-East, 10 per cent.; in the South-East as a whole, 11 per cent.; in Wales, 19½ per cent.; in Scotland, 20 per cent.; and in the North of England, 23 per cent. While we may take some comfort from the national average of 16½ per cent. of our unemployed being unemployed for
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
over 12 months, in many regions nearly a quarter of those who are unemployed have been unemployed for more than 12 months. In the development areas at least one in five and nearly one in four have been unemployed for 12 months and have then lost their entitlement to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is what happens to these men. We get the comforting answer that they can always go along to the Supplementary Benefits Commission with a claim. Apart from the distaste for means-tested benefits felt by men who have been used to work and who want to work to maintain their families, facts and figures are available that of those who apply for means-tested supplementary benefits only 76 per cent. of those who have lost their entitlement to unemployment benefit receive anything. Twenty-four per cent.—one quarter—receive nothing. The State has completely abandoned its responsibility for this 24 per cent. of those who have been unemployed for more than 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of people are we talking about? We are not talking about scroungers. We are talking about people who have lost their job, often as a result of deliberate Government policy. Pit closures have had a tremendous effect in my area. That problem has largely disappeared because we have no collieries left. In my area, of those who have lost their entitlement to unemployment benefit, 24 per cent. are over 60, 34 per cent. are between 50 and 60, 22 per cent. are between 40 and 50, 10 per cent. are between 30 and 40 and 10 per cent. are under 30. This clearly indicates that it is the older age groups—those people who have made the greatest contribution to the wealth of the country—which suffer most from long-term unemployment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
