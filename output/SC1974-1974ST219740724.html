	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT AGRICULTURAL LIME SCHEME (EXTENSION OF PERIOD) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Draft Agricultural Lime Scheme (Extension of Period) Order 1974.</p></blockquote>
I think the Committee will welcome this extension of the scheme, and I do not think there is any need to go into it too deeply. The purpose of the order is to continue for a further five years, from the end of this month, the authority to make payments to farmers in the United Kingdom towards the cost of liming agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, liming is a vital farming operation. We believe that this subsidy is an investment in the structure of the soil, as without adequate liming the soil would be impoverished and our national resources depleted. Farmers know the value of liming, but a lime subsidy has played an important part in farming policy since 1937. We propose, therefore, to continue the lime subsidy in its present form at an estimated annual cost to the Exchequer of £5 million. I therefore invite the Committee to approve the draft order accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.32 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak only briefly on this order. The Committee will recollect that this scheme was terminated, or notice was given that it was to be terminated, some time ago. I think the reason that announcement was made by the previous Government was that it was held at that time that the scheme was in contravention of the terms of our accession to the European Economic Community. As I read the Treaty of Rome, it seems to me that a lime scheme is in flagrant violation of Article
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
92 of the Treaty of Rome. But I understand perfectly well that the way in which the treaty is dealt with in Brussels and the attitude of the Commission to countries such as ours which find themselves in difficulties is one of benevolence and a certain degree of flexibility. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that, on the face of it, this type of scheme is in contravention of Article 92 of the treaty, which does not allow State aids which distort competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the use of lime and its advantages in agricultural practice, I agree with what the Minister said in his opening remarks, but I remember that when I was a student at university my professor of agriculture used to trot out an old farming adage:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lime and lime and no manure</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Makes both farm and farmer poor"</p></blockquote>
The truth is that at the turn of the century, before modern agricultural science took on its present sophisticated and advanced knowledge, there were many farmers who put lime on their fields year after year, but did not put on much manure, and the fertility of the soil rapidly decreased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to ask the Minister whether it is now accepted by the Commission and the people in Brussels who look after such things that a lime subsidy is legal. Is it not true that a fertiliser subsidy could be brought back? If it is possible to introduce a lime subsidy, is there any technical objection to bringing back a fertiliser subsidy as well? That is a fair question, and I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the two questions asked by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), I think I can say that the subsidy will be considered in the usual way by the EEC Commission in its programme of harmonising State aids to agriculture. Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty of Rome prohibit any aid which distorts, or threatens to distort, competition in trade between Member States, and the hon. Gentleman has rightly referred to that. The provisions require Member States to notify the Commission of plans to grant or alter State aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lime subsidy will come up for review in the Commission's programme. I cannot anticipate what the result may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
be but, as the hon. Gentleman says, there is enormous advantage in liming. The application of lime has been running at about 4½ million tons a year, which is the level estimated to be sufficient to maintain the existing situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the comparison between fertilisers and lime, the hon. Gentleman may recall from his college days that lack of lime can increase the acidity of the soil and result in a loss of fertility and a reduction in crops. This is, therefore, a long-term investment in soil. I am not sure of the Commission's attitude in this matter. It may say that fertilisers give a seasonal or annual boost to crops and this may distort competition between the Member States, but it may well take the view that lime is long-term investment in a different category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to attempt to blind the Minister with science, but some people might argue that the premise on which he is now working is contentious. Liming has to be a regular practice. The level of acidity in most land tends to rise over the years unless it is corrected by regular applications of lime. On my own farm, we apply lime every four or five years, right round the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could say the same thing about fertilisers. I quote as an example potassium, the level of which tends to drop over the years and has to be boosted regularly. Potassium is not leached out of the soil. It tends to stay there and be removed only by crops. It does not tend to be lost in the same way as nitrogen, about which the Minister is perhaps thinking. Therefore I think that it is valid to refer to the similarity between lime and fertilisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for that short technical dissertation. Some of his points will, of course, be borne in mind by the Commission, but the fact is that liming affects the range of crops that will be grown in the next four or five years. Liming is a longterm investment in the soil structure, compared with fertilisers, which have a shorter period of effectiveness. These are matters for the Commission. The United Kingdom has operated the lime scheme and subsidies since 1937, and we would have a strong case before the Commission for its continuation. I appreciate the welcome which the hon. Member has given
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to the continuation of the scheme, and we think that it will be welcomed by the farming community generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Draft Agricultural Lime Scheme (Extension of Period) Order 1974.</p></blockquote></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>HOP GARDENS (REPLANTING AND RESTRUCTURING) SCHEME 1974</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I have always understood that an affirmative order could not come into force until it was agreed by the House. Would you be good enough to explain why this scheme says on page 1 that it came into operation yesterday? It would be helpful if you could clarify the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Technically, that is not a point of order. If the hon. Member would be kind enough to look at the wording at the top of the scheme he will see that it has to be approved
	<br><blockquote><p>"within 40 days beginning with the day on which the scheme was made ".</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Member then looks at the dates, he will see that the scheme was made on 20th June. Therefore, the Minister has 40 days from that date in which to get the scheme approved. The scheme is shown as coming into operation yesterday, but the relevant fact is that we are debating it within 40 days of its being made. I should not wish to rule on this officially as Chairman, because I do not think that it is a matter for the Chair, but I think that what I have said is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Hop Gardens (Replanting and Restructuring) Scheme 1974.</p></blockquote>
I think that the Committee and agriculture as a whole will welcome the scheme. It is made under Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970, and enables grants of up to £280 an acre to be paid to growers for replanting their hop gardens with improved varieties of hops, for renewing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the structures on which the hops are grown or for a combination of these operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme will help growers to adapt their production to varieties with a high content of bittering acids, which are being increasingly demanded by brewers and the public and to improve the structures on which they are grown. It will provide assistance for our own hop growers similar to that already available in the other hop-producing countries of the Community. There are, however, certain differences. EECRegulation No. 1696 of 1971, which provides for the grants to be made, permits them to be paid only to recognised producer groups. We have the Hops Marketing Board, as Members know, whose valuable contribution to the well-being of the industry is acknowledged, but we do not have producer groups as defined by the regulation. It was therefore necessary, as I am sure the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) will appreciate, for us to seek a derogation from the strict provisions of the regulation so as to pay these grants to individual producers rather than to groups, and this we have succeeded in doing, though it took quite a bit of negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although our own hop growers have an advantage in that they can be considered individually for grant aid, they are at a slight disadvantage in that the provision of the Act of Accession under which we secured the derogation limits it to the period to 31st January 1975. The regulation itself permits payment of these grants until 31st December 1975. Because of the unavoidable delay in securing the derogation to which I have referred and the limited period of availability of these grants, we propose, and the scheme provides, for them to be paid on work done during the whole of the two years provided by the derogation, even though this dates from 1st February 1973. I should perhaps stress that the scheme is designed to encourage the improvement of hop gardens and not the expansion of hope production, and it contains provisions to this end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I need not remind hon. Members of the important part played by our hops in the brewing of British beer. The scheme that we are considering will help in no small measure—I think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
is an appropriate term—to maintain this predominance by helping our growers to meet the demands of the users of the hops and the consumers of the beer. This must have a popular appeal, and I hope that the Committee will accept the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Crouch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, but I have in my constituency a considerable number of hop gardens and hop producers. I have had represented to me over the last few months some of the problems facing the hop producer, and the question that I should like to ask the Minister today reflect some of the concern that has been represented to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, one must welcome this measure which will make what appears to be a generous grant to the hop producer, but has the Minister considered why it is necessary to make this grant, and why it is necessary for these so-called improved varieties to be planted to replace the existing hops?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no expert on this, and I have had to take advice on the matter, but I have discovered that the British hop farmer is finding that his variety of hops is not succeeding as well with British brewers as it used to do and that British brewers are tending to buy on the world market, particularly from West Germany and the United States. The British hop producer is finding so I am told, that because the present variety of British hops does not have this so-called high content of bittering acids he is disadvantaged in the world market. British brewers are seeking their supplies from the world market, rather than turning to the British farmer, and the complaint made to me some months ago was that they would have to replant with new varieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the tendency to buy in the world market has been increased by our joining the Common Market. Since we joined the Common Market, there has been a tendency on the part of the brewers to look to Germany and the United States and elsewhere for their hopes to satisfy a world rather than a British taste in beer. I do not wish to be facetious. This has meant a change in demand—I shall not say a levelling down—from British brewers who are trying to satisfy a unified world taste in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
beer rather than the traditional British taste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again that I am not being facetious. I am a strong advocate of Britain's membership of the Common Market, but this is one of those areas in which, by being a member of the Community we are running into difficulties for our hop farmers, in that they have to change their hops to satisfy a European and world demand, without being motivated in any way by the British beer drinker. Hop farmers, as they represented it to me, were dismayed at the cost of replanting, which was very high. They were also dismayed that their traditional big customers, the big British brewers, were tending to look elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on these matters. As I said, I do not speak with any expert knowledge; I am merely reporting what has been told to me at farmers' meetings. We are faced with having to make this grant to help the British hop producer produce a new type of hop. I should like to know whether the Minister can assure the Committee that this new type of hop is one that will be satisfactory to the British beer drinker, and what are his views and those of this Department in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know—and I hope that the Minister will be honest with the Committee—whether he thinks this is a good move, or whether it is purely a matter of international rationalisation. I confess that I should be sorry to think that the real reason for this scheme is to rationalise the type of beer and the type of hops that go into it. I know that my hop farmers will welcome this scheme, because they have been disadvantaged by the existing conditions, and they will be most interested in the Minister's observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak only briefly on this scheme. Is the Minister entirely happy about the implications of paying these grants retrospectively to growers who have begun work on or after 1st February 1973. It is the general rule of his Department that approval must be given for grants before work can begin. This is something of a departure from that rule. I cannot think of other occasions on which this has happened, but no doubt the hon. Gentleman will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
able to give other examples of retrospective grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This scheme is open to the possibility of abuse, and I must ask the Minister whether he is absolutely satisfied that there can be no question of that happening. The 1st February 1973 is now some time back, and I imagine that it would be very difficult for an inspector to go into a hop garden now and be absolutely satisfied that work had begun as far back as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one speaks about work beginning, does this include purchasing? If a farmer is about to involve himself in some of the restructuring, that is laid down in the schedule, does "work beginning" include the purchase of things such as poles, wires and all the other things specified in the schedule? I imagine that some of the items for which grants will be made might have been ordered, paid for in full or delivered before that date, but will be used in restructuring after that date. I think there is a rather grey area here of what might have happened 18 months ago, and there could be a certain amount of dissatisfaction with whether the Government were keeping their tabs carefully on expenditure of this sort. We must be very careful, in the House and in the Committee, to be sure that when we vote money for the Government to spend on such a worthy scheme as this there is no abuse of it. We must always be careful to make sure that public money is not wrongfully used, or is used in a way that this House has not approved of, and I should be most grateful if the Minister would deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer to the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) is that we are, of course, aware of the interest and concern in his area, and of the contribution that it makes to agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's comments about whether we are being persuaded by the brewers, by the EEC, or by other means, I think he will appreciate that what really matters is the choice of the consumer. It is the people who drink the beer who decide what they want, and I think that the brewers reflect public taste. The EEC is not particularly concerned in this. The brewers are demanding the higher alpha hops, and if they are not available in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
United Kingdom they have to go elsewhere to get them. The grant is to help the British growers to change to new varieties because it is true that accession to the EEC improved the access of foreign hops to the United Kingdom market. Demand for high alpha hops in part affects the long-term trend to improve beers and, as I said, I think the change is due to increasing demand for the various types of beer that people wish to drink.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister care to comment on the fact that we have joined the EEC and we now have a much bigger market for selling our farm produce to those countries—hops in this case? Is it a fact that European taste is a bigger influence than it was hitherto, and that this is having an effect on the type of hops that we should grow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is relevant. Regardless of our membership of the EEC, more British people now drink foreign lager and other foreign beers. It is a matter of the consumer's taste, and growers have had to take that into account in their demands for varieties of hops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme gives grant aid for replanting with certain varieties, and these are named as Bullion, Northern Brewer, Wye Target, Wye Northdown, Wye Challenger, and Keyworths Midseason. In order to encourage the planting of material of the highest quality, a higher rate of grant will be paid for plants bought from a propagator registered as A plus under the certification scheme operated by the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reply to the comments of the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) is that any permanent equipment used for complete rewiring or repoling will be eligible for a restructuring grant, but replacement of parts of wire work under normal maintenance procedures will not be eligible for a grant, nor will labour costs.

The hon. Member made a valid point when he questioned our policy of going back in time to cover eligibility for the grant. EEC Regulation 423 /74 provides a special derogation from the main hops regulation EEC 196/71 so that the grant may be paid in the United Kingdom to individual producers, and I have already referred to this. The derogation runs from 1st February 1973—the date on
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
which the Common Agricultural Policy became operative in the United Kingdom—for two years, which is the maximum allowed under the Treaty of Accession. The derogation was not obtained until early in 1974, and although it is not usual to make a scheme to pay grant on work which in many cases will have already begun, and in some cases finished, it is considered acceptable in this scheme, first, because it was impossible to make provisions for implementing the scheme until the Community had granted a derogation—I think that that is important—and, secondly, because it is reasonable that we should make available to our own producers, as far as EEC regulations permit, a benefit that has been enjoyed by competitors in other Community countries. In the existing circumstances, it will not be possible for a grant to be paid in the United Kingdom for work carried out after the final date specified in the derogation, that is, 31st January 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been in consultation with the Community for a long time in seeking to get a derogation, and interested hop growers will have been notified of this. I have questioned the Department on the point, and I understand that detailed information is available within it about aspects of grant aid which have appeared in the last two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation, but that was not quite my point. I asked how the Department's inspectors could be sure that the work they inspected was in fact done after the starting date of 1st February 1973. How will they know, for instance, that it was not done in the autumn of the previous year? This is something about which we must be careful, because although the regulation may say that this can be done and the Treaty of Rome may allow us to do it—I quite understand that —how are we in this House to know that the Minister's inspectors, when they look at these restructuring enterprises, can be sure that the work was done after that date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also asked what was meant by "work begun ". Does it mean from the first day that a grower starts ordering his poles and wires, and so on? Unless the Minister can answer those questions, we shall not feel happy about giving money retrospectively so far back in a way over which I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
do not believe the Government have much control. I feel slightly unhappy about it, because I should have thought it would be difficult for an inspector to know exactly when work was begun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member is right to seek this assurance. I said that it dates from the time when we came into the Community, when similar aid was provided to other member countries. We have been seeking a derogation since then, largely on the basis that the grant under EEC terms is payable to producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of our problems—we have a Hops Marketing Board, and not producers in the same sense. Hop growers have been aware of our efforts to seek a derogation over this period of negotiation, and the Department has been in close touch with them on all these matters, over the keeping of accounts and in other ways. The records of the Hops Marketing Board are being used to check activities carried out by reference to areas planted each season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry would have to be satisfied as to the eligibility for grant of those who seek it. Records would have to be produced, and other evidence possibly given, for the Ministry to be so assured. The onus is on those seeking the grants to provide the evidence to show why the Ministry would be justified in paying them. Hop growers have been aware over this period that this was coming, so there has been close liaison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot get away with that. He cannot say that the onus is on the people who are applying. If we are voting money, the onus is on the Ministry to make sure that it is not giving public money to people who are not legally entitled to receive it. I must pin the hon. Gentleman down. We must be sure that, apart from cheating and false declarations by applicants, the Ministry will be in a good position to know that it is spending money according to the law. How will it do so? Will it make inquiries locally and carry out a great many more inquiries? I know that if I want to do certain work on my own farm the inspector comes and looks at the site before it happens so that it is firmly known that the work had not begun on a certain date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
But here there is a wide open loophole, and we ought to know more. Will there be some special form of inquiry, whereby somebody will have to testify that work had not begun on a certain date? Will applicants be asked to provide some third party who will sign a testimony to say that that is so? I am speaking off-the-cuff. Those are ways in which it might be done, but I had hoped that the Minister would have a better answer and would explain the situation more fully. Quite a lot of money is involved—up to £280 an acre is a great deal—and we ought to have some better assurances than we have had so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member is right in wanting assurances and I support him in that. If he will recall my words, he will remember I said that it will be up to those who seek the grant to provide the evidence that it should be paid. It is up to them to satisfy the Ministry, and that is what the hon. Gentleman is saying. I am sure that the Ministry will want documentary evidence cross-checked by the Hops Marketing Board, and farm records certified by accountants will also be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growers were given notice that we were seeking to pay the grant from a certain date but could not pay it until the House had given approval after derogation discussions had taken place. It is in that light that they have been aware of the possibility of a grant being paid, and they have therefore been required to produce the evidence and documentation. I think I can give an assurance that no public money will be paid unless the Ministry is satisfied that it is in order under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 speaks of
	<br><blockquote><p>"Basic conditions of eligibility for a grant ",</p></blockquote>
and so on, and lays out clearly what conditions have to be met. The scheme goes into great detail, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Ministry will want all the evidence possible from accountants, documentary and otherwise, and will liaise with the Hops Marketing Board. In this way, we can be satisfied that the claim is justified. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we must have the assurances that he seeks, and I think that I can give them to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister one other question about what replanting and restructuring means. Has the Minister given thought to the fact that this will mean a contraction in the acreage devoted to hops in Britain? This is important. It will mean a change in the total production of hops because, as I understand it, the new varieties have a much higher yield in the flavour they produce—a higher content of bittering acids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been represented to me that it may mean that we shall need less acreage and less hop production because we shall have a high yield for the purpose for which hops are used. It would be helpful to know whether any estimate has yet been made in the Department of how this will affect the acreage of hops in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also ask the Minister whether he is able to advise the Committee of any estimate that his Department has of the cost of the grant in the year in which it applies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can reply to the hon. Member by saying that we expect 2,500 of our total of 16,000 acres to benefit from the scheme, at a cost of about £700,000. Only half of this cost will be met from national funds. The other half will be reimbursed by the EEC's Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the actual basis of the scheme, it was made, as I said, under Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970, enabling grants of about £280 an acre to be paid to growers for replanting their hop gardens with improved varieties of hops and for renewing structures upon which hops are grown and for a combination of these operations. It is an encouragement to plant certain strains. I have been advised that the high alpha acid hops have a higher yield. The reduction in acreage that might be required is expected to be more than made up for by the growth in beer consumption, both in the United Kingdom and throughout the world. We expect the acreage to remain steady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crouch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for this final statement, because it assures me that my hop farmers will continue to produce the same quantity
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
of hops and have a valuable market. It is still a valuable product, as he knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the generosity of the Government, now that we are members of the Common Market, in helping our farmers to meet these additional costs, but we must not lose sight of one other fact which has nothing to do with cost but concerns the content and quality of the product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still left with the feeling that, now that we are in Europe, our beer is being Europeanised, that our hop farmers will come under much greater pressure of world competition, and that brewers will be looking outside this country not only for their hops but also for hops essence. Now that we are in the Common Market, we know well enough that there is a gain and a disadvantage. There is a gain in so far as we gain an additional market for our products. The disdvantage, if it is one, is the additional competition that we have to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British hops are something with which we have grown up. They are one of our great traditions, along with Cox's Orange Pippin, the great British domestic eating apple. Now we find that the drinker of beer is concerned not so much with what goes into his beer, but what it tastes like and what satisfaction he gets from it. It has always been assumed with English ale or Scottish beer that it is something very British and very much part of our tradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was a change in British taste and that many people were drinking European lagers. They are indeed, to my dismay and disappointment. When I go into the local pub I find that I am offered something from Holland, Belgium or Germany and even the Scandinavian countries. These are interesting drinks when one travels abroad, but one of the most important things is to come back, as it were, to hearth and home and English ale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making rapid progress this morning in welcoming the help that is being given to the British hop farmer to replant and restructure, but we must ask why this is so, and the answer is that we are seeing a change that is not wished by the British people but is being brought about by the pressures of a European market. It is a European taste that is coming in. As I said earlier, it is an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
unrequired rationalisation of our taste, and I am sorry about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that I like about the Common Market is not that we should all be the same, but that we should retain our distinct differences, our particular likes and prejudices, and so maintain our interest for each country. When we visit other countries, whether in the community of nations or not, we find that there are some things that we like. In Italy it may be Italian wine, and in France it may be French brandy. I certainly never want to drink French beer. I should probably drink German or Danish beer if I went to France, but never French beer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether, in future when I go back to my constituency, I shall find a slight French flavour coming over the channel into British beer because Allied Breweries or Bass Charrington are finding that the hops they are producing or buying from the Hops Marketing Board, probably grown in my constituency, have a new acid in them—what the Minister called a bittering acid. If it is the sort of sweet flavour, not so bitter, that one finds in French beer, I shall be dismayed, and I shall continue to raise the matter in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being facetious. I am echoing a feeling that is felt in the country. It is a serious subject, and it has been represented in the country before. The change is about to be made, the money is about to be granted and the farmer will say: "Oh well, so be it. This is what we have to produce. The Government are helping us, we think generously ". I acknowledge that, but I am concerned that the changes are being brought about by rationalisation, by the Europeanisation of our tastes. Would the Minister care to comment on that? Does he feel that we shall still retain our
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
distinct qualities, notwithstanding the replanting and restructuring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I need to say much, because I agree with the hon. Member, that, basically, it is a matter not merely of specific gravity but of taste. The consumer has a wider choice now when he travels abroad and tastes other beers, and the taste may be continued over here on his return. I believe that British beer is still superb and much to be preferred to many foreign lagers, but there is a public taste for some of the European beers and lagers, and brewers have to acknowledge and reflect that. The Ministry is helping hop growers in to provide what the brewers and the public want. The hon. Member may be assured to some extent by the knowledge that imported beer represents less than 0.1 per cent. of all beer drunk in this country. I am surprised at that figure; it is much lower than I thought it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say one final word to the hon. Member for Westmorland about his rightful queries on the payment of the grant from 1973. I think the hon. Gentleman is basically satisfied, but I assure him that the Hops Marketing Board handles all hops grown in the United Kingdom for sale. Marketing through the board is compulsory, and I think that that will help us to be able to certify some of the claims that may be made. I throw that in as an extra assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
