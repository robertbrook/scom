	<p>
	<i>Amendment proposed [8 December]:</i> No. 100, in page 6, line 12, leave out subsections (5) and (6).—
	<i>[Mr. Tony Lloyd.]</i></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 151, in page 6, line 12, leave out subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Can you clarify the position on the sittings of the Committee because there is a strange rumour circulating in the House? We cannot believe that it is true because it suggests that the proceedings of the Committee are to be guillotined almost immediately and that the guillotine motion will be debated on the Floor of the House next Tuesday. It is difficult to believe that rumour, given that the Committee has sat for so few hours and has made significant progress. 
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> Conservative Members laugh at that. Only the other day, the Under-Secretary of State for Schools told us how time flies when one is having a good time. I am surprised that they do not think that the Committee has made swift progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter. The rumour is unbelievable given the Government's claim about the importance of the Bill. If this Bill is to set the scene for education for the next 20 years, surely we should have sufficient time to debate all the clauses. I wonder about the timing of this decision—if it has been decided—because we are about to discuss the clauses dealing with grant-maintained schools. Perhaps the Government are frightened of talking about the failure of their push to get schools into the grant-maintained sector and the anomalies and difficulties that have arisen as a result of their policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir John, can you give the Committee your guidance and tell us whether you have heard any suggestion of a guillotine motion? What can you do to protect the Committee's ability to deal with the important parts of the Bill that still need much discussion? Conservative Members have been remarkably silent during the passage of the Bill so far, but Opposition Members believe that it has serious consequences for education and requires proper and full scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot help the hon. Lady on this matter. We shall have to await the business statement in the House this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I hope that you will bear in mind that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
spent our entire first sitting discussing the sittings motion. That was a wasted day and prevented us reaching the very clauses to which the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) referred. It is not Conservative Members who have prevented the Committee from reaching those clauses, but the time wasting and filibustering of Opposition Members. I hope that we can now get on with discussing those clauses, because that is what Conservative Members are here for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I should like your advice on the point made by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). He suggested that our first sitting was a filibuster, that we were out of order and that you were wrong not to pull us up earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not read into the remarks of the hon. Member for Battersea any reflection on the Chair. These matters must await another debate on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I am genuinely seeking your guidance on the procedure, because the Minister is on record as saying that, as this is an important matter, we can take as long as we want. I seek your specific guidance on the following question: is there any precedent for a Committee sitting on the day the House rises, which in this case will be next Thursday, 17 December? Would that be in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that it would be in order for the Committee to sit on that day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I seek your guidance as to the normal procedure regarding the maximum number of hours for which a Committee may sit. I have calculated that at the present rate of six hours per clause, we would need something like two years to consider the Bill's 250 clauses. Is there any precedent for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for any guillotine debate that the Committee may have in the future. It is not a matter for me this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. As a relatively new Member of the House of Commons I am unfamiliar with Committee procedure. I thought that the Committee stage involved detailed scrutiny of the Bill. Is there a precedent for applying a guillotine when the Committee has only reached clause 10?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. There are, of course, ample precedents for guillotines, but that is a matter for a debate that may take place at some date in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education (Mr. Nigel Forman)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned at 11.45 pm last Tuesday, I was just beginning my innings and getting a sight of the ball, as batsmen say, I assure the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd), to whom I was addressing some of my remarks, that I shall take amendments Nos. 100 and 151 seriously. They have been tabled in a genuine spirit of inquiry and it is right that the Government should make a satisfactory response. I intend also to answer the points raised by the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright), who has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
kindly informed me that he will join the Committee a little later this morning. I shall therefore reserve my comments on the matters that that hon. Gentleman raised until he is able to be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would remove any arrangements for the appointment, resignation and reappointment of members of the grant-maintained committee on an agreed syllabus conference. I am surprised that Opposition Members have tabled the amendments. The subsections that they would remove merely follow the arrangements under schedule 5 of the Education Act 1944 with respect to the other four existing committees of the agreed syllabus conference. I am sure that Opposition Members will realise that it is necessary to have a mechanism for dealing with appointments to and resignations and withdrawals from such committees. The arrangements in clause 10(5) and 10(6) are the most sensible way in which to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that the agreed syllabus conference determines the syllabus in a locality for the vital subject or religious education, which is an important part of the curriculum. Clause 10 provides that grant-maintained schools should be involved in that process and that a separate committee should reflect their distinctive contribution. It is clear that such schools will have an increasingly distinctive point of view as they grow and their number increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(5) requires the LEA, when convening a conference, to ensure that the representatives appointed to the new fifth committee, the grant-maintained committee, are acceptable to a majority of relevant grant-maintained schools. That means that an LEA must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the committee is representative. It should consult the Church of England, other denominations and teacher association committees. The procedure is on all fours with that of the other committees. It is strange that the Opposition propose procedural differences between committees. The components committees of the agreed syllabus conference are supposed to work uniformly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(5) provides a safeguard for the LEA. Once the LEA has taken reasonable steps, the proceedings of the agreed syllabus conference cannot be invalidated on the grounds that the grant-maintained committee is unrepresentative. The hon. Member for Stretford mentioned that on Tuesday. If a grant-maintained school is unwilling to agree representation, the vital work of the conference will continue. An individual grant-maintained school could not veto the conference's work. The LEA will be responsible for convening the conferences. I am surprised that the Opposition have tabled an amendment that would weaken the LEA's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10(6) provides for circumstances in which members of a grant-maintained committee resign or withdraw or require the LEA to make a fresh appointment to fill a vacancy. There is no difficulty with the provision, which is drawn from and inspired by schedule 5 of the 1944 Act. It is slightly different, because it makes clear that reappointments should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedures described in subsections (5) and (6) are reasonable and in the spirit of the 1944 Act. They reflect the importance that the Government attach to religious education and should command the sympathetic support
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
of the Committee. I hope that the hon. Member for Stretford will withdraw the amendment or, if he presses it to a vote, that the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can wrap up the debate briefly. The amendments were tabled to give the Minister an opportunity to explain the Government's thinking. I am grateful for the Minister's clear statement, which is now on record. I accept the Minister's assurance that the position of the grant-maintained sector will be the same as that of other bodies represented on the conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are mystified by one point. Grant-maintained schools can accept LEA arrangements, or they can choose an agreed syllabus from another LEA. That option is not open to other schools. The position of opt-out schools is, therefore, different from that of LEA schools. However, this Minister is more likely than his colleague to seek a consensus and to take the Committee into his confidence and we welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will table the guillotine motion because they fear that the Minister will have the support of both sides of the Committee and the Bill will thus be greatly improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that I tabled an amendment that was not selected, which proposed to delete the reference to clause 7(1)(b) in line 33, page 5. It was intended to tease out more about how grant-maintained schools—in the main, they will use the agreed syllabus of their local authority area—will be consulted on any changes in that agreed syllabus. Clause 130 makes it mandatory that they are consulted by the LEA and by the standing conference on any changes in the agreed syllabus. I am anxious that that agreed syllabus conference will have a committee representing grant-maintained schools only when the 75 per cent. trigger is reduced. What would happen if only 70 per cent. of the schools in an area were grant-maintained? The issue may be of great importance to all those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A fundamental difference is that an opted-out school has the opportunity to choose any agreed syllabus, from anywhere in the country. That puts grant-maintained schools in a different position from the residual 25 per cent. of schools when the full, opt-out funding agency comes into being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but most schools will at least take an interest in their agreed local syllabus. I do not argue that there should be a separate committee for grant-maintained schools at the conference when the 10 per cent. trigger point is reached because that would give them a disproportionate influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed to give the grant-maintained schools a non-voting place on the standing advisory councils on religious education in schools. That would allow them to make personal representations, rather than merely being consulted. Will the Minister consider a similar proposal for the agreed syllabus conference? For example, after the 10 per cent. trigger has been reached grant-maintained schools could be given a place on the agreed syllabus conference, on a voting or non-voting basis, so that they could make their voices heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
Will the Minister say what the "reasonable steps" in subsection (5) will be? Many people have asked me to what extent grant-maintained schools will control their representatives to the committee set up to revise the agreed syllabus when the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached? I hope that "reasonable steps" will mean that grant-maintained schools, like Church schools at present, will propose people who will automatically be put forward by the LEA. That would be better than the LEA trying to devine what nominations might be acceptable to individual grant-maintained schools. It is important that grant-maintained schools, like Church schools, have some control over the names that are likely to go forward to the LEA for nomination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised some interesting points, which he was good enough to draw to my attention earlier. I pay tribute to him for his continuing interest in these matters. He tabled some amendments that were not selected but were relevant to our consideration of clause 10, so I am happy to respond to his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools are being offered this freedom because we believe that they should be given maximum autonomy on curriculum matters and the religious dimension is an important part of the curriculum. If 75 per cent. of pupils are at grant-maintained schools, those schools should have their own committee or an agreed syllabus conference. As the hon. Member for Stretford knows, each committee has one vote on those conferences to ensure that its point of view is adequately represented. That autonomy should also be available when grant-maintained schools are uncomfortable or unhappy with the agreed syllabus in their area. They should have the option of choosing another syllabus from another area if they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proposal is in line with the Government's view that there should be as much curricula freedom as possible for grant-maintained schools and their governing bodies. That is the essence of the Government's approach to grant maintenance. We want grant-maintained schools to have maximum freedom of procedure and practice. I do not accept that they are being put in a privileged position; it is a recognition of their autonomy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, an opt-out school, like any other school in the public sector, has to follow the national curriculum. The Government want to give maximum freedom, but curricula freedom is well-defined. It is worrying that the Minister wants opt-out schools to have greater freedom than schools that are still under the LEA. Why should they not have the same freedom? Why should this greater curricula freedom be given to one type of school and not to another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The straightforward answer is that those schools which, by ballot, choose to remain in the LEA sector do so for a number of reasons, of which the curriculum may be one. It is reasonable to assume that those schools are satisfied with the approach of the LEA. It is right and proper that their views should be reflected in the lcoal authority committee on an agreed syllabus conference. There is no need for them to have an additional freedom or autonomy because they have shown no desire to have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments about religious education and the national curriculum are typical of the arguments about the Bill as a whole, but the argument for a different
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
educational freedom is worrying because it has not previously been made. Obviously, there will be different management and financial freedoms, but I am slightly worried at the proposition that LEA schools will be penned in more than grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that grant-maintained schools may choose explicitly to remain within the LEA curriculum, but has any ballot been held on that question? The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) has said that opted-out schools generally want to remain within the local authority structure, but I do not understand why the same freedom cannot be given to both types of schools. Schools will not be unhinged from any curriculum, as the curricula that are available have been adopted by other LEAs in the framework. Extending to local authority schools the same privilege that has been proposed for grant-maintained schools would not pitch them into anarchy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point but he should think it through carefully. Assuming that the Bill is enacted as drafted in this respect, every agreed syllabus conference will have a fifth committee representing grant-maintained schools. The existence of that committee will give those schools a greater sense of ownership of the religious curriculum. At present, they have a lesser relationship with and influence upon such conferences. The number of occasions on which it is likely that a grant-maintained school would exercise its extra freedom to choose another area's curriculum will be very low. I do not anticipate that it will happen often, simply because such schools will have the satisfaction of knowing that they are genuinely and fully represented at the agreed syllabus conference for the area by the new, fifth, grant-maintained committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest also tabled an amendment, which admittedly has not been selected for debate. The Government have the autonomy of grant-maintained schools very much in mind. More than anything else, the autonomous characteristic is what sets apart such schools and their governing bodies from other schools in the maintained sector. There is no disagreement about the fact that grant-maintained schools should have separate representation on the local bodies which advise and decide on religious education. I emphasise that principle to my hon. Friend. Grant-maintained schools, once the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached, will be sufficiently numerous to justify their own committee, either as part of a standing advisory council on religious education—SACRE—or of an agreed syllabus conference. To introduce that additional committee when only 10 per cent. of an areas pupils go to primary or secondary grant-maintained schools would give disproportionate weight to their views. The hon. Member for Stretford shoud understand that we want to recognise fully the autonomous characteristic of grant-maintained schools in this important aspect of the curriculum, but their views should not be given disproportionate weight. A sensible compromise is to make the arrangements applicable once the 75 per cent. trigger point has been reached, rather than at the 10 per cent. level proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that to give grant-maintained schools a separate committee at the 10 per cent. level would give them disproportionate influence. However, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
bear in mind that the arrangements for representation of grant-maintained schools on the standing conference and SACRE differ at present. Clause 130 provides that for the standing conference, such schools should be consulted before the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached. However, at present grant-maintained schools have a non-voting place on the SACRE. Would it not be more consistent if grant-maintained schools—either now or when they have reached the 10 per cent. trigger point—were to be given a place, voting or non-voting, on the conference that is studying the agreed syllabus?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall help my hon. Friend further as I am in a helpful spirit this morning—the additional information may help him to feel reassured about the way in which we propose to proceed. Before the 75 per cent. figure is reached, we want the grant-maintained schools to have some say in the agreed syllabus to be used in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose in the Bill that agreed syllabus conferences must consult the individual governing bodies of grant-maintained schools whenever they reconsider their agreed syllabuses, before the 75 per cent. figure is reached. The point underlying clause 130 is that when the conferences reconsider their agreed syllabuses, we want them to consult the grant-maintained schools.

Grant-maintained schools will also have a valuable contribution to make to advise on religious education and collective worship. As my hon. Friend said, that is why the law already allows them to be represented on the standing advisory committees on religious education before the 75 per cent. trigger point is reached, in section 11(3)(d) of the Education Reform Act 1988, which will be amended by clause 131. We shall return to that point later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth noting that there are three mathematicians on the Opposition Benches in the Committee.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that offer—I shall bear it in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to say to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) that the freedom for grant-maintained schools to do their own thing and take their own view on particular matters does not extend to other aspects of the curriculum; they are bound by the trust and approach of the national curriculum. It is not a matter of grant-maintained schools being able to opt-out or to pick and choose from the national curriculum. It is more a matter of wanting to ensure that their influence
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
over such an important dimension as religious education and collective worship—both of which are involved in the current debate—should be maximised to the greatest extent. We believe that we must give them the extra possibility of choosing another syllabus if they are dissatisfied with the previously agreed syllabus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Stretford, I anticipate that when the Bill works as intended, under the subsections, the number of occasions in which an individual grant-maintained school will opt-out of the local religious curriculum will be tiny—it probably might not occur at all because at that stage, they would be fully involved with the consultative arrangement, and would therefore have their say and their vote, which would be equal in weight to the vote of each of the other committees on the agreements of the conference. In the real world, rather than in the world of theory, I feel that the problem about which the hon. Member for Devonport is concerned, is unlikely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest would wish grant-maintained schools to be represented as soon as possible. He will acknowledge that it is convenient to use one of the trigger points in clause 7. We have outlined appropriate arrangements for grant-maintained schools to be represented before the 75 per cent. trigger point is reached. However, the effective trigger should be the phase 3 figure of 75 per cent. I hope that I have satisfied my hon. Friend that he should not be unhappy about the arrangements. It is clear from my exchanges with the Opposition that grant-maintained schools are already in a strong position. It would not be right to tilt the balance further in favour of grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall summarise the Government's position on clause 10. Clause 10 provides for proper representation of the governors of grant-maintained schools on agreed syllabus conferences. It puts into effect the intention of chapter 8 in the White Paper to ensure that the distinctive nature of the grant-maintained sector is fully recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, agreed syllabus conferences consist of four committees that represent the Church of England, other denominations and faiths, the LEA, and teachers. No provision currently exists for grant-maintained schools to be represented per se, although they are consulted by the conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that clause 10 refers to Wales as well as England. The Church was disestablished in Wales in 1921. There will, therefore, be three committees in Wales. The Church in Wales is represented on the committee for Christian denominations and other faiths.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The position in Wales is different. If I remember Welsh history correctly, there were fierce debates in Wales at the turn of the century, which were resolved by the disestablishment of the Church.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman acknowledged the confidence that the Government had shown in the ability of LEAs to convene agreed syllabus conferences. LEAs should continue to have that responsibility. The arrangements have worked well for several years and there is no reason to change them. The hon. Gentleman said that it was desirable for standing advisory committees to meet in public. That is more relevant to clause 11. I shall deal with that point when we discuss that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed his anxiety that not all denominations were adequately represented on agreed syllabus conferences. He mentioned Pentecostalists and emphasised the importance of consulting the Muslim community. It is important that all faiths should be represented on the committee of other denominations and faiths. It must be a matter for leading faiths in local communities to work out among themselves how the balance of that representation should be conducted within the committee. Each committee is likely to have between three and eight members. Within that framework, it should be possible to ensure that all the leading faiths in a given locality have adequate representation on the other faiths committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's response to the important point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth. My constituency contains a large Muslim population, which has expressed concern about the Bill's impact on religious education in the schools that Muslim children attend. However, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a problem. The Trafford area of Manchester has, for the most part, a stable community that has not experienced high levels of immigration. It is unlikely that Muslims would be strongly represented, but it is clear that such representation must exist. I realise that I can approach my LEA about that matter, but will the Minister undertake to monitor the situation to make sure that adequate representation is secured, especially for the relatively new religious minorities? Often, such people have a strong faith. We have an obligation to protect their rights as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. The spectrum of other faiths varies considerably throughout the country. However, any responsible local authority would tackle this problem and I am not sure that it is necessary for me to make such a commitment on the Government's behalf. The final decision about which faiths should be represented is the LEAs, as wise advice now tells me. Fortunately, that is in line with what I told the hon. Member for Stretford. However, it is important to realise that the LEA must take account of the traditions represented in the area. That does not mean that it has to be proportionate, nor that central Government should monitor the situation. I am relieved to learn that my natural ministerial instinct is borne out by the weight of official advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemsworth also said on Tuesday night that he thought that the funding agency should have some knowledge and, by implication, involvement in this matter. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that the Government do not intend that the funding agency should have any curricular responsibility. Religious education is an important part of the curriculum, so it would not be appropriate for me to suggest that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
funding agency should have any involvement. Clearly, it will be aware of what is happening, but we do not expect it to play any role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reply. I am trying to establish the exact boundaries of the funding agency's work. The Minister's negative answer gives a clearer definition of its responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. With any luck, we have clarified that matter. On Tuesday, the hon. Member for Hemsworth also applauded the prospective participation of grant-maintained schools in the arrangements for agreed syllabus conferences. However, he had reservations about their being able to opt out—in other words to have the ability to choose another syllabus. I had already replied to the hon. Member for Stretford who made that point so eloquently before the hon. Gentleman arrived in the Committee. I gently suggest that the hon. Gentleman read my reply in 
	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider the conferences to be important bodies, convened from time to time to review locally agreed syllabuses for religious education and, if necessary, to draw up a new syllabus. I do not understand why Opposition Members have difficulty in agreeing that the governors of grant-maintained schools should be represented on such an important body. They comprise a significant proportion of the pupils being taught in the area when the 75 per cent. trigger is reached. On reflection, most Opposition Members will accept that once the trigger is reached—it is a significant proportion of grant maintenance in an area—it makes sense, if only on the grounds of natural justice, that a committee should represent and reflect that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that at such schools, the governors have completed responsibility for the curriculum offered to the school rather than sharing that responsibility with the local education authority. One of the major responsibilities of the governing bodies is for religious education, yet were it not for clause 10, they would have little effective say in the locally agreed syllabus. That is why they should be represented at the conferences and agree a new syllabus before it can be introduced. In effect they will be given the power of veto in the same way as each of the other five committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task of an agreed syllabus conference is to ensure that the syllabus is appropriate for the local area, within the framework of the Education Reform Act 1988. It cannot be right to deny grant-maintained schools a say in that decision after the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members argued that since it is proposed that grant-maintained schools will be able to choose an alternative syllabus, they should not have a separate committee. They believe that it should be either/or—either they should have the right to choose an alternative syllabus or they should have a separate committee. I shall explain briefly why there is no such conflict. Clause 126 will give grant-maintained schools the right to choose an alternative syllabus that better meets their needs. That provision will apply before the 75 per cent. trigger is reached, before they are represented at the conference. Schools that do not have a voice at conferences should have that flexibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest will be happy to hear that. There should be no compulsion on a school that has already chosen an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
alternative syllabus with which it is content, to change its syllabus back again once the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate some of the Minister's logic, but an alternative before the 75 per cent. trigger is reached would be for the grant-maintained schools in a local authority area to be represented at the standing conference. That would allow them an input into any new syllabus; they would be part of the process and therefore happy with the agreed syllabus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Into which committee does the hon. Gentleman suggest they have an input?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are already represented on the standing advisory conference. The issue could therefore be devolved to the committee that deals with the new syllabus. Would there be an insurmoutable difficulty if that happened at an earlier stage than the 75 per cent. trigger point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Currently, grant-maintained schools have a limited influence, but governing bodies cannot expect to have a committee of their own and the power of veto that they would have in phase. 3. Whether they have formal procedures that reflect their importance and preponderance in an area is a matter of judgment. No one would argue that they should not have a formal committee of their own at the 75 per cent. stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 7 of the Education Reform Act 1988 requires collective worship in schools to be "wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character." The standing advisory councils can exempt individual schools from that requirement. Such exemptions have been granted, and in some cases they have been refused. What will be the remit of grant-maintained schools? The LEA has a duty to decide whether a school is complying with the law. The major reason for refusing to grant an exemption is that the syllabus is inconsistent with present law. There must be a mechanism to determine whether the syllabus proposed by an opt-out school is consistent with the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An opt-out school will be entitled to use a syllabus of another LEA, so the problem may not arise, but it might want to exercise its right to be exempted. How would that work in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to look into that matter further. I do not have a ready answer for the hon. Gentleman now. He should consider clause 122, which is relevant because it enables grant-maintained schools to apply to the standing advisory council on religious education for a determination that the requirement for collective worship to be of a broadly Christian character be lifted. Clause 122 would meet the hon. Gentleman's point, and he should await the discussions on clause 122 for the matter to be elaborated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained why we believe that it is right for grant-maintained schools as a group to be involved in the agreed syllabus conference after the 75 per cent. threshold has been reached. I also recognise that every grant-maintained school is an autonomous institution: I made great play of that point earlier. It would not be right to bind individual schools to the decisions of the grant-maintained group if their governors, for good reasons, wished to exercise their autonomy and choose a syllabus that better meets their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
Let me be clear. I would prefer grant-maintained schools to use the locally agreed syllabus if that is appropriate. That chimes with the point that I made to the hon. Member for Hemsworth. I expect that once they are confident of having adequate representation and an ability to influence decisions on the local syllabus, they will be most unlikely, to want to opt out and choose a different syllabus. The vast majority will probably conform to the arrangements proposed in the Bill. They are more likely willingly to conform if they are fully involved in the decisions on that syllabus. However, we do not want to constrain them needlessly, so we have to strike a sensible balance. We want them to be involved in the arrangements, but if they are deeply unhappy with the local syllabus they should be able to choose a syllabus from another area in line with their curricular freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 is consistent with part I. It would ensure appropriate administrative arrangements for the grant-maintained sector as it expands. The purpose of the Bill is to provide appropriate administrative structures for the growing grant-maintained sector. The structures cannot be left as they are as that sector grows and transforms education in different places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I shall comment briefly on the points raised during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister established that the extra-curricular freedom of the grant-maintained sector will apply only to religious education. To extend that freedom to other subjects would be a radical departure from the Government's intentions in the national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A grant-maintained school can accept the LEA syllabus for religious education, individual parents can withdraw their children from religious education lessons, and schools can apply for exemption from the LEA syllabus. The right to do that is important. It is necessary to protect minorities and to allow for dissent within the system, in the past few days the problems that religious intolerance can cause have been emphasised on a world scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It worries me that grant-maintained schools will be put on a different footing from LEA schools. A LEA school will be able to apply to the standing advisory committees for total exemption from the syllabus. Ironically, the schools could adopt a syllabus from another LEA. it could also devise its own syllabus. However, the LEA will decide whether to allow the school to opt out of the syllabus. An opt-out school has more freedom. I do not understand the reasons for that. No school has opted out of LEA control for religious reasons. It is conceivable that a school that has a high proportion of Muslims or children of any other religion, whose parents feel that the LEA does not define their views acceptably, will opt out. However, I would be worried if religion was used as a main reason for opting out. No Minister or supporter of the Bill has expressed that intention. It takes us into unchartered territory. I hope that the Minister will keep an open mind about denying the same freedom to LEA schools and about allowing them the opportunity to opt for a different LEA syllabus. That freedom would put all schools on the same footing. All hon. Members agree that this is an important matter, and that the law should try to treat schools and pupils with some sensitivity.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman says about the apparent differences between the options open to locally maintained schools and grant-maintained schools. However, the Bill must reflect the essential differences between the two types of schools. Grant- maintained schools have chosen, by definition, a degree of autonomy in curricular, management and other matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in curricular matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, they have in relation to religious education, as I have said. Such schools have chosen that grant-maintained status freely. It is natural and right that that choice should be reflected in the arrangements. Schools that decide to remain in the LEA maintained sector, whether out of inertia or preference, should expect to have their interest in these matters, as in others, fully represented by the local authority. One must presume that they are content with that and that the arrangements suit them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the Minister has said, and it is very helpful. However, I am confused about the position of voluntary aided schools, which may be Anglican or of some other faith. Under the agreed syllabus at the moment it is possible for such schools to take part in the curriculum, yet there exists also the bishops' syllabus in both Anglican and Catholic schools. Will such schools be shoved out from the LEAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no change in the position of voluntary aided schools. The hon. Gentleman need not worry that clause 10 will make a material difference to their status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 11</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>STANDING ADVISORY COUNCILS ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask some questions about the composition of the standing advisory councils on religious education and about the procedure described in clause 11.I have studied circular 3/89, issued by what was then the Department of Education and Science on 20 January 1989, entitled "The Education Reform Act 1988: Religious Education and Collective Worship". I paid special attention to the section dealing with the composition and proceedings of the standing advisory councils on religious education, and to annex B, which details their composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the Minister's earlier remark that each of the groups would be composed of between three and eight members, as I had resorted to the circular to discover whether it contained advice or guidance about how many people should belong to the groups. I realise that the number of members is irrelevant in the sense that
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
each group is entitled to one vote. However, the number of members could be important in reflecting the experience and diversity of faith in any local authority area. One of my questions has, therefore, been answered. However, the Church of England and other churches within the Protestant tradition could have many more than eight full-time ministers. In setting a figure, will the local authority consult the Church of England or will there be consultation with the other faiths in the area to agree a reasonable number for each of the committees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure set out in clause 11 follows the Education Reform Act 1988 to take account of the fact that the grant-maintained schools have a specific representation. Is the Minister aware of any disputes having arisen during consultation about the composition of a particular group? I would not anticipate any problems although it is interesting that the 1988 Act and the Bill, while allowing for consultation, also allow the local authority to appoint a person to a group within the standing advisory council who may not have majority support within the group that that person is supposed to represent. I understand that it may be difficult for a group of grant-maintained schools, for example, to come to an agreement. Have other groups faced difficulties under the 1988 Act? Is the clause an extreme fallback position which will ensure that the local authority consults about the composition of the committee but which must allow for possible difficult circumstances when an overall agreement cannot be reached? Will the Minister please clarify the position in the light of his Department's experience of how the 1988 Act works in respect of those groups?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already given an assurance on one of the two points that I want to make. In the White Paper there was tremendous emphasis on the Christian tradition. While it is true that schools in the overwhelming majority of LEAs will be in the Christian tradition, we want a specific assurance from the Minister that, in other LEAs, different religions will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the role of LEAs has been crucial in keeping alive the teaching of religious knowledge. If, under the SACREs, they do not have the resources to continue their present training and their advice service, they will be unable to continue that role—they could become rather ineffective talking shops. Would the Minister give assurances on those points please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) and for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) for taking part in the debate. I shall try to reassure them and to respond to the points that they raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend referred to the composition of various committees under SACREs. There are no limits on the size of the membership of each committee. My example of between three and eight members is typical, but there is no statutory limit on the number. The other denominations committee is sometimes larger because, by definition, there are often several local faith communities. It is up to the LEAs to consult sensibly and to ensure that they have rational arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend, asked about the consultation process and whether any disputes have occurred under the rubric of the 1988 Act. I assure him that no problems have arisen on agreeing membership for the SACREs. My Department is aware of one case only,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
in which a formal complaint has been made about the membership of the other denominations committee. The arrangements have worked in a fairly consensual way—to use the word of the hon. Member for Stretford—and I think that those arrangements have stood the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemsworth rightly emphasised the great importance that chapter eight of the White Paper attached to the mainly Christian tradition of religious education in this country. The Government believe that that is very important, but that does not mean that we do not recognise the growing significance of other faiths in our community—one could not say otherwise, in the light of recent events that have dramatised that point. We believe that other faiths and religions should be adequately represented and the arrangements will allow for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemsworth also asked about the LEA training and advice for religious education. It is for LEAs to continue to monitor the way in which they should provide for SACREs. They have the principle responsibility of ensuring that SACREs work effectively. One must assume that their effectiveness will depend upon not only advice—as the hon. Member for Hemsworth said—but training, when appropriate. It is not a matter for central Government intervention, but for LEAs to determine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will such resources be available? Will the Government consciously think of the extra resources? Far too often, LEAs are blamed for holding too much money centrally. The provision of religious education is a case in which central funding is important. That important function should be retained by the LEAs and should not be devolved to the schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that funding would be decided by each LEA. I am not aware of any guidance from my Department to suggest that a certain proportion of the funds available to LEAs should be kept centrally for that purpose. If I am wrong and there is such guidance, I shall contact the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the Minister if I quote what his colleague said in a parliamentary answer. The Under-Secretary of State for Schools stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the responsibility of local education authorities to allocate the resources at their disposal to ensure that they, their schools and standing advisory councils on religious education are able to meet their statutory responsibilities in respect of religious education and collective worship."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 3 July 1992; Vol. 210, c. 713.]</p></blockquote>
Let me reiterate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth; if an LEA must allocate part of its budget to meet that responsibility, that sum must be taken into account when its funding is determined. That would prevent that allocation from being squeezed if the LEA is under pressure from other demands.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was always under the impression that the Labour party favoured allowing local authorities discretion and autonomous powers, especially when many such authorities—although, thankfully, not all—are Labour controlled.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would retain the responsibility, but I shall take advice on the question of additional funding and let the hon. Gentleman know. I imagine that LEAs will have to provide those services from their own resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having some difficulty with this, as is the Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth asked whether 100 per cent. of the budget would be delegated to the grant-maintained schools if opting out reached 100 per cent. If that were so, where would the money come from to administer SACREs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that they would remain an LEA responsibility. The funding arrangements would reflect that. The LEAs will retain the responsibility to convene and organise SACREs. It must be assumed that the funds will be taken from their normal budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bo wis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that LEAs will continue to have certain responsibilities, such as for school transport, no matter how many schools become grant-maintained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a helpful point. The LEAs will retain a range of important residual responsibilities, even after all the schools in an area have become grant-maintained, to quote the example given by the hon. Member for Devonport. The support of SACREs is another example of those residual responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is dodging the issue. Local authorities have all sorts of responsibilities, for which they are given a budget. However, certain things will suffer if the specific duties are not taken into account. Without a recognition of the cost of running SACREs effectively, SACREs and effective religious teaching will go out of the window. What worries me is that local authorities will be unable to retain religious advisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman exaggerates. Local authorities have that responsibility now. They are the traditional and most appropriate bodies to have the responsibility for religious teaching and other residual aspects of educational provision. Those costs are reflected in the existing arrangements, and local authorities must ensure that this vital aspect of education is maintained. That will be done in part by ensuring that the SACREs are properly run and supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, even after the 100 per cent. point has been reached, LEAs will be responsible for truancy, exclusions, suspensions, admissions, statementing, special needs support, adult education, the operation of the grant system and so on. What percentage of funds will a LEA hold back from its central budget to carry out those duties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot possibly answer that. It is too far in the future. The hon. Gentleman asks about circumstances in which 100 per cent. of schools are grant maintained. We cannot foresee the arrangements for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government have an interest in overall funding. They take account of LEA responsibilities when they give money to local government. It is up to the local authority to decide how to allocate those resources. Central Government makes money available to local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
authorities according to standard spending assessments. Local authorities decide how much money to allocate to SACREs or any other purpose. That is the main principle of the financial relationship between central Government and local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State for Schools, who is currently redundant, says that it is not important. But the point is important for religious education and for its general implications for the relationship that will continue between LEAs and schools even when 100 per cent. of schools have opted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be unable to answer my question today, but will he answer further parliamentary questions to make clear the method of assessing funds, now and in the future? It is important to know how the spending assessment is made and how it will be made in future, so that we can assess adequate funding for grant-maintained and LEA schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to give the hon. Gentlemans appropriate, information about what has happened in the past. However, I cannot speculate about the future, especially not about the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman assumed in his question. What will happen if 100 per cent. of schools in an area become grant maintained is terra incognita and it would be unwise to speculate about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Resource implications for religious education are a long-term problem. The main problem is the shortage of teachers trained in religious education. However, the resource implications are not all-important. Recently, I attended a meeting of the governing body of a school that was reviewed by HMI, which pointed out that that school did not follow the agreed syllabus. That decision had nothing to do with resources. The head teacher and the teacher-governors recognised that they could give up their personal, social and moral education syllabus and follow the agreed syllabus immediately without extra resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. Opposition Members exaggerate when they say that those changes will have significant resource implications. LEAs provide support for SACREs and there is no reason why that should not continue when they have the residual role to which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and others have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main problem is the central funding, not the funding within schools. A change of syllabus may or may not have resource implications for the school. Heavens, some schools have books going back years; when Shakespeare swings back into fashion he can be resurrected. The implications for resources are at the centre. The human resources at the centre provide a crucial back-up. As the hon. Member for Wyre Valley said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wyre Forest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. My problem is that Wyre Forest is not terra firma for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Human resources need to be cherished because, as the hon. Member for Wyre Forest said, very few people are qualified to teach religious education or to provide
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
instruction on personal and moral values. It is often the Latin, chemistry or French teacher who takes the religious education class. That is why it is cost effective to have a person at the centre who can train those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Clearly, for religious education to be alive and well and successfully conducted in any LEA it is important to have people on the spot who can deliver that education. But there will be no fundamnental change from the present position. Human resources are always important, as are books and equipment. Local authorities will still have to make their own dispositions, and will still have the responsibility for convening and supporting SACREs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important part of our debate and has a bearing on earlier discussions. Current funding for grant-maintained schools is based on the LMS formula plus the 15 per cent. on-cost. If 100 per cent. of schools were grant-maintained, funding would be 100 per cent. of that budget plus 15 per cent. Therefore, the LEA's financial base would diminish. If the LEA has to give more and more money to the grant-maintained sector, there will be fewer and fewer resources to maintain central services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making assumptions about the future funding arrangements for local authorities. He is correct about the current arrangements, but I cannot comment on future arrangements. The Government are shortly to consult on the common funding formula and these matters will be clarified as a result of those consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must pursue this important point further. The Minister says that we are looking too far into the future. However, in an authority such as Hillingdon—which the Government have described as their flagship—64 per cent. of schools in the secondary sector have opted out, and if two more ballots were held and parents voted to opt out, that figure would increase to 76 per cent. by April. That authority would disband and the funding agency would take over the responsibility for financing all those schools. Therefore, by April, Hillingdon could have all the responsibilities that I outlined earlier but without the necessary funding. April is not far into the future. Has the Minister estimated how much money Hillingdon will need to carry out those residual duties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman does not fully grasp the position. The local authority would not disband merely because more than 75 per cent. of schools in the area were grant-maintained. It would remain responsible for the minority of schools within its sector and continue to have residual responsibilities under the headings that the hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier. He exaggerates the position: a core of funding will remain with the LEA. It will be for the authority to decide how best to dispose of its resources to support SACREs or for any other purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should understand that there cannot be greater certainty about some matters. If he wants certainty about the future, he has come to the wrong place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are certain that some things will happen in the future. As an LEA with residual responsibiities, Hillingdon will have to retain funds. Those moneys cannot be both retained by the LEA and handed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
out as 100 per cent.-plus grants to the opted-out school system. Therefore, the amount available to those schools in Hillingdon will have to taper down sharply from here on in. Will the Minister please clarify the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the money from the central budget of the local authority, which now follows schools when they become grant-maintained, will continue to go to such schools. However, the hon. Gentleman is wrong about core funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LEA will be left with some core funding, not only for looking after the schools that are still within the maintained sector but for purposes that are consequent on the financial arrangements made by central Government for the overall support of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that even if a local authority loses 100 per cent. of its schools, it will receive an element for education in its standard spending assessment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there should be a treble act by the three Ministers, as I do not want to exclude Wales. The Minister of State at the Welsh Office had wonderful television coverage yesterday and we would not want him to have only a bit part today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is fundamental to the Bill. If Hillingdon was a private company, it would face bankruptcy. The burden of centrally funded services is so great that they cannot be funded under the present mechanism if moneys continue to be transferred at the same rate to schools that opt out. The financial structure simply cannot co-exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he will make it clear in written answers how much the Government estimate the costs for central headquarters in each LEA will be. Those estimates must have been done; they are essential to determine whether the distribution is fair or, as we believe, grossly unfair. Those estimates are central to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth, as without that headquarters funding, SACRE and other headquarter services cannot be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should table a question in the usual way and we shall try to give him a factual reply on the present position. We shall not speculate about the future because, as I said earlier, too many provisional factors are involved, including how the funding formula will work and the extent to which the pace and scale of the growth of grant maintenance will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an astonishing statement. We are planning education provision for the next 25 years, yet the Minister has just said that he does not know how it will work or how it will be paid for. That is a scandal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be aware that the consultation on the common funding formula is coming out this month. Hon. Members will be able to consider the matter when they see the documents. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman waits until then. I cannot give him answers to those questions now because so much will depend on the factors to which I have alluded. The hon. Gentleman must realise that the degree of certainty that he seeks is not possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does that help the Committee with this clause? We will have finished with clause 11 by the time the consultation is over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The financing comes later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should consider that the Committee's timetable is not necessarily geared to everything else that is going on in the financial arrangements between central Government and local authorities. It is naive to think that there should be a connection between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister cannot give a budget now. Ca va sans dire, but he could indicate the Government's general approach. It is clear that, as schools opt out and funds are taken away from LEAs, pro rata, some duties will remain with which LEAs will not be able to cope. I am worried about the pro rata business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Equally, as a classical scholar, he should understand that clause 11 is more about God than Mammon. The hon. Gentleman should realise that the funding arrangements and the important questions about core funding in local authorities will be dealt with under clause 71.I suggest that the hon. Gentleman waits until then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but the work of God must be done by the hands of man. Mammon's power lies in rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's—a parable that involved a coin. We need coin to ensure that the SACREs are effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Gentleman will have a whip round for his own purposes before Christmas. However, I emphasise that I cannot go beyond what I have said already as it would be unwise and misleading for me to do so. The degree of certainty that Opposition Members seek does not exist. I apologise for that, but that is the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, clause 11 allows for the proper representation on standing advisory councils on religious education of the governors of relevant grant-maintained schools at the point when 75 per cent. of primary or secondary pupils are taught in grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SACREs are permanent bodies. They were required in every local authority for the first time by the Education Reform Act 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister said that clause 11 would enable local authorities to choose governors of grant-maintained schools for representation in the group for the standing advisory council. However, although the clause states that governing bodies will be consulted, it does not state that members of the governing body should be in the group. Is that the Government's intention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's intention is that the people who represent grant-maintained schools should be acceptable to the majority of the governing bodies of the grant-maintained schools, not that those bodies should select the individuals concerned. That is not a matter for the LEAs. It is a matter for general selection, and it should be acceptable to the relevant constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schools represented in these arrangements will be those for which an agreed syllabus is required. Such schools include former county schools, other non-religious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
grant-maintained schools and former controlled schools. The responsibility for religious education and for collective worship, as an important part of the role of governing bodies of grant-maintained schools, needs to be reflected in the arrangements in that way. It is right that they should receive advice on matters arising from religious education and collective worship from a body that reflects a range of local education and faith interests. The SACREs will, and do, provide that advice. The Government consider it important that grant-maintained schools are fully represented in that framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that at present grant-maintained schools have between them one non-voting representative on a SACRE. That is appropriate while most schools remain within LEA control. However, when a significant number of pupils are being taught in grant-maintained schools, it is right that such schools should have a separate group to represent their interests on the SACRE—hence the importance of the 75 per cent. trigger. That will help to ensure that the SACREs take all relevant factors into account when giving advice on religious education and worship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that the Minister is saying that grant-maintained schools will increase their representation on a SACRE in effect until they dictate the SACRE's syllabus. They will then opt out, leaving the LEA schools with inappropriate syllabuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there is no question of grant-maintained schools dictating anything in that respect. They will have exactly the same rights—of influence and veto—on SACREs as the other committees. The hon. Gentleman knows that each committee has one vote. The rights of grant-maintained schools will be exactly analogous to those of the other interests represented on a SACRE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 11 is entirely consistent with the main thrust of part I of the Bill, which the Committee discussed at such enormous length. It will ensure appropriate arrangements for grant-maintained schools as they grow and assume a more important role in the educational firmament. For those reasons I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I have two administrative questions about clause 11(6), which deals with an LEA's ability to remove a person representing grant-maintained schools from membership of a SACRE when the 75 per cent. trigger has been reached
	<br><blockquote><p>"if in the opinion of the local education authority he"—</p></blockquote>
or she—
	<br><blockquote><p>"ceases to be acceptable as such to the governing bodies of the majority of such schools."</p></blockquote>
Unlike the equivalent provision in clause 10(6), clause 11(6) does not go on to say that the local education authority has an obligation to re-appoint someone who is acceptable. Would that not mean that the number of people representing grant-maintained schools would diminish gradually if the LEA were to act in that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, is a caveat implicit in clause 11(6), equivalent to the one explicit in clause 11(5), which states that, when appointing,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local education authority shall take all reasonable steps to assure themselves that"</p></blockquote>
the appointee
	<br><blockquote><p>"is acceptable as such to the governing bodies of the majority of"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
grant-maintained schools? I hope that the same caveat applies when a person is removed—that governing bodies should be consulted to establish whether that person is unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to clarify those matters. The right to re-appoint in clause 11(6) is taken as read, as the committees are permanent standing committees. Therefore, it would be natural to re-appoint people to such committees, as well as to remove people from them. It would be strange if local authorities did not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On subsection (5), the requirement to take reasonable steps must apply in all cases. It is assumed that local authorities will behave reasonably because Parliament will have imposed that duty on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friends and I commend clause 11 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 252, in page 7, line 25, leave out paragraph (b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 253, 254 and 255, Government new clause 11—
	<i>Power to transfer functions under preceding provisions of Chapter VII</i>—and Government new clause 12—
	<i>Power to transfer functions under preceding provisions of Chapter VIII.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the Committee that these amendments look more fearsome than they actually are. In the light of previous debates, I would expect the Committee to welcome the amendments. I shall explain them briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 252 and 253, new clause 11 and new clause 12 are intended to clarify the potential role of the FAS at a point in the future when the Secretary of State delegates certain functions. As presently drafted clause 12 provides for the Secretary of State to delegate to the funding authority, by order, certain of his functions in relation to grant-maintained schools. The clause lists those functions and goes on to spell out that the Secretary of State can delegate functions generally or in circumstances set down in the order. In other words, the Secretary of State can attach conditions to the delegation of the functions to the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help if I summarised for the Committee the intention behind these amendments. Our intention is, and always has been, that the FAS should be able to take decisions on only two important issues: proposals by the governing body of a GM school to discontinue that school and proposals by the governing body of a GM school to change its character if either there are no objections to the proposals, or the Secretary of State does not "call them in".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, when delegating the functions, would attach those two conditions anyway, but we believe that it is right to put the matter beyond any doubt and therefore suggest that they be put on the face of the Bill. We want to make it absolutely clear that the FAS will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
able to take decisions on those two matters only when there are no objections or when the Secretary of State has not called the proposals in—in other words we want to reflect the present LEA scenario. There will be no question of the FAS taking a unilateral decision about a change in character of a GM school, proposed by the governing body of that GM school, in the face of opposition from the LEA. Such a proposal would have to go to the Secretary of State for determination and he would judge each case on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendments Nos. 254 and 255, if the governing body of a grant-maintained school wishes to pay its members' travelling, subsistence or other allowances it must apply to the Secretary of State for approval of its scheme of allowances. That is a routine procedural matter. Paragraph 14 of schedule 5 contains the same provisions on this matter as section 55(5) of the Education Reform Act 1988. To date 77 grant-maintained schools—around 28 per cent. of the total number operating as at 1 September 1992—have applied for approval of their schemes under section 55(5). That is a largely mechanical process: the Department requires that the rates used in schemes must not exceed those produced annually by the Department of the Environment for the payment of allowances to local government members. The need for approval reflects the fact that money for these allowances comes from annual maintenance grant: it ensures that governing bodies are not left open to the suggestion that they are paying themselves excessive allowances at the expense of the rest of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept that the amendments, modest though they are, better define the relationship between the funding agency for schools and the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that a significant change of character would have to be referred to the Secretary of State rather than be delegated to the funding agency. That begs the question, what is meant by "a significant change of character"? A grant-maintained school in Bromley was allowed to alter its admissions procedure to admit 10 per cent. of pupils on the basis of aptitude. Would a 10 per cent. selection procedure based on ability constitute a "significant change of character"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We shall discuss the important distinction between ability and aptitude later in our proceedings. In the White Paper, we made it clear that we wished to encourage schools to specialise. Aptitude should be recognised as a criterion for enabling a school to specialise. However, selection on the basis of ability is deemed to constitute a "significant change of character" that would require the approval that was mentioned earlier. I cannot imagine that people would not object to such a proposal. Our amendments are modest and straightforward and I hope that the Committee will accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the Department's decision to remove clause 12(2)(b) and (d) is eminently sensible. The unamended clause suggests that the Secretary of State will abrogate to the funding agency his powers to deal with substantial matters, such as changing the character of a school or proposing to close a school, which should be debated in the democratic arena. The new
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
clauses replace five lines in the Bill with 83 lines, which explain in some depth the way in which the Government hope that the procedure will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pored over new clauses 11 and 12. We could regard them as one clause, because the procedure that they outline is almost the same, although they cover slightly different circumstances. The Minister was at pains to emphasise the background to the clauses and that the Government had always intended the proposals to operate only when no objections existed to changing the character of a school or closing a school. However, under new clause 11(5)(a), the Secretary of State would have the power to decide whether the proposals that were presented to him about changing the character of the school required his approval or whether the funding agency could make that decision. What will be the criteria for the Secretary of State to determine whether he will take the decision or whether it will be passed to the funding agency to reject, approve, or, after further consultation, to modify the proposal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under new clause 11, if the Secretary of State decides that he should not concern himself about the matter, the funding authority can vary the governors' proposal, consulting the governors but no one else. At that stage there is no possibility of further public consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding to modify the proposal, the funding authority may already be taking account of submissions under the process set out in new clause 11. Given the new clause's references to other parts of the Bill—clauses 87(1) and 89(3) for example—I thought that the Secretary of State might have been more specific about how the process would work in the slightly different circumstances referred to in new clause 11. It is especially important to know something about the Secretary of State's criteria for deciding whether the proposal requires his approval. At the later stage, if the funding authority takes a decision to change the governors' original proposal, a further round of public consultation would be appropriate in such an important proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the character of the school is to be changed, consultation with the parents of children already at the school would also be appropriate, although it could be argued, however, that wider consultation was needed. The change would be significant to parents in a wider catchment area, although parents living in reasonable proximity to a school are most likely to want to send their children there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the governors first make their proposal to change the character, parents and people living in the vicinity will have had the chance to make their views known. However, in new clause 11(6)(b), the funding authority can decide to modify the character of the school, which is not subject to further consultation, other than with the school governors. What thought have the Government given to that issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are concerned about parents having their say in the process of determining to what type of school they might send their children. The Government have been at pains to make that process subject to a more detailed and rational period of consultation than was originally outlined in the Bill. The funding authority was to have had the final decision, for which it would have been totally unaccountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has set out another process, which he rightly says is better than that in the Bill. It is welcome for its attempt to introduce an element of democratic scrutiny.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
The Minister must tell us clearly whether the Secretary of State would want to make that final decision or whether he would leave it to the funding authority. Would the funding authority have the power to change proposals without consultation? If the Minister cannot tell us that, some questions need to be answered. Perhaps I missed something in the Minister's explanation that took account of my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a lot of discussion about concerns over the loss of democratic accountability and about the establishment of a quango—the funding authorities—which would be remote and undemocratic. Clause 12, as it stood, made clear that the Secretary of State might delegate further powers to the funding authorities. Those included powers to decide possible changes to the size, character or even the possible closure of grant-maintained schools. That concerned all Opposition Members. It is pleasing to note that it also concerned the Minister as well, which is why he has tabled this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled my own amendment—amendment No. 125—which addresses the closure and possible changes to the character or size of a school. Through the amendment, I argued that it was inappropriate for decisions of such magnitude to be passed to the unelected, undemocratic quango—the funding authorities. Therefore, I am delighted that the Minister has tabled his amendment, which addresses at least half of the arguments in my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time, the Minister has had to use the phrases that we have frequently used, such as, "This is such a modest proposal that I am sure that it will be accepted by all members of the Committee". I have used that phrase to describe my amendments on more than one occasion. The Minister did not go so far as to invoke the Christmas spirit, but perhaps that was unnecessary. The Minister said that his proposed amendments are lengthy, but their impact is relatively simple: to avoid the possibility of handing decision-making powers to the funding authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment No. 125—I wish that the Minister had included this element in his amendment—went further and proposed that the Secretary of State should bring orders before both Houses of Parliament so that vital decisions about closure and change of character could be made by democratically elected Members of the House of Commons. I understand that if the Government amendments are passed, my amendment must fall, as one cannot delete what has already been deleted. Therefore, I shall have to delay until a later stage the comments that I wish to make about the importance of allowing Parliament to have a say on such important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the assumption that we will get reassuring answers to the questions quite properly raised by the hon. Member for Bridgend, I am delighted that the Minister has brought forward proposals similar to my own. I hope that they will get the Committee's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: All Conservative Members accept that my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
Minister is human. The only Pope in this Committee sits on the Labour Benches. Only the real Pope is infallible, and then only when he speaks ex cathedra.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly disappointed in the tenor of the remarks by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). He seemed to imply that I was reluctant to acknowledge a good argument made by the Opposition and to embody it in the Bill. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am an eminently reasonable man. I will repeat what I have said before: I am more than happy to commend amendments to the Committee that I think will improve the Bill. That is the function of a Minister in a Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the welcome from the hon. Member for Bath for my modest amendment. I am sorry that I could not go as far as he wanted, but I am sure that we can now make progress with a degree of harmony that has only taken us about 60 hours to achieve. However, some of the better things in life come more slowly than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend made some fair and important points. When grant-maintained schools initiate minor and modest proposals, the Secretary of State will be content for the FAS to deal with them. The matter automatically will be referred upwards to the Secretary of State if any objections are made. Only if no objections are made will that not happen and the matter be left with the FAS. The Secretary of State will almost certainly exercise his power to deal with significant or major proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right to assume that anybody could object to such a proposal, and not only the parents of children in the school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, provided that there are 10 persons. It is, as now, a very open procedure, and that should appeal to the democratic instincts of Oppostion Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me what sort of issues might arise. There might be a change of age range and selection by ability might be part of the proposal. The changes might have an impact on surrounding or neighbouring schools. Those characteristics would be considered by the Secretary of State who would assess whether to call them in. Whether the matter should be dealt with by the funding agency or the Secretary of State would depend on the nature of those characteristics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Secretary of State will be the final arbiter in those cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, as he is now and will continue to be under the Bill. That constitutional thread—thread of policy and principle—runs through the provisions of the existing regime and will run through the new regime. I do not want to minimise this part of the Bill; it is important. The hon. Member for Bath captured the flavour well. I hope that this modest improvement to the Bill deals with some of the Opposition's concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is still one matter that I would like to take further. The Minister referred to minor or small changes to the character of the school. Would I be right in assuming that a significant change of character would be defined according to the guidance issued by the Department of Education? If there were a significant increase in the intake of the school—for example, if it were to double—that would be a significant change in the character of the school. Are such changes covered by the guidance published by his Department?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
I am still not entirely happy about how the Secretary of State is to use his discretion. The funding authority may modify a proposal, but the public would have no way to express their views. The Minister has not dealt with that point. Can he allay my fears? There may be misgivings about the final decision of the funding authority, especially as it will not be accountable to the parents of the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point, the criteria are contained in guidance published by my Department and that will continue to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for not picking up the hon. Gentleman's other point. He is correct that the funding agency will be able to make minor modifications—subject to the well-established overriding principle of reasonableness—if it thinks it appropriate to make the proposals acceptable. The Committee must bear in mind that we are discussing only proposals to which no objection has been raised. That is the principle of the amendment. We are trying to route minor, routine proposals to which there are no objections, even under the most liberal objection arrangements. They would go to the funding agency for final disposition only in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right: in such cases the funding agency for schools would be able to make minor modifications if it thought it necessary to make the proposals workable, given its wider responsibilities. At that stage, there would be no further possibility of hearing objections, as the hon. Gentleman said. If one is not careful, the circularity will lead to an almost indefinite postponement of decision taking. The amendment is procedurally cautious. I hope that the Committee agrees with me that it will improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the Minister's further explanation of how the new clause would work. I accept that it is better than the Bill as drafted and we will not oppose it but I ask the Minister to think more carefully about modification. He stressed that the funding authority would make only minor, reasonable modifications, but the new clause does not say that. It states that modifications can be made. Nothing in the new clause would place a restraining hand on the funding authority when it takes a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we can expect 99.9 per cent. of the funding agency's decisions to be reasonable. However, if the modification went beyond the Minister's definition of "slight" to enable the proposal to work better in practice, nothing in the new clause would enable the Secretary of State to intervene. Is there a residual long-stop which would enable the Secretary of State to step in if he felt that the modification went beyond what he considered reasonable? Will the funding authority automatically send its final decision to the Secretary of State? I hope that the Minister can allay my fears in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can come to the hon. Gentleman's rescue, albeit by a circuitous route. There is always the overriding power of our old friend section 68 of the Education Act 1944. I am delighted that it has come to our rescue as I know how much Opposition Members enjoy referring to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was so well drafted after a long period of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the funding agency's modification were found to be unreasonable, that complaint could be taken to the Secretary of State who could examine the matter under section 68 of the 1944 Act. Therefore there is a safety net, which I shall invoke when we discuss another amendment. Section 68 is powerful and all-embracing. It provides the assurances that the Committee seeks. Clause 6(3) applies section 68 of the 1944 Act exclusively to the funding agency for schools. The loophole is, therefore, closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This brief clause contains only 26 words. Its brevity complements the starkness of the responsibilities that it gives the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 covers disputes between LEAs and the funding agency about their respective functions. From the Minister's glowing words, we might believe that disputes would not occur. According to him, the Bill is clarity itself; the lines of responsibility are clearly drawn. There should be no reason for dispute between a LEA and the funding agency. Therefore, it is interesting that the Bill acknowledges that such disputes are likely to occur. That gives the lie to many Government arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will cause confusion. It blurs the lines of responsibility. It will cause disputes between the LEAs and the funding agency. There is merit in acknowledging that the parallel, or shared, or dual responsibilities of the bodies will cause disputes, to empower the Secretary of State to resolve such disputes is not the appropriate way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the powers that the Bill grants the Secretary of State. At the last count, there were 44. That figure increases and adds to the powers that the Education Reform Act 1988 gave the Secretary of State. The clause is another example of making the Secretary of State all-powerful. If a dispute arises, the Secretary of State will decide its outcome. The clause is another example of making the Secretary of State all-powerful. If a dispute arises, the Secretary of State will decide its outcome. The Secretary of State not only sets the rules by which we have to play, and selects one of the teams—the funding agency, whose members he will appoint—he is also the referee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be an independent system to resolve disputes. Clause 13 will not provide for that. The Secretary of State will be partial. He will appoint all the members of the funding agency, and also resolve disputes between the funding agency and LEAs. That is neither fair nor just.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
Disputes will arise about delicate and contentious matters. We are discussing functions that include providing places, deciding whether a school has changed its character significantly, considering the size of schools and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the example that I gave earlier, the size of schools could be especially contentious. A proposal by a grant-maintained school to double its intake could threaten the life of another school in the same area. My hon. Friend has raised an important point that is likely to be the subject of a dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. The Government are unable to recognise that, within a LEA, there is one family of school children. The Bill, which the Minister explained ably, suggests that there will be two separate systems of education. One system will be formed when the 10 per cent. trigger is activated and the Secretary of State makes a clause 7 order. The funding agency will deal with one system: the grant-maintained sector. The LEA will cover the other system, in which it will retain its powers to plan and remove surplus places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those systems cannot be mutually exclusive. Any decision that allows the grant-maintained sector to
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
increase the size of a school will affect the LEA sector from which the new pupils will come. The Government have failed to recognise that the decisions of one sector will affect the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 begins to tackle those issues. It acknowledges that disputes will occur. It recognises that the problems that the Opposition have identified will arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A dispute could arise about a fundamental issue, such as a proposal to double the intake of a grant-maintained school, which could threaten another school in the area. To expect the Secretary of State to resolve it, although he is supposed to be unbiased—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all suppose that the Secretary of State will be unbiased and even-handed in handling a dispute.
