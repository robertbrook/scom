	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Birds (Registration Charges) Bill ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
This is the first time that I have participated in a Second Reading Committee, so I hope that it is not inappropriate to say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms Ruddock) in Committee as I am to see so many of my hon. Friends who take a great interest in the registration of birds and the registration of sellers of dead birds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Full notes on clauses are available for hon. Members who wish to study the Bill in detail, as I know some of them will. I shall, therefore, be brief and content myself with drawing their attention to the main provisions in the Bill. It is a short Bill which will clarify the powers to charge fees for the registration of sellers of certain dead wild birds and the registration of certain captive birds under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has three main provisions. First, it will provide a clear statutory basis for the charges made, and the fees previously collected, by the Department of the Environment under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 relating to bird registration from 28 September 1982 to 20 May 1996 and the registered sellers of dead wild birds scheme from 28 September 1982, until that scheme was discontinued in December 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Bill will provide a clear statutory basis for the recovery of bird registration charges made between 21 May 1996, when an announcement was made to the House that the requirement for the payment of any fees in respect of bird registration would be suspended, and the date when the Bill comes into force. Thirdly, it will provide a clear statutory basis for future charges for the bird registration scheme—a service that we are required to provide under section 7 of the 1981 Act—and for the registered sellers of dead wild birds, should such a scheme again become operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will affect about 1,000 keepers of birds. It will restore the situation to what the Department and bird keepers had previously believed it to be and will not remove any rights that they expected to have. It makes no other changes to the 1981 Act. It is an uncontroversial measure and I ask the Committee to recommend that it be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Ms Ruddock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>HON. MEMBERS</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, Hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>10.33 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Ruddock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, Deptford</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Jones, and members of the Committee for that welcome. I suspect that hon. Members are looking forward to their second breakfast, so I am sorry to say that I propose to detain the Committee for a short while. This is the first time that I have been a member of a Second Reading Committee. It is also the first time that I have served on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones—an opportunity which I welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the Bill is necessary to deal with a technical problem that arose following the charges, which were only discovered to be a problem in 1994. We support the Government in seeking to clarify the basis on which charges should be made. However, it is somewhat disturbing—indeed, remarkable—that it has taken 12 years to discover the problems caused by the poor drafting of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and that it has taken almost three more years for corrections to be proposed. We are pleased that the Government decided to take action, although we expected to have the opportunity for a welcome debate on how the bird registration scheme was progressing. The Minister's remarks were extremely brief, but I wish to make several pertinent points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Bill deals with the problem of charging for registration, it is worth considering the changes that were made to the list of birds originally registered under schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981—birds required to be registered if kept in captivity. The 1994 review led to the removal of about two thirds of the 65 birds named in that schedule; now only 43 birds are listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The birds removed from the list included all non-British birds of prey except for globally endangered hawks. Only after intense pressure from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds did the Government agree to add a list of globally endangered hawks to schedule 4. It is important to recognise that change, and we should note the consequences. Three birds of prey native to Britain—the sparrowhawk, the kestrel and the buzzard—were removed from that list and remain off it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand the reasons. The Minister nods in agreement; I expect that he is saying to himself that they were good reasons. There had been previous declines, but when that change was made those birds were numerous in the wild. It was thought best to direct the available policing powers to a more limited list, but we do not know how many of those birds are now kept in captivity. I urge the Minister to keep under review those birds that were previously listed. Having once decided that particular species required to be registered, we should think of possible future changes in their populations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deregulation has made it difficult for us to assess our fears, but we are certain that our fears are potentially strong enough to say that no further birds should be removed from the registration scheme. The Minister said that the Bill did not include a proposal to remove the birds from the registration scheme, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
fact that two thirds of birds have been removed during the past five years makes me somewhat cautious. Deregulation has highlighted three main worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first concern is that lifting the registration requirement has encouraged people to take birds from the wild, which is, of course, illegal. Of particular concern are birds that neither breed in the United Kingdom nor are on the list of globally endangered species added in 1994 to schedule 4 of the 1981 Act. There is now no disincentive to stop people keeping such birds in the UK, which thus makes it easier for them to take birds from the wild in other countries and bring them into the UK. I shall give an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RSPB has been involved in the prosecution of a case concerning six Eleanora's falcons that are thought to have been taken from the wild in the Mediterranean in 1996 and smuggled into the United Kingdom. There are only 4,500 pairs of those falcons in the world and before 1994 there were none in captivity in this country. In the absence of any registration of those birds, the discovery of their being here illegally has been a matter of chance. I would be the first to acknowledge—I know that the Minister will agree— that registration alone cannot stamp out smuggling and illegal trading. We believe, however, that the removal of the licence and registration requirement has made it much easier for people to contravene the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second concern is that the removal of the requirement for registration has an adverse effect on the monitoring of certain species that are important to British wildlife. In 1992—the last year for which the information is available—more than 1,100 sparrowhawks, 2,500 buzzards and almost 4,000 kestrels were held in captivity. Because those species have been removed from schedule 4, we have no means of knowing what the numbers now are or whether the birds that are kept in captivity are bred or illegally obtained from the wild.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our third concern is that the removal of the registration requirement can result in birds being kept in much worse conditions than they might previously have been, for the obvious reason that their owners are not likely to be detected. Those are all real concerns among those who value our birdlife, wildlife and biodiversity and it is important that the Minister assures us that, above and beyond today's proposal, the Government do not intend to support any further deregulation in the form of removing species from schedule 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative members of the Committee may think that I labour the point, but I do so because we have been told of people's fears that other proposals might be introduced in another place. We understand that there is some following elsewhere for proposals to remove hen harriers and possibly peregrine falcons from schedule 4. The Minister will be aware that there are currently only about 600 pairs of hen harriers and 1,200 pairs of peregrine falcons in the United Kingdom. They are rare and important species. Important research has been carried out during the past few months into hen harriers, which are already the subject of much illegal persecution in the form of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
shooting and the destruction of adult birds, chicks, nests and eggs. I hope that the Minister will put it on the record today that the Government will neither table nor accept any proposals to remove any further bird species from schedule 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must sadly be acknowledged that, no matter what schemes we put in place, there will always be illegal trading. For example, we know that goshawks and peregrine falcons are being taken from the wild and illegally kept in captivity; indeed, thefts are occurring between illegal owners. The ability to identify the true ownership of stolen birds and whether a bird has been bred in captivity or taken from the wild is vital in the policing of our wildlife legislation. I am glad to say that Nottingham university has pioneered the use of genetic analysis to assist in prosecutions for the illegal sale of birds of prey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In September 1995, one bird dealer was sent to prison for four months following an investigation involving not just the RSPB, with its renowned expertise, but 10 police forces. They carried out DNA testing of more than 80 peregrines, and were able to show that 23 birds were not the offspring of registered parent birds, as claimed by the dealer. The inquiry took 18 months and the cost of bringing the prosecution was approximately £9,000—so such prosecutions are expensive, time-consuming and detailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some might say, "All this over a few birds", but that illegal trade totally undermines the commitments that we have all made to the preservation of the biodiversity of our wildlife and our countryside. That is an enormously important issue. We can be pleased that such new aids are available, and we support the use of DNA testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject has been much studied by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), who speaks for the Labour party on animal welfare. I put to the Minister a proposal that we have developed which I know is supported by the RSPB: a single feather should be taken and attached to the registration form when a bird is registered under the scheme. That would enable any future disputes over ownership or legality to be easily settled by DNA testing. That is a simple, straightforward idea that would involve no additional administration costs—the only additional cost would be that of the DNA testing and analysis in the event of a dispute. That would make resolution of such disputes easy and straightforward. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that simple proposal, which would add a further dimension to the registration scheme, but which would not in itself add to whatever costs the Minister envisages as a consequence of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to ask a question about the charging regime. The explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The charges imposed will make a contribution towards the costs of administering the registration scheme."</p></blockquote>
Why only a contribution? I am told that a guesstimate of the cost of the scheme—taking account of the number of dealers and birds being registered—is as much as five times the charge that will be made. Is there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
really any place for the taxpayer directly subsidising those who seek to keep in captivity birds covered by the registration scheme? We think not, and so are at odds with the Government on that question. However, as I said at the outset, we will be glad to have clarification, because we believe the scheme to be important. Charges are appropriate and we want them to be levied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, I shall respond to the points made by the hon. Lady. I am sure that she understands that my initial remarks were brief because I was dealing with the technical aspects of the Bill. The hon. Lady has made some general comments about the bird registration scheme; she understands that the effect of the Bill will be to return the scheme and the charges under it to the position that pertained in May 1996, when registration fees collection was suspended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked why it has taken 12 years for the problem with the legal powers to be discovered. She may know that when the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was debated in the House, it was thought that its powers were adequate to support the charging regime. The change in attitude came about because of a review of the legal position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that that legal review took into account several cases, including a case from 1992 that had a material bearing on the powers for charging. Although it might be of interest to some members of the Committee, I shall not go into all the details of that case. I hope that the Committee will forgive me for not doing so. The decision was taken in all seriousness because we thought it important to put the charging powers on the correct basis in the light of the best possible legal advice and the views of the latest authorities on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the birds that are subject to registration, as the hon. Lady said, in May 1994 we changed the position as regards which birds were covered by the controls. Before that time, the controls under the scheme applied to all diurnal birds of prey and to 64 species of rare or irregular breeding British birds. The hon. Lady will know that by no means all British birds of prey are endangered. We thought it important to target the powers of the registration scheme on the birds whose conservation status was threatened. That resulted in a slimming down of the number of species in schedule 4. We thought it important to target resources on endangered birds, not to have unnecessary controls on birds which were not endangered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked me to give undertakings about proposals to remove other birds from schedule 4. We have considered such matters on the basis of protecting endangered birds. Obviously, we regard that as part and parcel of our overall framework of powers to protect such birds. We shall consider the schedule in that way in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Ruddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister on the matter of hen harriers. If the Minister were to say that there were an objective definition of "endangered", some people would argue that hen harriers were not in that category. Will the Minister give a view on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would want to consider the evidence on any species. It would be necessary to consider all the evidence to discover whether the species that the hon. Lady mentioned was endangered. We shall use the schedule and the powers to protect endangered species, but we do not want unnecessary controls, which bring the system into disrepute. We want the controls to be part and parcel of our overall measures to protect such birds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady knows, we have made a good deal of progress in protecting birds in recent years, and I assure her that we shall continue to do so. I do not want to deal with the question of which birds might or might not be part of the schedule in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned threats to individual species of bird, some of which are in the schedule. Of course, we shall consider any problem that arises which might affect the conservation status of those species. She also referred to some illegal activities that are outside the registration scheme—the scheme would make no difference to them. I hope that the hon. Lady welcomes the actions that we have taken on wildlife crime and on the sort of illegal activities to which she referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of DNA—an important subject—I agree with the hon. Lady that we must keep abreast of the latest developments and use them to protect birds. We are sponsoring research on the DNA of birds. With any wild bird in captivity, the onus of proof is on the captor to prove that the bird is held legally. Of course, DNA testing enables a decision to be made on whether that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady will welcome the other measures that were taken to protect the species of birds that come within the ambit of the schedule. Those measures include our biodiversity plans, which are relevant because, as everyone knows, those birds are threatened by not only the deliberate actions of man but unintentional actions and a wide range of other circumstances, including agricultural practices. Our biodiversity plans protect those species and many others. We are taking positive steps to promote conservation.
