	<div class='legislation'>Draft Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) (No. 1) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Scotland Act 1998 (Consequential Modifications) (No. 1) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
This is a highly technical order. I shall try not to delay the Committee but I will provide a background explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is made under section 105 of the Scotland Act 1998. It makes a variety of amendments to legislation to take account of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Order contains the amendments that are required to come into force on 6 May and 20 May, in connection with the creation of the Parliament and the transfer of the Lord Advocate from the United Kingdom Government to the Scottish Executive. It also contains a small number of amendments that will come into force on 1 July but that need to be made now to pave the way for an order to be made under section 126(8) of the Act to define the offices in the Scottish Administration that are not ministerial. A second consquential modifications order will be laid in May to cover the bulk of the amendments that will come into force on 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order makes several main modifications. It modifies provision for the manner of taking oaths by the Lord Advocate and other members of the Scottish Executive. It extends to the Scottish Parliament the provision for exemption from postage of some petitions and addresses to Parliament and the limitation of the amount of postage recoverable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also excuses Members of the Scottish Parliament, members of the Scottish Executive and junior Scottish Ministers as of right from jury service in Northern Ireland. The Scotland Act already excuses them from jury service elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The order also excuses the Auditor-General for Scotland as of right from jury service in any part of the United Kingdom. It extends the scope of legal aid to cover references or appeals under the Scotland Act from superior courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in connection with devolution issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also amends the provisions of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 to enable the High Court to grant a convicted person bail, pending determination by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of an appeal against the determination of a devolution issue by the High Court, and to provide what will happen following the determination of such an appeal. It amends the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980 to ensure that Solicitor Advocates have a right of audience before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The order makes only those amendments that are considered necessary or expedient as a consequence of the Scotland Act. It is essentially a deeply technical instrument. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.33 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister described the order as deeply technical. I agree that it is a deep order, but not that it is technical. It contains much that none of us is in a good position to examine or understand in detail. In that sense, it is indeed technical. This is not an attack on this particular Minister or on his Department—orders will increasingly become part of the structure of our legislation—but in constitutional terms, the order is a outrage. I regret to say that previous Administrations of both colours have perpetrated the outrage, so it is not a partisan point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian H. Donohoe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be a first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I frequently try make points that are not partisan. However, it is for the Minister to establish the facts, because he is using a statutory instrument to amend primary legislation. That is rightly referred to as a Henry VIII attitude to law, because the fundamental principles of primary legislation are having their heads cut off each time such measures come before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one partisan point. Although previous Administrations have taken similar action—it was an outrage when they did so, too—the frequency and the depth, to use the Minister's term, of such actions has increased greatly, not least because the Government have introduced constitutional legislation of immense significance. The Minister regards the order as merely a modest foretaste and, no doubt, such actions will be much more evident in the larger order—I envisage one of telephone-book dimensions. That is a testament to the wide-ranging nature of the constitutional legislation; it requires the amendment of a tissue of other measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bow entirely to the deep learning and great astucity of other members of the Committee. Indeed, the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) was so assiduous in his investigation of the matters that the Committee considered previously that he was able to point out major problems with the voting system, which have since come to light in the press. Perhaps he will show us today that he has spent the better part of a couple of weeks with a group of Queen's counsel and others, studying each of the provisions that are hereby amended. He may dazzle us with his profound understanding of whether each amendment has been correctly drafted, but I regret to say that I am in no position to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might be misleading the Committee—if so, I apologise in advance—but I doubt that the Minister has spent the better part of two weeks looking at the detail of the order. I suspect that, in normal the way of Ministers, he asked the brilliant officials who serve him to investigate which measures needed amendment and to propose technical amendments—to use the Minister's term—which they assure him are right. They are very probably right and, very probably, most of the order is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I shall make a point about one of the provisions, but by and large, I suppose that I have a touchingly naive faith that the Government legal service and the brilliant administrative service have produced appropriate provisions. However, introducing such orders is no way to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such matters are the consequence of enormously important constitutional primary legislation and a tissue of other matters needed to be changed, they should have been debated when the original legislation was introduced. They should have gone through the many stages that primary legislation has to go through. There would then have been at least some chance of their being investigated in sufficient depth to enable those elected to Parliament and, indeed, those in the other place to have raised any serious difficulty. That will not happen this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly not tire the Committee with a request to trawl line by line through the order, but I have made it a principle since being elected to the House never to let slip an opportunity to mention that making such orders is not the proper way to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I turn to paragraph 11 of schedule 1 of the order, which is the only item that struck me immediately as relating to a point of fundamental significance on the devolution legislation. I bow to the superior wisdom of other members of the Committee if I have missed other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, paragraph 11 relates to a fundamental aspect of the devolution legislation. It puts in the hands, not of a new body but of a body whose remit is new—the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—the power to make a series of landmark decisions about the constitutional balance of the United Kingdom: the balance of power between the Scottish Parliament and the United Kingdom Parliament. The Judicial Committee will have relatively little to guide it in making those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know yet what legal status the Judicial Committee will accord to concordate. There have been at least three slightly but importantly varying answers from Ministers over the past months as to what that legal status will be. As it is not clear to Ministers whether concordats will he regarded as administerative acts that are subject to judicial review, it is not clear to us whether the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will begin to think that it ought to give leave to a judicial review of concordats. It would be an interesting development if it decided to close. We doubt whether the Lords who sit on the Judicial Committee have considered that issue, perhaps less the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing not with the great question of how the Judicial Committee will act, but with the consequential question of how people who feel aggrieved about the balance of powers will be able to take their grievances to it. I refer to the balance of powers established in the Act or, as the Act is vague on the matter, in the transfer of functions order or, as that order is vague about it too, in the concordats, where the meat of the matter will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people arguing such cases will probably be enormously wealthy—they will probably be the UK
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Government or the Scottish Government, and I regret to say that they will have virtually bottomless purses, although one will be greater than the other. We envisage that many tens of millions of pounds will probably be spent in hiring the world's most expensive lawyers to argue landmark constitutional cases before the Judicial Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph is about those at the opposite end of the spectrum. Some people, although perhaps not many, who find themselves needing to go to the Judicial Committee will have exiguous funds. I stand to be corrected if I have misunderstood, but I take it that paragraph 11 is designed to provide for that eventuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We wholly sympathise with that intent. Someone who has an axe to grind about that vital constitutional question but does not have the money to bring a case should be funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to explain how the provision will work in practice. I may have misunderstood my colleagues, but if the Lord Chancellor's proposals to remove civil action from the scope of legal aid are accepted, how will the provision work for those with legitimate axes to grind about devolution legislation or the concordats?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Pentlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. The Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, which is being amended, is Scottish legislation and is nothing to do with the Lord Chancellor. Any provisions that the Scottish Parliament make in relation to that Act will be Scottish and not necessarily the same as those made by the Lord Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Lady is obviously right that they are Scottish provisions. She may be right that it is not the intention of the Lord Advocate to conspire, so to speak, with the Lord Chancellor, and that it is not the intention of a Labour Government in Scotland—should there be one, as Labour hon. Members no doubt hope that there will be—to pursue the Lord Chancellor's logic in Scotland. If that is the Minister's answer, we shall rest as content as one can while not knowing what the governing party will be in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand what the Minister intends, as he is introducing the legislation. He will presumably have talked to the Lord Chancellor and to the Lord Advocate to discover whether it should apply to civil cases of the kind that I describe. If so, we would have no qualm with it. If not, what is it for? Why, as a consequence of the Scotland Act, should one expect people to bring cases before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council who would not otherwise do so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see why this provision is necessary, unless it is intended to cover the kind of case that I described. If it is, how does it cohere in the Minister's mind with the Lord Chancellor's proposals, to which the Lord Advocate must have signed up? I accept the hon. and learned Lady's point that the Scotland Act may be undermined—this may eventually happen with all Scottish legislation—by changes that the Minister, as a member of the United Kingdom Government, cannot control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Finally—I promise after this to sit down and leave the battle to the great experts from West Aberdeen and Kincardine and other such places, who will no doubt dazzle the Committee with further and much more detailed points—I would like to say that admire the Minister for his assiduity in these matters. I wish him great luck in tracing all consequences of the Scotland Act in other legislation. In particular, I wish him greater luck than that enjoyed by his opposite number in the Welsh Office, who, when transferring functions to the Welsh Assembly discovered to his surprise that he had included the transfer of powers over the Brompton cemetery in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin); he will have to put up with me rather than my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, because it is my turn. I have three questions, all of which may reflect my ignorance rather than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on page 2, paragraph 2 is entitled,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Modification of definition of 'pre-commencement enactment"'.</p></blockquote>
Why was it necessary to modify it? Was there something wrong with the previous definition? Despite my best efforts, I see nothing sinister in the wording, but I am always slightly worried when such changes are made. An explanation would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on pages 5 and 6, paragraph 13 of schedule 1 to the order makes provisions on bail. Although the Scotland Act is mentioned every now and then, I may have missed something when the Scotland Act was being debated in the House. Why should the Scotland Act affect bail in Scottish courts? I would be happy with a standard grade explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, on page 12, paragraph 1 of schedule 3 makes changes to the Fire Services Act 1947. Again, I may have missed something. New section 24(a) of the 1947 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Her Majesty may appoint a Chief Inspector of Fire Services for Scotland and Inspectors of Fire Services in Scotland".</p></blockquote>
I know that Her Majesty does not appoint those people; they are appointed by the United Kingdom Government or by the Scottish Parliament. I should be somewhat concerned if the UK Government were to appoint the Chief Inspector of Fire Services for Scotland. It may be in the Scotland Act, but I would like to know who appoints the chief inspector. Other than that, I cannot find anything to object to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Pentlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, in response to the hon. Member for West Dorset, I should say that if a constitutional problem is well founded in law, the usual challenge will be available through judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I wish to raise a fairly technical matter, and the Minister may wish to write to me at some length; it is a matter of considerable interest to me because of my membership of the Select Committee on Public Administration. I note that paragraph 5 of schedule 1 refers to the role of the Parliamentary Commissioner. My understanding was that the commissioner would have no jurisdiction over the Scottish Executive or the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. I would be grateful if that could be confirmed. I raise the point because of the provision in paragraph 26, in part II of schedule 1, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a database is made by or under the direction of control of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body shall be regarded as the maker of the database."</p></blockquote>
I am interested that the information commissioner, who is given a role in the Data Protection Act, would have some jurisdiction, because the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the maker of the database would normally, unless there are other provisions, have all the databases for the Scottish Parliament. How is it envisaged that the two UK commissioners will have jurisdiction under the two Acts in relation to devolved and undevolved matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.51 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin with the point of principle raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset. I take account of his point, which was non-partisan: he was addressing the previous and the present Government. The Scotland Act has a huge effect on a wide range of matters and makes some changes that are required as a consequence of other legislation. An enormous raft of changes were necessary, but the changes were purely technical, following on from the principles embodied in the Scotland Act. It would not have been practical to have made all the changes in the Scotland Act itself and the order is probably—although the hon. Gentleman does not agree—the best way of doing so. The changes are being made by affirmative resolution, which all sides of the House agreed was the appropriate way of dealing with technical changes that have an impact on primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that the previous Lord Advocate has been kept informed of the various kinds of consequential changes that were considered necessary. Information was made available through the usual channels about the amendments before we reached that stage so that people's concerns could be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not in the least doubt the hon. Gentleman's sincerity on that; as long as Governments use order-making powers only for genuinely technical amendments, there is no problem. However, does he agree that we are setting a dreadful precedent in that a future Government—of any party—could decide not to make technical errors? That could escape the notice of the House or, if it were picked up, present it with the choice of throwing out the order or accepting it wholesale-which is no way to deal with a point of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could be said of both the previous Government and this one. We do deal with issues of substance in such Committees. To get back to the order,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
it is heavily technical and does not change any issues of substance. It merely follows through the consequences of what was agreed as part of the Scotland Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the individual points that were mentioned. The hon. Member for West Dorset was concerned about the sort of help that would be available for people of modest means who wish to pursue a case up to the level of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The order will make such people eligible for legal aid, as would be the case for usual court procedure in Scotland. Matters will be brought to the Judicial Committee within the scope of the legal aid system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not terribly well up on the Lord Chancellor's proposals because they affect England and Wales rather than Scotland. They are not relevant to this order or what will happen in Scotland. The legal aid provisions in Scotland, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Dr. Clark) said, will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament to decide. I imagine that future changes will have to take account of the possibility of devolution issues and will have to be pursued through to the level of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful and clarifies the Government's intention. To take it a stage further, if an English or Welsh person had a case to bring to the Privy Council relating to a concordat between the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament, would that person be entitled to legal aid to pursue such a case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who is pursuing a case through the Scottish courts would be similarly eligible for all the aid and protection that is available within the Scottish courts and which is within the scope of the law, as set down by the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Eleanor Laing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Epping Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My concern, as ever, is for Scottish and other UK taxpayers at a time when the Government's aim is, rightly, to reduce the legal aid bill for the whole country. Has the Minister assessed the likely cost to taxpayers of extending legal aid to this new area of law? I have always said—I am allowed to do so because I am a Scottish solicitor—that the only people who will benefit from the Scotland Act are Scottish solicitors who will make a lot of money from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not made a precise assessment, but I should imagine that it will be a small amount. As the hon. Member for West Dorset said, issues going to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will involve mainly large bodies and organisations. It would be rare for individuals to bring cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on a dispute over whether a certain law was an appropriate one to have passed in Scotland because it was a devolved or reserved matter. That would happen only in exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can imagine an individual pursuing a civil or criminal matter through the Scottish courts, and part of the the argument being whether the law was appropriate for the Scottish Parliament to have passed or whether it should have been subject to a reserved power. A case could be pursued by an individual all the way to the Judicial Committee, although such instances would be rare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will remember that, under the Scotland Act, there is no question of having to go up the chain to get to the Judicial Committee. All devolution issues are referred immediately to the Committee. Will it not fulfil the same role as the European Court of Justice plays in European law issues, when other courts will have to refer matters to the Judicial Committee as soon as the question whether they are devolutionary issues is raised? Will people not use the system as they started to use the ECJ and European law, in general, to challenge decisions that would otherwise go against them? There may be a flood of such litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is more likely that issues in which legal aid applied would be proceedings that had already been through the courts in which one of the points at issue was whether the matter concerned devolution. The number of cases that incurred liability for legal aid would be limited. All such matters will become clearer in time, but that is the expected position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful for the hon. Gentleman to know that devolution issues will generally go from the law courts to the Court of Session or to the High Court, in the first instance. It will be up to the Law Officers to decide whether it is appropriate for the case to go direct to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; such procedure is not automatic—point that deals also with the potential cost to the legal aid budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify an issue on page 12 of the order that relates to section 2 of the Abortion Act 1967 and also paragraph 5 on page 13? Powers relating to abortion are reserved for the Westminster Parliament. The two statements in the order imply that the section of the Act under which the abortion legislation is to be administered and the 1991 regulations are to be transferred from the Scottish Office to the new Scottish Administration. Will the Minister clarify the position, given that the new Scottish Administration will not have powers governing abortion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Scottish Parliament will not have such powers and abortion is a reserved matter, the order will not change that. Obviously, certain officers of the Scottish Assembly will have to carry out requirements under the abortion laws and have to apply the legislation appropriately as it applies throughout the United Kingdom. The order defines the particular officers who will have to fulfil such obligations. The officers already have those obligations. All that is being changed is the Officers' title, not their duties. The hon. Lady was concerned about that point, but those duties will remain under UK legislation—they are covered by a reserved rather than a devolved power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fire inspectors were mentioned. They will be appointed by Her Majesty on the advice of the First Minister. There is no change, except that the First Minister rather than the Secretary of State will provide the advice. The reference to bail is in parallel to that for legal aid. Provision for bail and legal aid, which would usually be available to people in the Scottish courts, will be available when cases go to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Data protection will be a reserved power and in parallel with the abortion provisions. Officers and bodies in Scotland will have to fulfil their obligations to the Westminster Parliament under legislation that is reserved at a UK level. The order is designed to ensure that that can happen. I recognise that data protection is of particular interest to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands. I shall write to her setting out the overall picture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why has the definition of "pre-commencement enactment" been modified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have to write to the hon. Gentleman about that. If he will allow me to do so, it may be to the satisfaction of the whole Committee. I hope that the Committee can approve the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
