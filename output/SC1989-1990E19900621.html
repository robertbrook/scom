	<p>Amendment proposed [19 June]: No. 166, in page 57, line 3, leave out from "site" to end of line 6 and insert—

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have two announcements to make. First, it appears that there are likely to be several Divisions in the Chamber at 7 pm, so I propose that we adjourn at 7 pm for the normal one and a half hour dinner break.

Secondly, amendments Nos. 175 and 177 have been withdrawn. Therefore, with amendment No. 166, we may take the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol>
and Government amendment No. 241.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:We are in danger of making heavy weather of the clause and must try to make some progress. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) for his comments in our previous sitting. The Financial Secretary said that he wanted to hear what hon. Members felt about the clause before he replied. I wonder whether he has heard sufficient to be able to give us some crisp and succinct explanations of the Government's reasons for drafting the clause. Perhaps he would also say whether the Government are satis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
fied that the word "site" is defined accurately enough. We want to prevent legal problems arising—waste management companies asking for tax concessions on the basis of the questionable division of a site into more than one site, or the reverse. In the hope that we can make progress this afternoon, I shall sit down straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) wishes me to comment on the clause rather than the Government amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Order. Perhaps it would be convenient for me to intervene here. My fellow Chairman, Mr. Coleman, told me that there was a somewhat extended discussion on the clause in our previous sitting, so we have decided that it would be wholly inappropriate to have a clause stand part debate. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take advantage of the invitation proferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Indeed I intend to do that. I merely wished to be precise in order to be helpful. I believe that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) wished me to comment on the purpose of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:No doubt we can consider the other amendments, but a quick description of the clause would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that the clause introduces a new basis for tax relief for expenditure on preparing and making good landfill sites for waste disposal. For restoration payments, the full amount of the payment will be allowed in the year in which it is made. Relief for expenditure on preparing a site will be spread over the lifetime of a site in proportion to the site capacity used up in any year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are introducing this relief to restore what seems to have been the status quo in practice and to clarify and regularise the position, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste Management Ltd. The purpose is not to alter the treatment of what has become referred to in the Committee as airspace, which is a separate issue for which we did not believe we should give a separate relief. However, we thought it appropriate to give relief for restoration and preparation payments. We believe that has the general support of the Committee on environmental grounds. Where such payments are required under the terms of licence, they should be an allowable expense for relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Government amendments, some of which we have already discussed and others that we are now discussing or are about to discuss, are intended to clarify this matter, because the licensing arrangements will alter slightly. Furthermore, before the new regime of licences, there was some ambiguity about the period in which the relief, as against the licence, was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several amendments tabled by the Opposition and by my hon. Friends were in tune with the Government's recognition of the need to improve the clause. I hope that our amendments meet the spirit of theirs. I think that Government amendments Nos. 166,168 and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
241 render unnecessary amendment No. 78, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and amendment No. 208, which was tabled by the Opposition. As a Government amendment will delete the words to which their amendments relate, they are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have been handed a piece of paper about the definition of a site being reasonably watertight. Is there any chance of a waste disposal company creating difficulties through the legal system by redefining "site"? I should like the Ministers assurance on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:We are reasonably confident that no difficulties will arise. None has been pointed out to us on a clause that has attracted more amendments than any other. We think that the definition is tight enough and that there should be no difficulty in practice because licences are built into the terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for what the Minister has said, but I should like to explore the issue a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister said that the clause is intended to restore the situation to what it was before Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste Management Ltd. but it, and Government amendment No. 166, take the situation back to what it was before that court case. Will the Minister elucidate that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be helpful if the Minister could put a value on the concessions made in the clause and the Government amendments to it. Thirdly, it appears that amendment No. 166 would allow payments to be made, or reliefs to be given, not when a site was restored, but while it was still working, because Government amendment No. 166 would allow reliefs to be given on part of a site. That means that part of a site could continue to be used for waste disposal while another part would attract the benefit of tax allowance reliefs because of partial restoration. That difficult situation needs to be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, throughout our debate, we have referred to "site", but the clause goes further. It seems that something more than "site" is at stake, as transfer stations and incinerators would be covered by the clause. Of the 330 incinerators in the country, only 35 are municipally owned. The other 295, including some controversial facilities, would appear to be the beneficiaries of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my questions are to the point and about the facts. If it is impossible for me to receive an instataneous reply, I shall be happy to receive a reply in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Member is always commendably succinct; I shall endeavour to reply equally succinctly. He asks whether the clause goes beyond the Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste Management Ltd. case. Yes, because before that case, the position was uncertain. We are establishing a sensible and comprehensive basis for the future, by rationalising treatment of preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about costs, which I estimate to be about £5 million this year and £10 mil-
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
lion next year. He also asked whether relief would be given whilst sites and incinerators are still in use. I shall have to look more closely into that and write to him more fully later. I have one such site in my constituency, so I shall welcome the information that he has induced me to elicit. I shall examine Hansard carefully; if I have missed any of his points, I shall respond later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The amendment seeks to encourage waste disposal companies to look for sites. The clause could debar such companies from having tax relief in their preparatory work—perhaps two years before their licence is granted. The amendment attempts to rectify that deficiency, giving a company leeway for two years to prospect and survey potential sites. If such preparatory work were done within two years, it would be tax deductible. It is a straightforward amendment which I commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The amendment commends itself to the Government. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that Government amendment No. 170 deals effectively with the same problem. It achieves much the same object as amendment No. 200, albeit in a slightly different way, by specifying that the licence must be held at the time when waste is first deposited on the site. We believe that that is a more precise way to achieve the same objective that the hon. Gentleman seeks. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Since the Bill was published, it has become apparent that, as drafted, it does not achieve the right result in some limited circumstances in relation to expenditure incurred before 5 April 1989. If disposal operations at a site ceased after 5 April 1989 but before the start of a period of account ending after 5 April 1990, no relief would be due for any of the preparatory expenditure on that site, even though some of that expenditure related to site capacity used for waste disposal after 5 April 1989.

I have waited a long time to move this amendment, but the spirit of the afternoon is such that I should not take overlong to move it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has often been said in our debate on this clause, we are attempting to restore the position that existed before the decision in the case of Rolfe v. Wimpey Waste Management Ltd. in April 1989. The amendment seeks to go further than simply returning to the status quo. The clause should cover waste storage as well as disposal sites. Many sheds and dumps are used for waste, which is in transit until it reaches its final place of disposal. Such places can be as polluted as a final disposal site, and leakages can occur. They will need to be restored before they can be used for other purposes. The clause is not a green revolution. Amendment No. 99, does not claim to be, either, but it might encourage polluters to clear up after themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The clause will restore the position that existed before the Wimpey decisions, which did not alter the treatment of expenditure on storage sites.

I am happy to move the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) because I support it. When the Committee discussed clause 47, my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said that the Opposition would support it. The amendment is unexceptional—it simply seeks to ensure that investment trust companies are covered by clause 70. How far does the Financial Secretary believe that pension funds should go in trading in futures and options? It is acceptable that such funds hedge their portfolios to achieve a balance, but some pension funds go further, and trade aggressively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The underlying clause allows pension funds to receive appropriate tax treatment so that they are no longer precluded from using futures and options more widely. That will be beneficial. Pension funds are restricted, by regulatory means, in the way that they invest pensioners' money. That is a more appropriate method of ensuring that they are prudently operated than the tax system. It is desirable that a number of institutions deal in futures and options so that the market is broad and deep and remains in this country. No one wants any institution to abuse its freedom, but that is a matter for the regulatory, rather than the fiscal, authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13, moved in a generous bipartisan gesture by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), would exclude profits from transactions made in futures and options by investment trusts from any charge to tax as trading income. I fear that it would go further than is intended by either my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) or the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East. The amendment reflects unease over existing involvements by investment trusts in shares and securities, but it is not confined to them. Companies which are generaly accepted as dealers in futures and options but which have no investments in shares and securities would not be prevented from trying to adopt investment trust status to secure exemption from tax on dealing income from derivatives. Such companies would not resemble the normal conception of investment trust, but they could secure that status merely by having a small income from shares and securities. Their dealing in futures and options would be ignored. No regulatory constraints exist to stop that happening. Investment trusts are not subject to restrictions similar to those faced by authorised unit trusts on the use of futures and options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise that the Opposition and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood want investment trusts to be free, I explained in an earlier response that we believe that their freedom under the existing arrangements is sufficient to enable them to be involved in futures and options. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Financial Secretary spoke about the need to establish what he called a "broad and deep market" in futures and options, to be located in London. That almost tempts the Committee to regard the clause as tantamount to an industrial subsidy to the financial services industry. That concept gives me pause for thought, and shows the clause in a new light. Will the Minister say what value he places on the concessions which the clause grants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Costing the tax relief forgone is very difficult. My best guess is that it would be negligible, because such dealing by the pension funds would be limited and there would be little taxable income. The normal way of assessing that cost is by applying the tax added or rate forgone to the existing income, rather than by taking into account the behavioural effects which would not have occurred if the change had not been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am not entirely satisfied with that answer. The Minister gave his reply very quickly and I tried to understand it. Is he saying that the clause will help to establish a "broad and deep" market in London, yet will have a negligible tax impact? If the financial impact is to be negligible, how can he expect a significant change in the behaviour of the pension funds participating in the futures and options market? As the aim of the clause is to secure some behavioural change, surely it must have a financial impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has given me the chance to clarify my thoughts. Normally, the cost of a tax relief is measured by the tax currently yielded. The cost of the removal of a tax is the income that is forgone. As very little trading is carried out under the current tax regime—although if such trading were carried out it would be liable to tax—there is very little income to be forgone. As a result of removing this disincentive, there will presumably be greater activity but no loss to the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The aim of proposed section 136A (3)(c) seems to be to allow relief only if the debtor and creditor have always been on arm's length terms. To achieve that, it would be appropriate to amend the provision to include cases in which debtor and creditor are associated. That is what the amendment would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) suggests, the main reason for denying the relief when borrower and lender are in the same group is that the group has overall suffered no commercial loss: all the making of the loan has done is to transfer funds from one pocket of the group to another. The position, however, is not quite the same for associated companies, which have a somewhat more distant relationship with each other and are not so financially interdependent. We believe, therefore, that the right place to draw the line is for companies in group relationship and that to deny the new relief for associated companies would be going too far and would cut out genuine commercial losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

New section 136A(1l)(b) contains wording in brackets which we find diffiuclt to understand. It seems to cover cases in which several successive claims have been made as a debt becomes progressively less recoverable. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment as a friendly attempt to cover the same cases, using more comprehensive and comprehensible wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Any amendment that clarifies wording is, in my view, an extremely friendly gesture. However, there are situations where relief may be allowed more than once in respect of the same bond. For example, in the case of a bond with an underlying loan of £1,000, immediately after the redemption date the lender can establish that £100 is irrecoverable and make a claim for £100 relief. A bit later, it transpires that another £500 is irrecoverable and a second claim is made. In total, relief has been given on £600 but on two separate occasions. Amendment No. 231, would not work in those circumstances, because its wording presupposes that relief will be given on only one occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of new section 136A(11)(b) caters for the situation by setting out a rule under which the relevant outstanding amount is determined by adding up the total sums which have attracted relief. To cope with the eventuality of multiple relief, the wording must be complex. Regrettably, the wording in the amendment would not have the same effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:As the hon. Gentleman recognised, the amendments seek to disapply, for the purposes of group income, rules which clause 74 disapplies for the purpose of capital gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important anti-avoidance provisions to counter attempts to exploit the "group income" rules by means of artificial arrangements to gain an objectionable tax advantage. Under these "group income" rules, dividends and other distributions can pass between a subsidiary and its parent without advance corporation tax having to be accounted for. These anti-avoidance provisions are necessary to prevent the loss of what might be a very large amount of tax. They are designed to ensure that the benefit of the group income rules is not available where, in commercial terms, two companies are not, or are no longer, in group relationship, but in legal terms they are both group members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to relax the equivalent provisions for capital gains in certain ways, as proposed in clause 74, because there are additional rules which impose a capital gains charge when a company actually leaves a group. There is no equivalent "degrouping" charge for group income and, given the different nature of a disposal of a capital asset and the way income arises, it

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:My understanding is that an inadvertent error was made when provisions on groups of companies were consolidated in schedule 18 of the Taxes Act 1988. Schedule 18 lays down tests for when one company should be regarded as having an interest in another company and, to what extent, for group relief purposes. To avoid repetition, the same schedule was incorporated into the group of companies legislation by reference. However, small changes had to be made to the schedule to cope with matters solely referrable to group relief. One of those was not made, so a matter that was designed to off-set solely group relief also affected the group of companies rules. Clause 74 would remove that with retrospective effect. Will the Financial Secretary comment on the retrospective effect of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman's broad understanding is right, but errors are attributable to Ministers; draftsmen make drafting amendments that improve matters. Generally, it is accepted, in principle, that changes in the law should take effect form the date of announcement. In this case, a very small category of companies might be disadvantaged by an unintended effect of last year's reforms. In such circumstances, retrospection can be justified: it is a beneficial and relieving form of retrospection. In those circumstances, I hope that it is acceptable to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>:The new sections implement the recommendations of the committee chaired by Lord Keith on the enforcement powers of the Revenue. The committee found that enforcement powers were out of date and ill-suited to current requirements. Lord Keith proposed improved and more coherent powers, coupled with the necessaary checks and balances to ensure that taxpayers' legitimate rights were not infringed. These new sections take account of those considerations. It is right that the Revenue has adequate powers to collect tax that is properly due; if it does not, all honest taxpayers suffer, as they have to pay more tax to make up for the shortfall from those who do not pay. But it is right also that the Revenue should not abuse that position of trust and place unreasonable obligations or burdens on taxpayers. The new sections would maintain a balance between those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 211 and 158, tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) respectively, would reinstate the wording in section 8 that requires the return to be a return of income computed in accordance with the Taxes Acts. That would defeat all the objectives of the clause. The existing wording, which my hon. Friends wish to retain, is unsatisfactory. Personal tax returns do not call for details of income computed in accordance with the Taxes Acts. In vari-
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
ous respects, the taxpayer is asked for simpler information and the Revenue does the rest of the computations for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore clearly right to remove those misleading and outdated words from the legislation. In updating the rules, we have followed the same approach we have already taken for company tax returns under pay and file.

	<div class='membercontribution'>:I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Perhaps I can deal with it when elaborating on his

	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
general contention. I believe his fear is that the new sections give the inspector wide powers to ask for any information that he choose. He said that there is therefore some anxiety about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are concerned with the standard tax returns sent out to millions of taxpayers to complete each year. The new sections do not give the local inspector any power to decide what information the taxpayer may be required to provided in his return. The responsibility for deciding what information may be required in the return is placed firmly with the Board of Inland Revenue by other provisions in the Taxes Management Act 1970. The tax return forms and the information that may be required have to be approved by the Board of Inland Revenue before they are brought into use. The only power given to the local inspector by these provisions is to decide which taxpayers should be sent returns to complete. In practice, even those powers are exercised in accordance with instructions from the headquarters of the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Is my hon. Friend therefore saying that these words on personal tax returns—and which exist in clause 78 in relation to corporation tax returns—are unnecessary because the inspector has more discretion on corporation tax, but none at all in the case of personal tax, which is all tied up by the board? It seems to me that, while the words may be unnecessary, they would be reassuring. Therefore, if they would not place any restrictions on the inspector, why do we not include them anyway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The differences in wording of personal tax returns and company tax returns are deliberate and reflect differences in information that may be required. Personal tax returns call for the information that is needed to ensure that the person pays the right amount of income tax. That is the effect of the opening words in the personal tax sections about assessing a person for income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording used in the next clause for company tax returns is deliberately wider in scope because the information that the Revenue needs in company tax returns goes wider than what is needed to assess the company's corporation tax. For example the Revenue needs details of amounts surrendered as group relief to other companies—information about corporation tax liabilities of companies claiming group relief rather than the company making the return. The wider wording used in the next clause is thus designed to describe accurately and precisely the purpose of the company tax return and information which may therefore be required in or with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another question, which concerns whether the measures allow the Revenue to require the taxpayer to make up his accounts in a specified form. The new rules give the Revenue the powers needed to encourage smaller taxpayers to use a three-line account rather than prepare more detailed accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Revenue should prescribe the form and content of the detail of accounts of the self-employed was examined by the Keith committee, and in the consultations that followed the Government announced in 1988 that there were no proposals for the Revenue to lay down any requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the proposed new section 9(2) allows an inspector to issue notices to a partner to require
	<br><blockquote><p>"such person as is identified in accordance with rules given with the notice"</p></blockquote>
to complete a partnership tax return. The existing section 9 lays down precise rules on who must complete the return. Amendment No. 233 would make that general power less wide by compelling the Revenue to publish regulations on who will be required to complete the partnership returns and to stick to those regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) has explained, amendment No. 233 deals with the rules for partnership returns. The proposed new section provides that the rules on who should make the return are to be specified in the tax return form. That is a simplifying measure. The present statutory rules are difficult to understand. The simplified rules given with the tax return do not correspond exactly with the statutory rules that, in strict law, should be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed change would replace the complicated statutory rules with simplified rules in the return. The Revenue has no plans to change those rules. The amendment would require the rules to be laid in regulations. That would frustrate the purpose of the change, which is to replace rules in strict statutory language that are inflexible and difficult to understand with simple rules written in everyday language on the tax return form.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Our amendments would get at the situation where the declaration on the tax return is not as comprehensive as it should be. A partnership or company return differs from a return submitted by an individual in that the signatory in the latter case must

	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
include data of which he or she may have not first-hand knowledge. The existing rule is that the signatory must declare that the return is correct and complete to the "best of his knowledge", but a signatory could deliberately restrict his knowledge so as to be technically correct in signing the return while not being as open and honest as he might be. That might apply where a company or partnership was sailing close to the wind. The amendment seeks to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to complete returns fully and accurately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:These amendments are about the declaration on personal and company tax returns. The taxpayer has to sign a declaration that the return is correct and complete to the best of his or her knowledge. The amendments seek to add a declaration that the taxpayer has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the return is correct and complete, but it is unclear whether the amendments are intended to give further protection to the taxpayer or the Exchequer. In practice, they would do neither and would cause many ordinary taxpayers a lot of unnecessary worry and distress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would not do anything to protect the Exchequer from tax evasion and avoidance, yet that is their very purpose. The hon. Gentleman is trying to ensure that evasion and avoidance are stamped out, but the amendments are unnecessary to achieve that. The clause is sufficient to close off any loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Determined evaders and avoiders would not have any qualms about making this further declaration, in addition to the declaration that they are already making that the returns are correct and complete— especially since the penalties if they were found out would be precisely the same whichever form of declaration were used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are also unnecessary if they are intended to protect the taxpayer from being penalised for innocent errors where he has taken reasonable steps to ensure that his return is correct and complete, but they would cause many ordinary taxpayers, especially those without professional advisers, a great deal of worry and distress about what reasonable steps they should take and what penalties await them if they fail to do so. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Economic Secretary is right about the motives for tabling the amendments.

The Minister has already argued that the penalties are similar whether the return is statutory or non-statutory.

The present rules demand a declaration to the effect that the return is correct and complete. The corresponding provision for personal tax returns includes the important qualification that the declaration is made to the best of the person's knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representative bodies suggested that the statutory rules about company tax returns should be brought into line with the personal taxation return rules. We were happy to do so. The company tax return form has already been altered to include those important words. Clause 78 will bring the statutory rules into line as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals primarily, and will come into effect, with the new company tax returns in pay and file. My hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, pay and file has been the subject of extensive consultations. The basic scheme was worked out in consultation with bodies representing the legal and accountancy professions and the main framework was set out in the Finance Act 1987. The detail of the scheme has continued to be worked on in consultation with a joint working group from the Inland Revenue and the representative bodies. Measures in this year's Finance Bill, including the clause, cover further improvements that the joint working group believe to be necessary for the smooth and efficient working of pay and file.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment put back words that have been found wanting by the Inland Revenue, after consultation with interest groups, and remove new words that are needed. That would allow the Revenue to obtain information in the return that the representative bodies mainain it should not be able to require, while preventing the Revenue from obtaining information that the representative bodies agree is needed for the operation of pay and file. In view of the other changes made by the clause, the amendment would remove most of the information from the pay and file return, including all the details of tax payable and repayable, which are crucial to the operation of pay and file.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 213 seeks to restrict reports that may be required with the return to those that must be prepared under the Companies Act, 1989. I sympathise with the amendment, but it would destroy part of the pay and file return. As my hon. Friend correctly surmises, the reports to which the clause refers, and which are to be delivered with the return, are mainly—but not exclusively—those that are required by the Companies Act 1989, especially those accounts which comply with the Inland Revenue's wish that they include the directors' and auditors' report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure my hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"; (c) the amount of any allowable losses accruing in an accounting period available to be deducted from chargeable gains accruing to the company in subsequent accounting periods;</p></blockquote>

The amendment would widen the scope of the determination procedure. Under pay and file, a company needs to be able to evaluate its tax position at the previous year-end even more than its current position. Would not the Government find acceptable an extension to the determination system that would help companies do that, as long as it did not place undue pressure on inspectors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The new determination procedure is designed as part of the mechanism for dealing with groups of companies under pay and file, by allowing the profits and losses available for group relief to be agreed across the group. The amendment would extend the determination procedure so that it was used for a quite different purpose. It would require the inspector to agree formally with the company various figures relating to amounts carried forward for corporation tax purposes to subsequent accounting periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important question of balance to be considered between the interests of the taxpayer and
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
the costs of administering the tax system for both the taxpayer and the Revenue. The new procedures are designed to simplify and streamline the administration of the tax system. Determining trading losses and other amounts available for relief makes it simpler and more straightforward to agree the tax liabilities of companies across a group for the same accounting period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require various amounts which were carried forward to be agreed in the same way. There are no corresponding overall benefits to be gained in this way. The amendment would not simplify or streamline the agreement of the tax liabilities for these companies. Instead, it would add a further layer of administration before the liabilities were agreed which would increase the costs of administration for the taxpayer and the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there are advantages for taxpayers where amounts to be carried forward can be agreed, as that gives the taxpayer greater certainty over his tax affairs. But there can also be considerable disadvantages to both the taxpayer and the Revenue where figures cannot be agreed between two groups. In some cases, the Revenue and the taxpayer would be involved in complex and costly negotiations and possibly litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In various circumstances, the amounts carried forward can be changed by events in later years and would then have to be renegotiated. In many cases, the amounts carried forward will never become material for tax purposes, so the additional burden on the Revenue and the taxpayer of determining those amounts would be wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, I believe that the administrative costs that would result from requiring amounts which are carried forward to be formally agreed outweigh the limited benefits for some taxpayers. It is better to continue as in the past, by allowing amounts to be agreed informally where appropriate, leaving amounts in other circumstances, particularly amounts which cannot be agreed, to be hammered out if and when they become material for tax purposes.

	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 190 and Government new clause 24—Group relief: relieved losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Perhaps I should explain the purpose of the amendments. The new rules about claims to group relief under pay and file proposed in schedule 12 are intended to allow a company to make and vary claims to group relief up until the profits of the company are finally agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also propose changes in clause 84 to the rules for loss relief under pay and file, to remove the need for a claim to be made before trading losses can be relieved against the profits of a later period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we included a rule in schedule 12 allowing a company to reallocate trading losses for which relief has been given against the profits of a later period automatically, without a claim, so as to allow the losses to be surrendered as group relief, but we made this subject to a two-year time limit which was based on the present time limit for making claims to group relief.
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
Representatives of the various professions including the accountancy profession—represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley)—pointed out that this would be more restrictive than the present rules which, in practice, allow decisions on the allocation of trading losses to be made outside this time limit. Therefore, we propose in amendments and new clause 24 to remove the two-year time limit on reallocation. The effect is broadly to allow companies the same freedom to decide how trading losses should be relieved as they enjoy at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 190, in page 143, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) Where consent to surrender relates to a loss in respect of which relief has been given under section 393(1). notice of consent to surrender, in the case of the surrendering company, shall be of no effect unless. at the same time as giving the notice to the inspector, the company amends its return under section 11 of the Management Act for the period, or. if more than one, each of the periods, in which relief for the loss has been given under section 393(1).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5B) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (5A) above relief under section 393(1) shall be treated as given for losses incurred in earlier accounting periods before losses incurred in later accounting periods.".—[Mr. Ryder.]</p></blockquote></p>

	<div class='title'>CORPORATION TAX: COLLECTION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 73, line 44, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided always that if no actual assessment for the accounting period first above mentioned has been made within six years of the end of the said accounting period any corporation tax paid by the company in relation to the said accounting period shall forthwith be repaid to it".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 239, in page 73, line 44, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that this subsection shall not apply where an assessment to corporation tax on the company has been made for the accounting period in question at the time the amount referred to above would otherwise have become due and payable".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:The amendment provides that where, under the new pay and file system of corporation tax, a company has paid tax over to Revenue but no official assessment has been made on it by the Revenue within the normal six-year limit, the Revenue must repay the tax to the taxpayer. Under the present law, companies do not pay tax to the Revenue until an official assessment has been made on them. Under the proposed new pay and file system, companies have to pay tax to the Revenue automatically on the due date without a formal assessment having been made. I understand that the Revenue has stated that, as corporation tax is an assessed tax, even under the pay and file system it must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
make an assessment within six years or the tax paid by the company has to be repaid. It is not easy to find in the Taxes Act 1988 the appropriate mechanism that would achieve that result. If my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary believes that the amendment is not needed, will he point to the existing statutory provision that has the same effect as the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:We fear that the clause could have substantial implications for some taxpayers—not least, that they could end up having to pay the same tax twice. Under the current law, if tax is eventually found to be due for an accounting period but—usually for good reasons—was inadequately assessed, or assessed and postponed, interest on that tax is charged only from six months after the due and payable date. Under pay and file, it may be charged from the due and payable date. The purpose of our amendment is to perserve the existing system—that is, to deal with our second point as well as with our fear that some people could end up paying tax twice. Will the Economic Secretary respond to both concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryder</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:If I may, I shall respond first to amendment No. 216, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingtoke (Mr. Hunter). As he said assessments will be made when they are needed under pay and file. The inspector is required to make an assessment once the profits have been agreed. In most cases, an assessment will not be made until then, but assessments will be made earlier when it is necessary to do so—for example, to allow either party to take an appeal to the commissioners or to counter delay by the taxpayer. Where the profits had not been agreed within six years, which is the usual time limit for making an assessment, a protective assessment would generally be made. The amendment would provide that, if a protective assessment were not made, corporation tax paid by the company should be repaid to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary as that process would usually follow automatically when an assessment was not made. In some circumstances, the Revenue can make an assessment, outside the six-year time limit, when tax has been lost through fraud or neglect by the company. In those cases, it would be wrong to repay corporation tax that had been paid by the Company before the extended time limit assessment had been made and the figures agreed. For that reason, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would not press his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) tabled amendment No. 239. Pay and file
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
does away with the need for assessment before corporation tax becomes due and payable. Under pay and file, corporation tax will become due and payable nine months after the end of the accounting period. A company is required to send its tax returns to the inspector within 12 months after the end of the accounting period. The tax return for pay and file will include the company's own computation of how much tax it should pay and this tax should be paid already. When it has not been paid already, the clause allows the Revenue to collect the amount that the company shows that it should pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would displace that rule when an assessment has been made on a company. Again, that is unnecessary, as that is already the effect of the proposed rule. The new procedure works by treating the amount shown in the return as being due under a deemed assessment for the period. When an actual assessment is made, that automatically displaces the deemed assessment and the usual rules for collecting tax under the assessment then apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would be largely ineffective because it is restricted—I am sure that that restriction is inadvertent—to assessments made before the tax becomes due and payable, before nine months after the end of the accounting period. Assessments will rarely be made before that date under pay and file. When they are, the usual rules for collecting tax under assessment, rather than the new rule about collecting the tax shown as due by the return, will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked whether people could pay twice. When tax is paid already, there will be no additional liability under the assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
