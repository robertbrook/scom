	<div class='bill'>TRANSPORT BILL</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>The Minister of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Transport Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
This is an important Bill and I am sure that the Committee will want to scrutinise it carefully, but I am also sure that the Committee will want to make good progress with our discussions. I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill. It is our custom to meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as is proposed in the sittings motion, and I believe that that will be the most convenient way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the sittings motion can be agreed and that we shall be able to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pleasant indeed to be able to begin on a note of agreement with the Minister on what is, as he rightly says, a very important Bill but, a very controversial Bill. It is also, of course, pleasant to note that the Minister agrees that we want to have a very detailed discussion of the Bill and we will come to some of the difficulties in doing that arising from the Minister's actions a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Minister will appreciate that the rare, if not unique, construction of the Bill, particularly in its most amazing first clause, poses difficulties in doing what he is suggesting and he will, I hope, be prepared to facilitate us in meeting the aims which he has defined by having a detailed discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is most important, therefore, that the Minister should be present with us for those sittings when we are examining this unique clause. I understand, of course, that since he has to be in Cabinet on Thursday mornings that would place a restriction on our ability to comply with the terms of the sittings motion. Of course, I realise that we would not want to hold up the Bill unduly on that account, but at least for the first of our two sittings when we discuss clause 1 it would be eminently reasonable that the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
should be with us. Therefore, I should like to move, at the appropriate time, an amendment to the sittings motion to achieve that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing so, I must point out that before we reach the subsequent clauses it will be necessary for the Opposition to receive the views of a number of important bodies of people affected by the Bill. We have not been able to do that because of the way in which the Minister has operated on this clause. For example, as soon as we received the Bill my hon. Friends and I set about contacting the local authorities, the unions, the employers, and in particular, the bus company employees, affected by the early provisions of the Bill. We found them as unaware as we were of some of the provisions and they are still examining these with a view to advising us on the matter. It seems to me that I, and my hon. Friends, rather than having a happy yuletide will be spending most of our Christmas Recess in discussions and communications with some of these bodies in order to equip ourselves to do the job which we should have been well-prepared to do if the Minister had indicated clearly, as is normally the case on a controversial measure, the scope that he was envisaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find to my deep concern that a number of issues raised in the Bill have not been covered by the consultative document. An outstanding case is the provision of an appeal against the refusal by the London Transport Executive to reach an agreement. I suggest that somebody involved in the drafting of the Bill has overlooked that because it is not even mentioned as one of the purposes of the Bill in clause 1, which purports to outline the purposes of part I. The discussion document, incidentally, has misled a number of interested parties including myself in that it said that the fare and distance would be the basis for defining the limits of the road service licence. No such restriction of fare limits is indicated in the Bill. The discussions which we conducted before publication of the Bill on that basis have been largely a waste of time and will have to be repeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had other difficulties in that there was no indication in the consultative document of the major change in contract carriage provision. That, again, is a matter which seems not to have been understood by the Minister, judging by his interventions on Second Reading. It is certainly a matter which now, having been drawn to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the attention of some of those affected, is causing very considerable alarm and must be the basis of consultation which we should naturally want to complete before discussing those parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally we have been misled in the consultative document in that it clearly outlined the intention of the Minister to lay a Bill which would prepare for the introduction of EEC rules as from 1 January 1983. We can find no provision within the Bill which relates to that. Therefore it seems that we must on this occasion very regretfully—because nobody is keener than we are to debate some of the basic issues and to ascertain what some of them are in the Bill—I conduct a discussion with the Minister as to his purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been the only ones facing this difficulty in the House. Our Library assistants, who serve us so well in stating in a fair and impartial way the provisions of Bills for those Ministers who are interested, prepared a document on the Transport Bill, Ref 79/11 dated 20 November. Its authors say
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will not be possible to work out the exact implications of the changes in the law for some time."</p></blockquote>
—I can only agree heartily with them and regret that we should have to consider the Bill when its legislative implications cannot be worked out without very detailed discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will therefore be my intention before we reach a decision on the sittings motion to move an amendment to provide that we sit on days when the Minister can be present until we have completed our discussions on clause 1. I hope that we can then proceed, taking proper account of the Minister's need to attend Cabinet meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support my right hon. Friend in his submission about the sittings motion. My right hon. Friend has made a valid point—a point on which we have not yet heard from the Minister who has not had an opportunity to reply—that the right hon. Gentleman has to be in Cabinet. This is a matter for discussion, presumably, between my right hon. Friend and the Minister, about the difficulties he faces with his job. If that is the case, clearly there will be difficulties, certainly in the early stages of the Bill in understanding and clarifying all aspects, particularly in the part dealing with express carriages,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
and the redefinition of public vehicles. On Second Reading we said that the complexity of the changes is, as the Minister agreed fundamental and radical and therefore have considerable implications. It is here that we are placed in considerable difficulty. If the Bill were dealing with something that was familiar to us, we could willingly put down amendments and debate them. But the implications of the proposals make it very difficult for us to get the proper advice from the authorities concerned—the various bodies who are affected by the proposals. That makes it difficult for us to put down amendments which we are satisfied are substantive, and not those which could lead to the Opposition being accused of delaying tactics. There is very important substance here and even today we have received correspondence from the county authorities suggesting that certain parts of the Bill of which they had not been fully aware would have the same implications and therefore ask the House to consider this aspect of consultations. That will be dealt with when we come to this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our main concern is that we are asked to launch almost immediately into the clauses which are the subject of considerable controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties of getting proper information is that whilst the Minister produced his report in August, the Opposition side did not receive the consultative document until we visited one of the organisations concerned which was kind enough to photostat it and give it to us. I did not realise until some months later that there were other appendices to that document that further spelt out what the consultative document meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he would see that these procedures were corrected. We accept that and they are now working to that effect. That has meant considerable difficulties for us, however, in being able to carry out our functions as an Opposition, particularly in this first couple of weeks, in discovering the substance of the point and how we may establish what we think may be the mistakes in these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We address our amendments to particular clauses and have not concentrated on the other more definitive areas as laid down particularly in clauses 2 and 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that the Committee will accept that we have some difficulty, perhaps all Oppositions do, in securing advice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
about these matters in order to make a proper and substantial contribution to the debate. This is a controversial area. The authorities concerned are the best sources of advice alternative to that given by the Minister, and they are authorities, which by the nature of their organisation, are democratic bodies which are bound to consult committees and other organisations before they can give us a proper assessment of their opinion. Therefore we find ourselves in considerable difficulty in giving proper consideration to these clauses, and the sittings motion would make that more difficult. I do not suggest that we anticipate any difficulties, or that we shall ask for delays immediately after the recess, but in the period before the recess we find ouselves in considerable difficulties and we hope that the Committee will give consideration to that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr Lamond: Am I right in assuming, as the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr Booth) and his hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull-East (Mr Prescott) both referred to the amendment, that we are now debating the amendment as well as the substantive motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No amendment has been moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is considering what my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, will he consider another aspect to help the Committee? The Parliamentary Secretary may recall that in 1978, when he and I sat on a Committee of this nature, the then Minister of Transport produced a document through the Department—I hope the hon. Gentleman recalls the occasion—which interpreted, clause by clause, the Department's thinking. I am sure he would readily agree on that—indeed, I seem to remember that at the time he expressed the opinion that it was useful. I hope that the Minister will reciprocate and come up with something similar. It would be useful and informative, and I know that the Parliamentary Secretary found the previous document useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is in order, Mr Lamond, I wish now to move my amendment to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
sittings motion. I beg to move to leave out the words "and Thursdays" and to add instead thereof
	<br><blockquote><p>"until the Christmas Recess and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote>
I am waiting for the Minister to respond to some of the questions raised by my hon. Friends and myself. In moving the sittings motion he indicated that he wished Members to have an opportunity to discuss properly, and in detail, the matters covered by the Bill. He has given no indication yet how such a discussion would take place, given the peculiar instructions which he apparently gave to his Parliamentary draftsman concerning clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak with some trepidation as this is my first Standing Committee, but I support my right hon. Friend's amendment to the motion. Seen from the viewpoint of a newcomer to Parliament, it seems that the Minister has spent a great deal of time since the Bill was published, rushing about attempting to find out from various bodies, including the trade union which sponsors me as a Member of Parliament, their assessment of the Bill. It has proved difficult, especially for the bodies which are democratic, to make a true assessment of the impact of certain clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer in particular to the early clauses, apart from clause 1, namely clauses 2 and 3. These, together with schedule 1, are extremely complicated and it was clear on Second Reading that the Minister did not have a good grip of what the clauses intended. Looking further into this matter, there seems to be considerable inconsistency of definition between the early clauses and the clauses related to them in the Transport Act 1978 and the Passenger Vehicles (Experimental Areas) Act 1977 all of which are closely related to the definitions in the early clauses of the Bill. It is difficult to identify what some of the clauses are intended to do, and more important than that, whatever is the intention, whether the actual drafting will meet the Minister's objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the early part of the Bill, at any rate, is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are parts of the Bill, such as the denationalisation of the National Freight Corporation, which are, in a sense, just a matter of plain straightforward political controversy between the two major parties. However, the early clauses on bus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
licensing, go beyond mere political difference between the two main parties. Our intention is to try to achieve some sort of workable measure because, if poor definitions and conflict between one Act of Parliament and another will benefit no one. We find it extremely difficult to pursue these matters today, and certainly the views of the Minister seem to have changed over time. He found it necessary, as I recall, on Second Reading to interrupt a speech by one of my hon. Friend's to put right an explanation he had given earlier in the debate, which suggests that he also—quite naturally—finds it rather difficult to pursue these extremely difficult clauses and to identify exactly what they are intended to do. It therefore seems to me that if the Committee were to accept my right hon. Friend's proposition that we meet only once a week until the recess, there would not be any great loss of time to the Government. I submit that there would be the possibility of a very considerable gain in the standard of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be some confusion even about later parts of the Bill. Again, in the Second Reading debate my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull-East, (Mr. Prescott) drew the Minister's attention to certain obligations which the 1968 Transport Act placed upon both British Rail and the National Freight Corporation. That was denied in the Second Reading debate, but it is quite clear that the first sections of the 1968 Act place on British Rail and the National Freight Corporation the very obligations about which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East was talking. If, as recently as the Second Reading debate, the Minister did not think that these obligations existed, it seems that even he, with the assistance of his hordes of civil servants at the Ministry of Transport, still needs a great deal of illumination before he is able to conduct these proceedings properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He himself pointed out on Second Reading the very far-reaching changes to the law on bus licensing, and it seems that there is an obligation on him to be present to attempt—even if he does not succeed—to guide the Committee through the early clauses of part I of the Bill. There will be practically no loss to the Government in terms of time by accepting the amendment proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
in-Furness (Mr. Booth). Indeed, it might be a considerable saving in time because there would be some opportunity for the Opposition, who find briefing rather more difficult, to clarify our minds so that in the end the disputes in the Committee will be confined to genuine, material issues rather than long dissertations and arguments about what was intended and what is the precise meaning of various clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suport my right hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to supplement what my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has said. I hope that the Minister will consider my request for the document and in due course agree. Assuming that he does agree with what I said previously, does it not make fundamental sense to take one sitting before the recess which gives the department time to get the booklet out? If we do not do that, we shall find ourselves discussing a clause and subsequently receiving from the department a booklet which gives its interpretation of the clause. If the booklet is to make any sense or be of any use, it is fundamental that it should arrive as quickly as possible before we have gone through too many clauses. I support the amendment. It makes fundamental sense and I hope the Minister will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I intervene briefly. Perhaps I may correct the comment about my Second Reading speech. My intervention was to correct the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield), not to correct any misapprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make four short points, The first is on the question of Ministers attending Cabinet. This matter has been the subject of longstanding practice which has been respected by both sides of committee. I am sure we made the same provision for the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that those hon. Gentlemen who were members of the 1978 Committee—that certainly includes the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) who was the Secretary of State—will recall that we made it the custom throughout the proceedings on that Transport Bill that the then Secretary of State should attend Cabinet. I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
think anyone would expect us to do other than that. All we are seeking here, and I am proposing, is that the same course should be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that a number of detailed points have been made and clearly they can be debated when we come to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point is that we can consider in "the stand part" debate on clause 1 the purpose of the clause. I think that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) is wrong, but I understand the point he is making about the preliminary clause being an unusual clause. I would certainly seek to establish the stand part clause debate that that is not the case, and provide some examples which are very close to his home. The purpose of such a clause is to be helpful. We are criticised in this House for making obscure legislation. We are seeking in that preliminary clause to set out the main purposes of that part of the Bill and that, I think, is helpful to the Committee and, above all, to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth point that I would make is on the notes on clauses. I take entirely the remarks of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). He would like to have notes on clauses. I think that we can meet him on that point and we will certainly look at the matter. I think that we can provide notes on clauses for the whole Bill. We will do that. I think we could even prepare a special technical explanatory note on clauses 2 and 3 to circulate tomorrow. There is no reason why proceedings should be halted. I would have thought, Mr. Lamond, with those assurances I have given, that we could proceed to sit, as I originally proposed, on Tuesday and Thursday morning</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what the Minister has said, it is clear there may be some misapprehension about the references made in interventions on Second Reading. If I may make clear what I was referring to, that may be helpful to the Minister. Both he and the Parliamentary Secretary intervened in My Second Reading speech when I described the scope of the provisions of the Bill for contract carriages. They both asserted that I was wrong in the way I had defined the scope and went further in asserting that what I was defining was, in fact, the provisions of current legislation. I have since checked that in great detail
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and it is not the case. I was correct in my assertion that the scope of current legislation on contract carriages is very much narrower than that which is proposed in the Bill. We shall not clear this point up, I suppose, until we get to that part of the Bill when I can table an amendment to make the scope the same. I am sure that at that point the Minister will be prepared to concede that there is a very fundamental difference and, presumably will with draw the statement he made by way of intervention on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before we can proceed to that, we have a major hurdle to overcome. The Minister is wrong in his assertion that provision was made for me to miss Committee to attend Cabinet during the period when I was a Cabinet Minister. No such provision was ever made during the time when I was a Cabinet Minister during the last Government. I am not saying that in order to suggest that we should not make such an arrangement for the right hon. Gentleman or that such an arrangement is not commonly made. It is commonly made when Governments of various complexions are in office, and in the normal way we would be quite happy to accommodate such an arrangement, but we are asking merely that for two sittings, which is what it will mean in practice, between now and Christmas, we have the Minister in attendance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister goes on to say that the details of this can be debated. We are in the gravest doubts as to whether the details are debatable in so far as they are laid out in the purposes of the Bill in clause 1. Later, I shall have to make submissions to you, Mr. Lamond, on this particular aspect, but, no doubt, you will advise us about how it can be debated and what type of amendments are in order. The Minister says that the clause is not unusual and that he will be able to show us a precedent for such a course. I shall be very surprised indeed if he can show us precedent clauses defining purposes of Bills and which have been unamendable. It has been the practice for more years than I can recall that the House has been able to debate clauses through amendents; as you will no doubt advise us, Mr. Lamond. Amendments have been accepted, by a long tradition of this House, which could probe the meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled a long list of amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
ments designed both to probe and to change clause 1. We have also tabled amendments which point out errors in clause 1 in that it does not define the full purposes of Part I of the Bill. There is obviously a defect. Until we find it and until the Minister provides us with a precedent clause I cannot see that we can achieve what he is suggesting, namely a detailed debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It demonstrates a most remarkable lack of courtesy, if nothing else, for us to be faced just 24 hours before a Committee starts with this difficulty. I would be very happy to have an adjournment of the Committee while we examine the Minister's claim that the clause is not uncommon. Above all, he must indicate to us where there is a precedent because in the whole of my experience in this House on a great many Standing Committees, I have yet to come up against this peculiar beast—the unamendable clause, and certainly I have never encountered an unamendable clause when the Minister responsible for its drafting has stated that there will be an opportunity to debate it in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if one accepted the desirability of commencing the Bill in this way, we should want it at least to be done in a manner which is consistent with the contents of the Bill, and that is not the case here. I must ask the Minister, first, to retract what he said about provision being made for me as the Cabinet Minister to attend Cabinet meetings during Standing Committee sittings, because that was not done. Secondly, will he indicate how the details of this clause can be debated before he has given an indication of how similar clauses have been dealt with in the past so that the normal type of amendment to content or probing amendment can be tabled, enabling us to proceed with the Bill in a reasonable and orderly way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very unusual state of affairs when the clause 1 of a Bill cannot be amended. To have pages of amendments simply struck out is very odd and deserves a full statement from the Minister. I find myself in some difficulty because of an established convention. I sat behind the Secretary of State in Committee in 1978 as his party private secretary. On most Thursday mornings he attended the Cabinet. As my right hon. Friend said, that is quite usual. However, we are now in an unusual situation. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
two parts of this problem simply do not fit together. We want a clear explanation of why the Bill has been drafted in this idiosyncratic way, when apparently, for reasons which I do not yet understand, we cannot amend clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to see the Minister going to a Cabinet meeting. I was sorry when the Ministry of Transport was reduced to non-Cabinet rank. When the Department was of Cabinet rank the full force of the transport argument was felt at Cabinet level. Therefore I do not regret that he is going—although I should like to hear his counsel—because he will, rightly, make the wishes of transport felt at Cabinet level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in an unsatisfactory situation because, if one cannot amend clause 1, and therefore if clause 1 and subsequent clauses have an overlap in any way—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that clause 1 is unamendable. That is certainly no part of my contention. Does my hon. Friend assume that those amendments which have been tabled are the only type possible, or does he think that the form of the amendments is in some way unacceptable? When we have had your guidance, Mr. Lamond, as to the form which will be acceptable, possibly we shall have an opportunity to table a whole range of amendments on this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) relate his remarks a little more closely to the amendment to the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the point which I was making was that, if we are to have this unusual situation, we need an explanation about it from the Minister. To reply to my right hon. Friend, it might be that all amendments are out of order or it might be that we have put them in the wrong form. I think that we shall subsequently need the Chairman's advice on this matter, but—more than that—we shall need the Minister's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which I welcomed was the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) who said that he looked forward to an explanation of the background to some of the clauses so that we can understand the Minister's thinking. As an East Anglian Member of Parliament I echo that argument because these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
clauses will affect transport in my area in a very fundamental way. I shall have to conduct a great deal of consultation on a detailed level to see precisely how these things will work out. Therefore, what my right hon. Friend has said with regard to the sittings motion has a great deal of relevance for us here today, and we are certainly not wasting the Committee's time. It is quite crucial that we should see these areas clarified precisely before we take any further steps forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin, Mr. Lamond, by saying how pleased I am to be serving under your chairmanship on the first Committee of which I have had the privilege of being a member since my return to the House. Knowing as I do, your keen sense of what is in order and what is not, I quail before the prospect of our future sittings. I am sure you will keep us in order throughout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise to support my right hon. Friend's point about the pair requested by the Minister of Transport so that he can attend Cabinet meetings. On this side of the Committee we have no wish to frustrate the right hon. Gentleman's wish to attend his Cabinet meetings. On the contrary, we shall be delighted if he does attend them for reasons already put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). But we want to discuss clause 1, which is extremely important, in the presence of the Minister. I do not think that that is an unreasonable request. We want him to be here not just to tell us that the clause is a usual clause. In our opinion it is not a usual clause; it is a unique clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Lamond, I wish to move a further amendment to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move to leave out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>The Minister has already said that he will demonstrate to us that that is not correct, that it is, if not a usual, at least a precedented clause and that it has appeared in other Bills. We want him to explain that to us in person. We also want him to listen to our points and arguments on the other side of the case. He cannot do that if he is attending Cabinet. So we are very disturbed to learn that we may be discussing clause 1 in his absence.</p>

	<p>I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask him to be present. I am glad that he is being co-operative about the provision of the background briefing and information which has been requested already. I am glad that he is being co-operative to that extent, although I am a little surprised that since Second Reading we have not received that background information. To me that is an ominous omission, and I am very concerned that he did not follow the precedent established by the previous Administration in providing such information without being asked. The fact that the Minister has made that omission, the fact that he apparently wants to be absent while we are discussing a most important clause of the Bill, does not lead me to be optimistic about the future arrangements for co-operation between the two sides of the Committee, and it is important in Committees of this sort to have co-operation. We have come to the Committee in a helpful attitude; I hope the Minister will be equally helpful.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put:</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>

	<p>and to add instead thereof
	<br><blockquote><p>"at half-past Ten o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Three o'clock until the Christmas Recess and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>The purpose of the amendment is to meet the Minister's objections in full. It was not the intention of my hon. Friends
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
and I in the preceding amendment to prevent the Minister from attending Cabinet, and I do not know how it could possibly have been construed that there was such an intention. By avoiding Thursday sittings, as our previous amendment would have done, there could have been no question of the Minister being prevented from attending Cabinet. Was the Minister's objection to that amendment that it would have cut down the number of sittings on the Bill before Christmas. If it was not, I hope that he will intervene and tell me so that we may be clear about his objections.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friends and I are not going to be particular to within half an hour for the starting time of the Committee, but our aim is to have the Minister with us during the proceedings on clause 1, or at least for the first two sittings when we shall be discussing it. That will be possible if we meet on Tuesday morning and on the Thursday afternoon. We will have the same number of sittings per week and we will be able to examine what is undoubtedly the most important clause to the Bill.</p>

	<p>I would put it to the Minister, through you, Mr. Lamond, that if it is possible to define the purposes of a Bill in a way which cannot be discussed on amendments in Committee then we have a very special problem. It is not just a problem of opposition, it is a problem of all hon. Members of the House of Commons.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Neale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond. Has an amendment been moved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, an amendment has been moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Lamond, for making that clear. May I make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I am as much concerned about his rights in the point I am now making as I am about those of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suggesting that the difficulty that faces all of us, other than Ministers, is that if we cannot examine on amendments to define the purposes of a Bill we may well find that those who subsequently have to interpret the Bill in the courts will have the purposes defined in a way which has not been subject to amendment by Parliament. In the absence of any other guidance as to the proper administration of clauses of the Bill, the courts turn to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
indications given in the Bill as to what the intention of Parliament was and it will be taken, without any shadow of doubt, that it was the intention of Parliament that the purposes of the Bill are as outlined in the clause which Parliament has not been able to amend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, that would be an absolute nonsense and I am quite sure that the Minister is not trying to create such a difficulty for my hon. Friends or for his hon. Friends. Therefore, I take it that he will be prepared to be with us while we are discussing this particular issue on clause 1, and I admit to all hon. Ministers that the amendment that I have now moved gives us an opportunity to do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendments other than those that I have mentioned would be more acceptable to him, and would meet his objection of interfering with his Cabinet attendance, of course, we can meet him on that. I can quote, if it is necessary to do so, a number of examples of the problem which I have indicated. But at least in those cases Parliament has had the chance to consider the wording of Bills which have stated intentions laid out by Parliament, and where they have done so the courts have given due weight and regard to those intentions. However, to have it stated in a way which Parliament cannot discuss, considerably circumscribes the powers of Parliament as against the Executive. In other words, the Executive would define purposes and Parliament would do what it could with clauses once the purposes had been defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister and his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary have too much respect for Parliament—or, if I might put it this way, have too much respect for democracy—to attempt to put any body of this House in such a situation. We need to find a way to discuss this, and I hope that subsequently the Minister will join with me in making a submission to you, Mr. Lamond, on this point in order that we can remove this very serious difficulty, which is, in fact, a major constitutional problem for a Committee of this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my right hon. Friend has raised a considerable point. By putting down an amendment that we meet on Thursday at 3.30, the last day before Parliament goes into recess, he shows a dedication to carrying out the duties of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the Opposition, because one would primarily be thinking about how one got away early enough for Christmas. That is a natural thought for each of us to have in mind. Therefore, the proposition that the sittings motion for Thursday should now be changed from 10.30 in the morning to 3.30 in the afternoon is one that creates more inconvenience to hon. Members of this committee. However, the point that is being made, and to which we should give very serious consideration, is the point made by my right hon. Friend on the purpose of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has caused considerable difficulty for us and it is not. the intention at this stage to debate clause 1. No doubt, that time will arrive in due course. However, because one was left with the difficulties of attempting to understand the object of clause 1, one was forced perhaps to consider how to amend that particular clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendments to this clause, are not accepted, in the sense that one would use amendments to define exactly what the purposes of the various provisions are, one will be forced to wait until the relevant clauses, but that puts importance on this particular clause in that it is included for others to see what Parliament intended as the purpose of the Bill. The Minister made clear earlier that he would give some examples to show that this was not unique. That may well be the case, and we shall wait for the evidence. Nevertheless, we are still faced with the difficulty of a very important clause to which amendments are unlikely to be acceptable and which will act as guidance to others on this legislation. As I understand it, there have been cases in the past when clauses in Bills have defined the purposes of a particular piece of legislation and this has led to controversy in the courts as to the interpretation of the clause and, indeed, the purpose laid out in earlier clauses. No doubt we shall thrash that out later. But if clause 1 has the important function of bearing out the purpose of the Bill, the Minister of Transport—perhaps it will be Secretary of State one day—is the only person who can give the most diligent statement on what the purposes are. Indeed, if people are to look at the purposes of the measure as embodied in the Bill itself, and at the definition as outlined in the debate, it seems to confirm what I always thought was the position—that courts look at the legislation itself and not
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
at what was said or intended. If there was a certain conflict in the clauses which follow clause 1, and if the House decided to reject some of those clauses, the debate on clause 1 would need to take place afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point we are making, particularly on this clause, is that it is very important that the Minister himself is in attendance. We recognise that Cabinet duties are an important function for Ministers, and that agreements take place between both sides to allow Ministers to observe their obligations, but we feel strongly about this, since it is becoming increasingly clear that clause 1 is very important in that it states the Bill's purpose. It is important that the statements come from the Minister himself as to exactly how he envisages the purpose of the Bill, so that that guidance can be carried through when we debate the meaning of later clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, if the explanation is somewhat different from the contents of the clause, that may give rise to further difficulties. But it is important, not only for the Bill itself, but for the debate that must follow, that the Minister be in attendance so that there can be no doubt about exactly what the statement, intentions and purpose of the Bill are as defined in clause 1</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In rising to support my right hon. and hon. Friends in the amendment, I hope that the Minister is duly impressed by the united desire on this side of the Committee to have him present, not only for his flow and grasp of the Bill and the pungent points which he may make, but also for his ability to listen to the points which we may make. That is very important. It is important that the Committee gets off on the right foot and that both sides understand what the Bill is about. Opposition Members want the Minister here on these occasions to hear our points and to give his interpretation of the points that we make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand his opposition to the previous amendment. Whilst I do not agree with him, it is perfectly understandable since that amendment would have restricted the number of Committee meetings prior to the recess. On that basis I can understand his objections. My right hon. Friend and Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), in moving the amendment, has suggested a sensible compromise that would meet the Minis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
ter's objections inasmuch as we are not now, under this amendment, restricting the number of Committee meetings. It says much for my hon. Friends that we are agreeing to meet at 3.30 on Thursday prior to the recess to try to meet, not our own commitment, but the Minister's commitment to the Cabinet, which we all fully recognise. In that way he can attend the Cabinet and we can have his presence here when we debate this vital clause 1, which has many interpretations. I would not digress to talk about clause 1 now, but at this stage it is vital that we get off on the right foot. If the Minister could see fit to accept this amendment, it would meet his objection to the first amendment which he opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>; I must confess that although I was unhappy with the first amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), I eventually voted for it on the balance of advantage. However, I am much happier with this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first amendment there was a certain amount of destructive impulse. But because we could not have the Minister here, we were seeking to curtail the number of sittings. Broadly speaking, that means if one cannot have what one wants, one burns the house down. I do not think that that is quite the way to proceed. This amendment has my full support, because it does what all amendments should do, namely, recommends a constructive alternative. I suggest that this has been done and I support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that should be noted by the Committee is that this amendment is a flattering tribute to the Minister. There is no doubt about that, and while I am on my feet I want to underline the fact that on transport matters the Minister is knowledgeable. Having sat through all the transport debates in the Chamber over the past two years, I am sure that my hon. Friends join me in paying tribute to the right hon. Gentleman's perseverance in transport matters over a long period. I noticed that the Minister appeared on Anglia Television last Friday evening, and I was pleased to see that, because one does get a better class of person on Anglia Television. It is a tribute to him, too, that he was invited there to talk about transport matters in the Eastern region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of the amendment is
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
to have the Minister's advice on the complex matter of transport policy. I do not believe that it would have been a good idea to have cut out two sittings before Christmas Recess, because I find the Bill complex. It deals with matters in great detail, and a great deal of study and thought will be required to understand the full implications of many of its provisions. In a Bill of any kind, one of the basic arguments is about its purpose or purposes. The context of most political arguments is to sort out the purpose of a subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 is a statement of purposes. Therefore, if we preclude any amendments on this multiplicity of purposes, we exclude a great deal of debate. This is the why we need the Minister here to give us the full benefit of his parliamentary knowledge on transport matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my reasons for supporting the amendment is that it enables us to gather more information—not to be able to pronounce on these matters, but to be able to ask further questions to which we must have answers. As I said earlier, I represent a part of the world where transport is pretty thin. I do not want to trespass into any of the subsequent clauses, but it is my view that some of the provisions will have a devastating effect on the rural areas of East Anglia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in the three sittings of this Committee that are left before Christmas, I want to ascertain the precise purpose of some of these proposals, because during the recess I shall have to have a great deal of consultation with Eastern National—part of the bus company—with private tour operators and with all sorts of people, before I can come to any conclusions. Had the first amendment been carried—and, in retrospect, I am glad that it was not—we would have curtailed the Committee's time. If my right hon. Friend reflects on this matter he might agree that that might not have been a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, in fact, we are doing is combining the maximum advantages of the Minister's presence in this Committee. First of all, it will enable him to go along to the Cabinet on Thursday morning and to state that all of us on both sides of the Committee are united in the view that transport can make an important contribution to the nation's economy. That will enable him to give the Cabinet his views on the matter. However, if we have a sitting at half-past Three in the afternoon, it will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
enable him to go to the Cabinet, and at the same time it will enable us to discuss transport matters in the afternoon. Perhaps, indeed, he might easily tell us whether the Cabinet has given a favourable response to transport matters in the broad picture of the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that everyone would be impressed if we could tell our constituents that on the third day before we rose for Christmas—the last thing we did before leaving the House of Commons was to talk about transport matters in their interest. This amendment enables us to do that. They would be even more impressed if we could say that as well as discussing transport matters in the interests of East Anglia the Minister was present giving his advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to the Committee, I must have important consultations. I note what was said in the House the other afternoon about cuts in civil service manpower affecting the Department of Transport. This is relevant to the amendment because what was said, as I understand it, was that the staff of the Department of Transport will be cut by 18 per cent. In other words, as this Bill proceeds we will be faced by a Department of Transport which has a leaner and hungrier look. I wonder whether the 18 per cent cut will result in the Department of Transport doing less. Or has the man from Marks and Spencers done his deadly work at Marsham Street? I think all these things trouble the Committee and I think they are all relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the possibility that the prospect of the reduction in the number of people employed in the Department of Transport, or indeed the discussions which civil servants in the Department of Transport are perforce having to have with the gentleman from Marks and Spencers, may be responsible for the delay in providing the background notes needed in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that is an intervention which I welcome because the one thing I have missed over the months is the euphemistic prose of the Department of Transport. In fact, I do not know how I have lived without it. When I came here today and I saw that the notes were missing—I may add that when we were in
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Government we provided very detailed notes—my heart missed a beat. Among other things, this amendment gives the Minister time to reflect that these notes, which he says he will provide, will be a very great asset to the Committee in troubled times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in my hon. Friend's appreciation of the euphemistic prose of this incredible shrinking department. I agree far more with his remarks on that than with his highly controversial remarks, if I may say so, about the superiority of one television channel over another. He has to remember, I hope, that there are people on the Committee from many parts of the country, including one representing the Tyne Tees area, who might want to cross swords with him. We do not want to have any differences on the Opposition side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to him that, if he is concerned that there is euphemistic prose of the department to be found in notes, he might turn his eyes to a very prolific source of prose from the department, namely the press notices which come out day by day. I am sure we should not expect a shrinking department to be able to devote time both to such a prolific source of press notices and to notes on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the right hon. Gentleman is tempted too far down that path, I remind him that we are discussing an amendment concerned with sitting on Thursdays at 3.30 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped you were not going so far as to rebuke me for straying off the point, Mr. Lamond, because I have found one thing in my short political life—that what escapes many people most often is the obvious. I have also found—I am rather dismayed about this—that in politics one does not simply have to make the point; one has to hit it with an iron bar. This amendment about when the sittings should take place is crucial. As I have said, I do not accept the principle that the amendment is self-evident; I think it has to be argued out.

My right hon. Friend has my support in this and I hope that we have the support of the Government side. If Conservative Members support the amendment, letting their own Minister go to a Cabinet meeting to argue the cause of transport and

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
then come back here at the later hour so that we can discuss transport affairs and get important questions of the Bill clarified, we shall be maximising advantage and they will be expressing an enormous vote of confidence in their own Minister in the context of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not sure whether the Minister was trying to catch your eye, Mr. Lamond. If he were, I would defer to him, as my own remarks may then be unnecessary. It looks as though he is not trying to catch your eye after all, which does not surprise us very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has just said that he would hope that the last thing he can do before going down or up to Ipswich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Across to Ipswich for the Christmas Recess, would have been to discuss this Bill in the presence of the Minister. I hope that that is not my hon. Friend's argument. I am quite sure that he was minimising his own contribution to the House because, if we were to meet next Thursday at 3.30 p.m., that would not be the last thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich would do before he took his well-earned Christmas rest. But I was absolutely in agreement with my hon. Friend when he said that so often in politics it seems that it is necessary to point to the obvious and in fact to hit the point with an iron bar. It looks as though we are having to hit the point with an iron bar on this occasion in order to get across to the Minister how much we want to discuss clause 1 in his presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has suggested that if we meet on Thursdays at 3.30 p.m,. we can meet the wishes of both sides of the Committee. By meeting on Thursday in the afternoon we can allow the Minister to attend his Cabinet meetings and ourselves have the benefit of his precence while discussing clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) referred to the ability of the Minister to be a good listener. We have had plenty of evidence of that this morning because it is quite clear that is all Conservative Members are able to do is to listen. We have had a very short contribution from the Minister himself and we have heard noth-
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
ing at all from the Under-secretary or indeed from any of his colleagues, except for two brief points of order. I am very glad about this and it is a good omen for our discussions in the future, but I wish they would go a bit further and contribute to the Committee in a short statement. I am not asking the Minister to make a contribution. We should be grateful if he would take the opportunity to express his agreement with the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend. I think my right hon. Friend's amendment is a most generous gesture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with my hon. Friend from Newcastle upon Tyne, Central on one point. He said that he understood the Minister's opposition to the previous amendment. I do not understand his opposition to this amendment. Indeed, I do not understand any opposition to this amendment. This amendment is a generous gesture from Labour members of the Committee. The Minister has not risen to speak and it would seem that he does not intend to speak. There are only two reasons for his silence apart from his wonder at the loquacity of Opposition Members. Either he will not reply, or he cannot reply. If he will not reply, then we can only believe it is because he does not want to, that he is not interested in what is being said by the Opposition—if he is listening at all. Or, if he cannot reply, it must be because he has nothing to say. He has no answer to this because he knows that my right hon. Friend in moving the amendment took care of any possible objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making the Government a fair offer to make progress with this Bill by meeting on Thursday afternoons to allow the Minister to attend his Cabinet meetings in the morning. In this way Conservative Members and the Minister lose absolutely nothing—they get everything they want. But they are sticking out to meet on Thursday mornings at 10.30 a.m. and I am disappointed. Their failure to reply to the points made by my hon. Friends leads me to question their ability to reply later in our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a reasonable suggestion. I am sorry that the Minister is apparently not willing either to accept it or to explain why he will not accept it. It will have to go on record that this Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
simply reject Opposition arguments without giving any reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I am rather naive, being a new Member of this House and serving on a Standing Committee for the first time, but I am rather puzzled and dismayed at the sitting this morning. Being the only Scottish Member, I should have thought there would be much more time allowed between the printing of the Bill and the first meeting of the Committee to allow for consultations between the transport operators, regional councils, or county councils as you have them in England and Wales consumers and other interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that time must be given to consult every interested party in transport, particularly in Scotland, because it is a tremendous job and the time factor could not be given way to; but I still think there should be more time for consultation. I should have thought that the Minister would have automatically attended every sitting of this Committee. I have a lot to learn about transport and would welcome hearing him. I should be disappointed if he were not here. I do not think I would learn so much. It is only right and fair that he should he here to hear all points of view. The amendment which would allow him to be here is one which the Government cannot reasonably oppose. I should have thought that almost every clause in the Bill, if we had the opportunity to debate them all, would have been allowed. But the first I knew about being allowed to debate them was when I came into the Committee and picked up the note which says that there are no amendments selected to be debated. This seems rather wrong to me. I should have thought that every clause with amendments, unless there are technical reasons, should be debated. In the interests of fairness, we should be given the opportunity of tabling amendments which would be in order and would be discussed by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) I would welcome the provision of notes, because these can only help the members of the Committee and help to make it a much better Bill. The amendment appears to me to be a perfectly reasonable amendment and we could get down to the real work before us
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
instead of wasting time. We could have been already into the business of the Bill if the Government had accepted what we are suggesting. I did not come here to be deprived of the opportunities of discussing points I wish to make in the Bill, and I did not come here to waste time. It is a reasonable amendment, and if the Government will agree to accept it we can get down to the business before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We find ourselves in a dilemma. Those of us on this side of the Committee who are very interested in transport have been disappointed that the Minister is not a Member of the Cabinet. We recognise the technical reason for that and as we have made clear in the House already and in private to the Minister, we welcome the fact that he attends Cabinet meetings because we are concerned to ensure that transport gets a fair crack of the whip—if that is the right description of the present Cabinet—when these matters are being discussed. In particular at a time when the transport industries are threatened with reductions in contributions towards their running costs, when the question of further rail electrification is a major matter of great interest to the railway industry and to the people who work in it, and when discussions are going on in this country, in France and with the EEC about the possibility of a rail-only Channel tunnel, we are most concerned to ensure that the Minister of Transport is present at Cabinet Meetings. He must have the opportunity to put the case for these major transport matters, which undoubtedly call for substantial central Government funds of one sort and another. Therefore, we are most concerned not to demand his presence here and prevent him from attending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point. If the Committee is to meet when the Cabinet is meeting, there is every possibility, particularly on Part I, clause 1—and I do not intend this as any slur on the Minister—that his mind may occasionally wander from important Cabinet business because he will be wondering what is happening here to the Bill, which he has described as a most important piece of legislation. Conversely, if he attended the Committee rather than the Cabinet, it seems quite possible, as he is just as human as the rest of us, that his attention might wander at this meeting because he would be wondering what was happening
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
to the interests of transport in the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to realise that we appreciate his problems and it is in an effort to resolve them that my right hon. Friend has proposed the amendment. Others have paid enormous tributes to the Minister's grasp of transport matters. I am not sure that I entirely go along with some of the laudatory things that have been said about him, largely because I have only been in this place since May and do not know a great about the Minister. I have read his important Conservative Party document "The Right Track" which might be described as a green paper—it had a green binding. It was very interesting. I regarded it as rubbish but it obviously—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>; Order. Will the hon. Gentleman relate his remarks a little more closely to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Lamond. I will attempt to relate what I was saying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. Does he not agree that one of the advantages of the Minister being here at our debates is that, as he knows, transport problems arise quickly in many parts of the country from day to day. If he were here and a problem arose, he would be able to answer relevant questions at the appropriate time if those matters concerned the business of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some merit in my hon. Friend's intervention because as matters stand today, we are constantly receiving representations from transport bodies about matters being brought to their attention and which they want to draw to our attention while we are serving on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the need for the Minister to be at our sittings, the right hon. Gentleman certainly possesses more expertise in transport matters than most members of his party. He has paid considerable attention to the subject of transport over the past few years, as one would expect from the shadow transport spokesman. In addition to that he has no doubt played an important and detailed part in the preparation of this legislation. He has had the benefit of discussions with his departmental advisers and with the lawyers who have been involved in the drafting of the Bill, in particular, in respect of clause 1,
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
which seems to me to be the most important, which lays down whether we can amend the Bill. It purports to describe what part I of the Bill is about. It provides the framework and justification for everything that comes later. Yesterday I was advised by agents who act for the National Union of Railwaymen that it could be argued, rather like the relationship of the long title to the rest of the Bill, that the Bill would be deficient and difficult to interpret in the courts if the preliminary clause did not cover all aspects of Part I. We should like to make sure that it does, because there is no merit in ending with a law which is difficult for those who have to interpret it as part of their day-to-day business to do so, and which would enable the lawyers at a later stage to make fortunes from interpreting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the case being made by my hon. Friend show the basis for our debating clause 1 step by step because we must get the clause right. This would tie in with the amendment, because clearly at 3.30 p.m., when the Minister returns suitably refreshed from the Cabinet meeting and tells us how transport relates to the economy of the country, we could go thoroughly into clause 1 and make sure we get it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that it is vital to have the Minister of Transport's advice on the preliminary clause above all. We need, too, through him, the advice of his Civil Service advisers on some of the other clauses. But on the preliminary clause my right hon. and hon. Friends consider the Minister's presence vital. The Minister has access to information and processes of thought to which we have not had access. If we are to achieve a reasonable Act of Parliament eventually it would be better for us to have access to all the information and all the processes of thought that have gone into the preparation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why my right hon. and hon. Friends are so keen to have the Minister here. I should not wish to sow seeds of discontent among Conservative Members. I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends would agree with me that in seeking to have the Minister present, we cast no slur whatever on the ability or talents of the Parliamentary Secretary who, certainly throughout the time I have been in this House, has shown a very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
thorough grasp of transport matters when dealing with questions or in taking part in debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that he will be making an important contribution to the deliberations of the Committee. But for clause 1 we require the presence of and contributions from the Minister because this is such a vital clause. It is, if not unique, certainly unusual in its nature and it seeks to define part I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If later clauses are not within the categories described in the preliminary clause then it may be that the Bill will be found to be faulty, just as if the items in the Bill were not covered by the long title. I think it is worth saying that there seems to be some shortcoming in the long life as it stands and this may be a matter to which we would wish to draw the Committee's attention at a later stage even with the Bill as presently drafted, let alone as we would like to amend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on a personal note, I would like to say that the proposition put forward by my right hon. Friend would certainly, before Christmas, suit me down to the ground as well. We are not entirely concerned with the Minister's convenience. As a member of the Select Committee on the Environment I would have to attend the Standing Committee while the Select Committee on the Environment is meeting on Thursdays at 10.30. So, besides the advantage to the Minister, there would be a considerable advantage to myself, at least until Christmas, in being able to attend the Environment Select Committee in the morning and the Transport Committee in the afternoon, and I hope that that will commend itself not only to my colleagues but to Conservative Members, so that hon. Members can play as big a part as possible in the various Committee proceedings in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say that he has been persuaded by the arguments, at least by the eloquence of my colleagues if not by anything that I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please take my word for it, Mr. Lamond, that I am very reluctant to intervene in this debate again. But there are a number of points that I have to make. I hope that Government Back Benchers are not impatient with all this discussion because we have not had any
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
response from them and in the absence of any response, it is very difficult to know where to pitch the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since there has been silence from the other side then there must inevitably be a certain amount of speculation on the Opposition Benches. It crossed my mind, when thinking about this amendment a moment ago, that we might be in for a pleasant surprise in a few moments because this silence might signify assent to some of our arguments we have been putting forward. It signifies amusement, in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am making is that it is very difficult to reach the truth through process of argument, and that is what argument is for, basically, in a debate on this amendment or on any other matter. We try to reach the truth through a process of argument and counter-argument. When the argument comes from only one side of the Committee it is difficult to reach any truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that the purpose of argument is not only to arrive at truth, but also to arrive at agreement? One of the difficulties this morning in trying to reach an agreement has been that Conservative Members have not made any response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to that intervention I must say that broadly the form of political argument, in transport and other matters, sometimes fills me with dismay. What it amounts to is assertion and counter-assertion and simply two flat statements either side. What we are coming to in this debate, because there is no response from the other side, is that there is no argumentative process at all by which we can reach any meaningful conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With this amendment, as in any other way, mystique plays a great part in politics. The public will want to know whether the Bill has the personal authority of the Minister behind it at every stage. I said some minutes ago that I saw the Minister talking about transport matters in East Anglia. Afterwards, when I made an appearance in the Silent Street working men's club, people on the floor of that club asked me if I actually knew the Minister of Transport, the man who had just appeared. I said that I knew him very well. I can assure you, Mr. Lamond, that they were very impressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of his consti-

	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
tuency, it might be better if he were to use a different turn of phrase. The impression I received was that in the club he referred to the members were lying on the floor. I cannot believe that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gilroy Bevan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lamond, are we not straying somewhat from the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When I think that hon. Members are straying somewhat from the amendment I will call attention to that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case it is thought in some quarters that this is a filibuster, let me say that it is nothing of the sort. Nothing is further from my mind when I am on my feet. Time is too valuable in life to be wasted in any sort of prodigal way, in this Committee or in anywhere else? The point I seek to make is that if we pass this amendment so that we are enabled to have the Minister's presence, it will put a stamp of authority on the Bill that only his presence at every sitting of the Committee can possibly make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make some sort of apology because when I said a few kind words about the Minister and his presence a few moments ago, I was not in any way detracting from the qualifications and status of the Parliamentary Secretary. One of the things which impressed me when I saw him at one Question Time answering numerous questions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at this stage. I will finish the point. I saw him at one stage in Question Time answering a lot of questions without notes. He just stood at the Dispatch Box without papers or a book. I can tell you, Mr. Lamond, that when a Minister of any kind answers questions without a book, a number of things happen. Either he is very confident to the extent that he needs no information, or the book has been left in the Department of Transport. I can tell you, Mr. Lamond, from previous occasions that when one does not have the answers in the book, the answers one gives to the House are always much more exciting. I think that in the Parliamentary Secretary we have a man not only of vision, but of considerable improvisation. When I said my kind words
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
about the Minister it in no way detracted from the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary can do very well in this Committee, or indeed in any other context, because he brings a wealth of experience with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which depresses me about transport Bills and any other Bill is the fact that, when six ordinary people sit down in the drawing room to talk about a matter, they can talk about it quite adequately in simple language and we all understand what we are talking about. Then we employ expensive men—parliamentary draftsmen—to turn it into language which most people do not understand anyway. Then we have to employ other expensive men to turn the gobbledegook back into the ordinary English language with which we started in the drawing room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister is here at these debates, as this amendment says that he would be, he would be the man who would cast light into dark places in complicated clauses of the Bill. If we met at 3.30 p.m., it is a psychological fact and it is attested by bodies of psychology that the contemplative powers of any single individual or any group of individuals are most powerful in the afternoon. I was in education before I became a politician and I can assure you, Mr. Lamond, that that is so. The learning process is greater in the afternoon than it is before noon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point I had not taken into consideration. We must have in the Committee the Minister to answer significant and important questions, to service the Committee from the Government Front Bench in the way it should be served.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Minister of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to what has been said. First, let me say that both the Parliamentary Secretary and I are flattered by the kind words of the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). We will seek to reciprocate during the course of the Bill all the things that he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are impressed by the desire of the Opposition to sit in afternoons. That is a point which is coming through as well. I must, however, say to the Committee that my advice remains the same. It would be for the greatest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
convenience of the Committee to sit in the mornings on Tuesday and Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members here served on the Transport Bill Standing Committee in 1978. At the beginning of that Bill the Secretary of State proposed his sittings motion and I responded in these terms. I assured the right hon. Gentleman, then Secretary of State, that it would not be our intention
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any way unnecessarily to delay the Committee. As an earnest of our intent, I think that we could agree without further debate to the Secretary of State's motion that we sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past ten o'clock." [
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 31 January 1978; C.4.]</p></blockquote>
That was the attitude only a few months ago of the then Opposition in talking about a subject which I think many of us regard as important—transport policy. That is what we want to get on to and what we want to talk about. I realise that the hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) was not concerned with transport at the time, but that was the tradition that we had in our Committee. We have had a long and full debate on that issue and I believe that it would be much better if we made progress on the original proposition that I made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It comes strange from a Minister who has his Bill prepared in such a way as this to appeal to the Opposition to have a regard for tradition in the way they handle the first motion before the Committee. May I make it clear that it was not because I considered it to be for the convenience of Members that I moved the amendment which we are now debating. On the contrary, in all the time I have been in the House I have never regarded it as convenient for Members to have to be present in Standing Committees while the Chamber is sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the unique features of this place flows from hon. Members being able to go to the Chamber to raise matters there, matters of importance to their constituents and of importance to the nation. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
would never contend that it would be a convenient arrangement to be sitting up here to discuss a Bill even as important as this one if by doing so we were to be deprived of the opportunity to attend the Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I did propose the change was that on a balance of consideration for the Minister I thought that it would be better to deprive ourselves of the inalienable right of hon. Members to be present in the Chamber in order that we could accommodate his wish not to be detained from Cabinet while we are discussing clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to appeal to you, Mr. Lamond, for some assistance. It will have become clear to you very early, with your considerable experience, that the difficulty which has led my hon. Friends and myself to pursue this amendment stems in large part from the way in which clause 1 is drafted. I draw your attention to the very first line which says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purposes for which this Part is enacted include—"</p></blockquote>
On that it is immediately apparent that it is necessary to define what certain of the purposes of clause 1 are. Had that been self-evident in the way that subsequent clauses were drafted, it would not have been necessary to have such a first clause; but the Minister has judged that it is necessary. The Minister has judged that when people come to read the Act, if the Bill becomes law, they will need to be guided as to certain of the purposes of clause 1. That is the basis of the submission which I am now putting to you, Mr. Lamond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, I want to know how we, doing our job properly as a Standing Committee on the Bill, can pass a judgment on which clauses of the part 1 need to be treated in this way. The Minister has formed a view. He has referred to certain of the purposes. We have had no opportunity to express a view as to which of the clauses in the part I need to be defined in this way, or whether some of them are self-explanatory. If the Minister in replying had given us the guidance which I sought when I addressed him earlier through you, Mr. Lamond, as to the precedent for this approach, we might have been able to clear up this matter and proceed on our way. He has not given that guidance. He has not suggested to us any other Bills which have been before the House in which there has been a definition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
of certain purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening very closely to the right hon. Gentleman. Certainly I think that the points he is making will be relevant when we reach the Bill, but we are discussing an amendment to the sittings motion. Therefore, strictly speaking, the points which he is putting are out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise most profusely, Mr. Lamond. The last thing I want is to be out of order. Of course I shall be guided by you on this and seek to make clear the way in which I believe that this must affect the attitude of myself and my hon. Friends towards the sittings motion. The amendment was designed to anable the Minister to be preseent without reducing the number of sittings. We needed the Minister to present because, in part, we are faced with a particular difficulty. If we were to discuss the clause without having a vehicle on which to express our view as to which purposes should be included in the first part of the Bill, we should be unable to express that view. Presumably—here again I seek your guidance, Mr. Lamond—if this amendment were defeated and no subsequent amendment were moved, we could be discussing on Thursday morning the stand part debate on clause 1 without having any way of indicating how far we agreed or disagreed with proposals of the Government in so far as they are contained in that.

I suggest that that is a very important matter and certainly a matter which should not be discussed in the absence of the Minister of Transport. It is crucial that we seek to clear up this matter and I suggest that there is a simple way in which</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>

	<p>the Minister could help us in this. He can indicate where is his precedent for a clause such as this, a clause which is not capable of amendment, which defines certain purposes of the Bill and which allows the Minister to be the sole judge. If he believes that he can come here as the sole judge he is disregarding a far more important parliamentary tradition than the one that he has already referred.</p>

	<p>A very important parliamentary tradition is bound up in this, a tradition which states that hon. Members of a Standing Committee will not be required to accept a Minister's judgment in his absence on a matter as important as this and I think this needs to be settled before we come to a conclusion on this amendment.</p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Minister did not do us the courtesy of addressing himself to the main burden of the points which have been put to him. It ought to have been clear to him that we seek his presence when we are discussing clause 1, and if he is going to be at Cabinet meetings instead of being here we will not get his views. I should be grateful, therefore, if the Minister will explain why he thinks his presence is unnecessary when we are going to be debating this importnat clause.

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Transport Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call on the first amendment, I would like to remind the Committee that there is a money resolution in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the room. I should also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given in tabling amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 3, Schedule 1, Clauses 4 to 12, Schedule 2, Clauses 13 to 20, Schedule 3, Clauses 21 to 32, Schedule 4, Clauses 33 and 34, Schedule 5, Clauses 35 and 36, Schedule 6, Clauses 37 to 42, Schedule 7, Clauses 43 to 50, Schedule 8, Clauses 51 to 57, new Clauses, new Schedules and Schedule 9.—
	<i>Norman Fowler.</i>]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some inquiries about the form of the motion and it might centralise the discussion if I were to pose the first inquiry by relating it to an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move after "Schedule 4" to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"new clauses relating to Part I".</p></blockquote>
You will appreciate, Mr. Lamond, that this Bill divides into very distinct and different parts. Clauses 1 to 25, which constitute Part I, deal mainly with public service vehicles, car sharing and a whole number of related issues. Subsequent</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i>— Ayes 10, Noes 7.</p>

	<p>clauses in Part II and in the remaining Parts deal with different issues. They include the Government's declared policy of converting the National Freight Corporation to a Companies Act company, matters of railway pensions and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>If we are to have a sensible discussion about new clauses which relate to public service vehicle licensing, car sharing and related issues, it would follow far more logically if it took place at the end of the debate or Schedule 4 rather than at a later stage. I appreciate that there are other difficulties with the placing of other new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>The first point I would make is that there cannot be any real conceivable link between the new clauses that the Committee might want to consider affecting public service vehicle licensing and the new clauses which would follow clauses 51 to 57, or would link in with new schedules and Schedule 9, if that is the intention of the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>

	<p>If the Minister wanted to split earlier in the proceedings, we should certainly listen to any arguments in that respect. But it seems to me that the Bill logically divides between public service vehicle matters and other matters, after clause 35 and the related schedules.</p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be as helpful as I can. I suggest that the right hon.

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I turn to a second amendment which I wish to propose to the procedure motion. I do so with considerable regret, because I had hoped that we should have elicited from the Minister during our discussion, his reasons or his precedent for dealing with the first clause in the way he proposed. He has not done so, and I have to assume that the logic of the clause is that he considers it necessary that certain of the purposes of Part I are spelled out in a specific clause which is clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall know the total views of the Committee as to the purposes of Part I only when we have debated Part 1. I therefore submit that the logical time to take that clause is at the end, not at the beginning of Part 1. I appreciate that that might cause certain difficulties to the Minister in his preparation of the way in which he handles the Bill. If it is any consolation to him, I can only assure him that they will be as nothing compared to the difficulties which he has created for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite sure that a number of my hon. Friends, having made the points they have in relation to the way we are to consider the Bill, and realising as they now do that we shall be considering it in the absence of the Minister, will want to submit their own reasons for taking clause 1 at the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point I want to make at this stage is one of procedure and logic. I will return later to the specific wording of the amendment which achieves this and hope that between now and then the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
might intervene to make his position clear. May I ask you, Mr. Lamond, whether it is necessary, in order to keep the debate in order, to speak to an amendment to the procedure motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member may speak on the main Question which I assume he was doing, and of course he may move an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance Mr. Lamond. In that case I will confine my first remarks to the main Question but I am giving fair notice to you and to the Committee that in doing so I am seeking a response from the Minister which will enable us to frame a precise amendment to meet this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond but I must leave the right hon. Gentleman in no doubt that I would not want to accept what he is saying. If the subsections are left unamended and if we consider clause 1 at this stage, that in no way restricts the Committee's deliberations on the later clauses. Should the Committee decide to amend any of the later clauses of the Bill in a way that affects the opening clause, of course the necessary amendments will be made on Report. There is nothing unusual in that. I think that there would be very considerable difficulties if we were to start without looking at the preliminary clause which, as I have stated before, is there for the convenience of the Committee and of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask for your guidance on this matter, Mr. Lamond. The Minister has said that, if as a result of decisions on subsequent clauses, he judged it necessary to then amend new clause 1, those amendments would be made. Surely it would be for you, for your successor in the Chair, or for the Speaker in the House to judge whether such amendments can be made and are in order. As the amendments tabled up to now have not been considered to be in order, how can the Minister contend that there is an acceptable way of amending clause 1? We have been bending our minds to this matter over recent weeks and we have not discovered it? Surely this is a matter on which you guide us, Mr. Lamond. You will tell us no doubt, whether it will be possible to proceed in the way in which the Minister has indicated. That will greatly facilitate us in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
our consideration of this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any amendments made at the stage suggested by the Minister would be a matter for Mr. Speaker. I am not forming any judgment on how he would move on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I am considering moving the Adjournment of the Committee until we can go into the matter with Mr. Speaker. This is clearly crucial to the way in which the Bill is handled. The assumption of the Minister is of course important. We do not deny that there is logic in saying that one could pass into the other parts of the Bill and then go back and amend a clause to define the purposes, if there were any reason to suppose that there is such a mechanism. All the indications that we have now clearly point the other way that no such mechanism can be discovered. May I suggest that the Committee consider this point? One only has to look at the amendments which are tabled. There is an amendment of deletion which is apparently out of order. If we delete a part of the Bill, exactly that problem will arise. If the Committee in its wisdom decides that some deletion should be made during the proceedings on Part I, then of course it would be necessary, in order to have a logical Bill, that some deletion may be required in clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee decided to insert a new purpose into Part I a mechanism would have to be found to insert it also into clause 1, and such an attempt to define a mechanism here has not been acceptable to you, Mr. Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I made this point. I cannot say how Mr. Speaker will judge these matters, but in my view it would not be possible to amend this clause unless and until amendments have been made to the substantive clauses which follow. The position when it came before Mr. Speaker would be possibly that amendments had been made to the substantive clauses. Therefore, the position would be altered in that respect. At the moment no amendments have been made to the clauses following clause 1, and therefore, in my opinion, no amendments are possible in clause 1. But that position would not be the same when it came before Mr. Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful, Mr. Lamond. You have guided us very clearly indeed on two major considerations. You have made it clear that only Mr. Speaker can give us the indication of what amendments could be made to clause 1 as a consequence of amendments carried later in the Committee. Presumably we draw from that the implication that this is a matter for the Report stage of the Bill rather than for the Committee. On the other hand, of course, we, in dealing with the proceedings of the Bill in Committee, must have a regard for the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing which flows directly clearly from your most lucid ruling is that that would be a matter for Mr. Speaker because of the way in which the procedure motion is before us. Since it is proposed that we take clause 1 before the other clauses it is not possible for us in the Committee to deal with the amendments to clause 1. Therefore, I think this fully undermines the point we are now seeking to debate through you with the Minister as to the order of the clause. I very much hope that you will listen to submissions from my hon. Friends on this point because it seems to me quite fundamental and it would obviously be most unsatisfactory to proceed from this stage without fully clarifying the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I have been in the House for nearly 10 years, my experience in Committees has been limited. Most of my time has been in Europe, which has an entirely different Committee procedure. Nevertheless, it seems that my right hon. Friend has been making some powerful points which are gaining recognition in various parts of the Committee. We are faced with considerable difficulties—and we tried to explain this earlier—about how we might deal with a practice by which clause 1 sets out the purposes of the Bill. I think it has been accepted by the Minister in our first amendment to the procedure motion that it was logical and correct to accept our amendment that we deal with clauses that are relevant to Part I. One of the difficulties with the Bill—and it is common, perhaps, to others—is that it is split into sections. The explanatory and financial memorandum makes it clear that it is in different sections. Indeed, the proposal from the Minister on how we should deal with the procedures reflects the logical sense of the argument that the schedules relevant to the sections should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
be dealt with at the time when the arguments are fresh in our minds. It clearly makes good sense to do so, and the amendment accepted by the Minister and moved by my right hon. Friend was a further extension of that and was readily accepted by the Minister. If the logic of the argument is that amendments which are relative to that particular part should be discussed when those clauses are still fresh in Members' minds, I presume perhaps that later he may then entertain other amendments from this side of the House, whilst pursuing the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more difficult point—on which I should be grateful for advice—is the one which is made by my hon. Friend of the difficulties that we now find ourselves in with regard to the amendment. It does seem to me logical that clause 1, which outlines the purposes of the Bill, should be followed—as was suggested in the amendment—with the new clauses and schedules. Mr Lamond, you have ruled that this is the normal procedure with those Bills that have such defined purposes. I believe that not all Bills have them. I understood that such definitions, were always included in the title of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The title is only one sentence. It includes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"relating to public service vehicles"</p></blockquote>
The definition of what that actually means and the consequences which follow from it are to be found in clause 1. It seems that it has been accepted that amendments can be made to the clause. I was under the impression originally that it was not possible to amend it because it simply stated the purposes. Now we are informed that if clauses are struck out of this Bill in the course of the debate, inevitably to have a Bill that declared as a purpose something which the clauses did not allow to happen would be nonsense. Therefore, someone would allow such amendments to take part on Report. It seems a curious way of doing it. Perhaps one can add that such clauses should not be in our Bills, but as it is we are left with the problem with clause 1 (1)(b) stating one of the purposes and intentions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have ruled, Mr. Lamond, that the Speaker would be required on Report Stage to give a judgment on the amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
ments, consequential on what we did in Committee. Nevertheless it is difficult for us and I would very much like to hear further comments, both from the Minister and indeed perhaps from you as well, Mr. Lamond, in view of the comments that were made by my right hon. Friend about the procedures and the arguments he outlined justifying his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to remind the Committee that we are discussing the Question and there is no amendment for us to consider. Clause 1 is, in effect, a list of the contents of Part I. In my view, as I have already said, it would not be possible to amend the clause unless and until amendments have been made to the substantive clauses that follow. That means, of course, that once we have debated clause 1 on the stand part motion there is no going back. The position, of course, is that when the Bill reaches the Chamber again, on Report, the Speaker will select such amendments as he feels appropriate. Certainly, it would be within his jurisdiction to select amendments to clause 1 as a result of subsequent amendments in later clauses. At the present time it would not be possible to amend this clause until amendments have been made to substantive clauses which follow. I have not, therefore, selected any of the amendments tabled by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and his colleagues. It will be in order to have a broad general stand part debate about the purposes and ambit of Part I of the Bill in which the right hon. Gentleman will no doubt be able to refer to a number of the points he is concerned with in the amenments which have not been selected. I would hope, however, that hon. Members will not use the debate to go into too much detail on the individual purposes of Part 1 which will be more appropriately discussed when the relevant clauses are reached. As I say, clause 1 is, in effect, a list of contents, and substantive debates would be better held on the appropriate clauses which follow clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that, when the Committee discuss such new clauses, amendments will not be ruled out of order on the grounds that clause 1 has not been amended. The argument will not be used that, because clause 1 was not amended, amendments to subsequent clauses would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Lamond, for that very clear statement. The concluding remarks cover one of the difficulties in that it could have been argued that we had been defeated on this amendment and so we could not alter the context later because the purposes had clearly been defined. We are glad to receive your assurance about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like your guidance, Mr. Lamond, on a comment you made in the course of my remarks. I was referring to the procedure motion, and, obviously, it is relative to the matter of the amendments, as you have just pointed out. I made a specific point. If the logic of the argument was that the amendments selected were to include relevant new schedules or clauses—we have already put some down on part I—I presume that it is not the motion as it is for debate when you say there is no amendment because presumably we would want to amend the other provisions to make precisely the same point on parts II, III and IV. Or were you advising me that, because no amendments have been received, we are solely debating at this stage the procedure motion which has been moved by the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only deal with the question before the Committee, which is the procedure motion as it has been amended. If there are any further amendments which hon. Members would wish to make, I think they should understand that they should propose them now and I would be prepared to listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I seek your guidance, Mr. Lamond? The Long Title is not included in the procedure motion, and I wonder at what point one might move an amendment to the Long Title.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Bill is finished, and only then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have indicated to us, Mr. Lamond, that one of the reasons why certain amendments cannot be accepted to clause 1—and why we are, in my contention, in this difficulty over the way we should proceed—is because clause 1 is ostensibly a list of the contents of part I. This places me in great difficulty because I do not understand why, if part I is ostensibly a list of the contents, amendment No. 10 is not acceptable, because amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
ment No. 10 merely corrects a deficiency in clause 1 if clause 1 is regarded as a list of the contents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a further submission to make on this, but I would welcome your guidance on this point. If we are to take it, first of all, that the purpose of clause 1 is to list the contents, surely an amendment which corrects an inadequacy and states what is a content and a purpose would appear to be in order. I have not fully grasped your ruling, or your ruling has not given the summation of the reasons why amendments of this type would not be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised a point of substance in his remarks in looking at amendment No. 10. I would be prepared to look at my ruling on this matter again before Thursday, but I point that any debate arising on amendment No. 10 would be extremely narrow and that proper debate would be best. If members of the Committee wish to have a substantial debate on this matter it would be better raised on a later clause. Certainly, I should be prepared to look at that ruling with regard to amendment No. 10 because of the point mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder, Mr. Lamond, whether you can help me and maybe some other members of the Committee. It seems that the next move will be to go on to the clause 1 stand part debate. If that is the case what will happen if no amendments are taken to clause 1, and if clause 1 is then agreed to. By that method, what we have agreed should be in the Bill is unamendable. In other words, we cannot add something to the Bill or delete from it because we cannot carry an amendment to clause 1. How, after clause 1, will we carry on to the subsequent clauses when maybe—with a little bit of luck, or maybe a little bit of help from our friends—an amendment is carried which substantially puts something into the Bill which is not in the clause 1 definition? Would we have to go back to clause 1? That would not make sense.

I should be grateful for your guidance, Mr. Lamond, because that is necessary to the way in which we frame an amendment and new clauses. Having decided the definition and the contents—and that is what clause 1 is about—how then do we frame an amendment or a new clause when the definition of everything that is contained in the Bill has already been decided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had made that clear. Clause 1 is a list of contents of part I. Certainly, once we have accepted that clause 1 should stand part of the Bill, there is no going back to amend it in Committee. But that will not rule out any amendments on the grounds that clause 1 did not list them as originally drafted. Hon. Members, therefore, need not feel restricted in that way. Of course, there are many other reasons for ruling amendments out of order, but certainly that will not be one reason used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any inconsistencies in the Bill when it leaves the Committee will be corrected, I expect, on Report, when I am sure that Mr. Speaker will listen very attentively to any proposals that are made which are presumed necessary to render the Bill coherent again. Therefore, I think that hon. Members really need have no fear on those grounds. I think their rights are covered and I think the question of whether the Bill would be in order at the end of the day is also covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

making it clear that you will consider carefully the point which I have submitted to you regarding amendment No. 10, which flows from your own guidance to us that, for purposes of determining whether amendments are in order, a major factor to be considered is whether clause 1 fully represents the contents of part I. But it flows from that, does it not, that the argument that we could submit as to that is very much a matter of fact? Either a matter is in the Bill or it is not. We could undoubtedly show that the provision of an appeal against a refusal by the London Transport Executive is in the Bill and is in part I. So that would not be a matter of argument. Therefore, can I put it to you that what must be a matter of argument relates to purposes, and how one distinguishes between what is a purpose and what is part of the content only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
