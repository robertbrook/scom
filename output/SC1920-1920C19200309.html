	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must wait for the Minister. The hour was fixed at eleven o'clock in consultation with Sir Robert Home, and I understood that it met his convenience and wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. BARRAND</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that we adjourn, as a protest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we had better wait for the Minister. I have communicated with him to the effect that we would like him to attend as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. BARRAND</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some form of protest ought to be made against a Minister failing to attend, and the only form of protest is to adjourn the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has not begun. You cannot adjourn it until you have commenced proceedings. The Minister is on his way now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. JONES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will move the adjournment, we will support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir B. STANIER</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that in the Votes the time of the meeting of the Committee was given as 11.30?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The CHAIRMAN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It was a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir B. STANIER</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A printer's error I suppose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of LABOUR (Sir Robert Home)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to express my great regret for the lateness of my arrival It was due to an unfortunate error in the papers issued from the Vote Office this morning which declared that the Committee was to meet at 11.30 instead of eleven o'clock. I took that as indicating
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that a change had been made at the last moment. I regret very much that I should have kept anyone waiting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>CLAUSE 1 (

	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>(Persons to be. insured to unemployment benefit.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>Every person who being insured under this Act becomes unemployed and in whose case the conditions laid down by this Act (in this Act referred to as "statutory conditions") are fulfilled shall be entitled, subject to the provisions of this Act, to receive payments (in this Act referred to as "unemployment benefit"), at weekly or other prescribed intervals, at such rates and for such periods as are authorised by or under the Second Schedule to this Act so long as the statutory conditions continue to be fulfilled and so long as he is not disqualified under this Act for the receipt of unemployment benefit.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move to leave out the word "becomes" ["becomes unemployed"] and to insert instead thereof the word "is."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a purely drafting Amendment. The draftsman takes the view that it makes the position clearer to use a simple word rather than a word which indicates the operation of becoming unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment agreed to</p>

	<p>CLAUSE, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>CLAUSE 3 (
	<i>Exemptions</i>) ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</section>

	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 4.</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>â€”(Power to extend Act to excepted employments.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>(1) The Minister may with the approval of the Treasury, by order provide for including among the persons employed within the meaning of this Act any persons engaged in any of the excepted employments specified in Part II. of the First Schedule to this Act, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order.</p>

	<p>(2) Before any such order is made a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than twenty days during which the House is sitting, and if either House, before the expiration of that period presents an Address to His Majesty against the draft or any part thereof, no further proceedings shall be taken thereon, but without prejudice to the making of any new draft order.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. WILLIAMS (Clerk)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> read the Resolution of the House of 5th March as follows:â€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"That, for the purposes of any Act of the present Session to amend the Law in respect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0005">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
of insurance against unemployment, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by Parliament of a contribution towards the cost of unemployment benefit and any other payments to be madeout of the unemployment fund established under the Act, and also of such other sums as may be required for making any other payments (not being made payments in respect of the cost of unemployment benefit or of benefits payable under any supplementary scheme) as may be authorised under the Act:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that the contribution towards the cost of unemployment benefit and other payments aforesaid shall not exceed one-third of the aggregate amount of the contributions which would be received from employers and employed persons in any year if those contributions were at the rate in the case of men of six pence and in the case of women of five pence per week, or at such higher rates not exceeding in the case of men eight pence and in the case of women seven pence, as may be fixed under any provisions of the Act for securing the solvency of the unemployment fund or relating to the periodical revision of the rates of contribution."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in Sub-section (1), after the word "Act" ["First Schedule to this Act"] to insert the words "or any class or description of the persons so engaged."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of this Amendment is to make provision to the effect of excepting not merely a whole trade where that is thought advisable but also to give an opportunity of excepting parts of a trade. For example, at the present time agriculture is exempted from the Bill. This Clause gives an opportunity of bringing in an exempted employment, but it would be unfortunate if that were to infer that the whole employment of agriculture, including forestry and horticulture, could only be brought in as one whole, when in point of fact you might wish to bring in one portion of so great an industry as agriculture without bringing in it all. The intention of the Amendment, accordingly, is to provide that there may be brought into the Bill not merely one of the excepted employments referred to in the Bill but also any class or description of the persons so engaged in any employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel A. MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman explain how any branch of an employment would be brought within the scope of the operation? Would it be by order of the Minister, or would legislation be necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is provided for in a later Clause of this Bill. The pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
vision is that it is to be by Order, an Order to be laid on the table of the House, to which objection may be taken, so that the matter really comes before Parliament before the Order can be pronounced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</section>

	<div class='clause'>CLAUSE 5.</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>â€”(Contributions by Employed Persons, Employers, and the Treasury.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, after Sub-section (4), to insert the following new Sub-section:
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) The Minister shall, on the application of any employer made in the prescribed manner within two months after the termination of any calendar year or other prescribed period of twelve months or after such longer time as the Minister may prescribe, refund to such employer as soon as practicable out of the unemployment fund the sum of three shillings in respect of each workman in respect of whom he has paid not less than forty-five contributions during the period of twelve months.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
which any refund of contributions is to be made under the foregoing provisions, or for the purpose of making provision for any period which may elapse between the date on which contributions commence to be payable under this Act and the date on which the first period for the refund of contributions under the foregoing provisions commences the Minister may, so far as necessary for the purpose, apply the provisions of this sub-section to any period less than twelve months, subject to such proportionate reduction of the number of contributions required as the Minister directs, and this sub-section shall take effect as regards any such period of less than twelve months as so applied.</p></blockquote>
The Clause which I propose to add reproduces practically the same words as the Sub-section in the National Insurance Act. On the Second Heading the right hon. Gentleman stated that this scheme of refunding 3s. had been left out of the present Bill as he did not think that the inducement to provide constancy of employment was a necessity. It seems to me, and those whom I represent, essential to keep before us the necessity for providing against unemployment when it exists and, though the inducement may not have had quite such an effect as was hoped, yet we should do everything to encourage prevention rather than cure. For these reasons I urge strongly that these words should be there added.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is very-important that we should do everything we can to prevent unemployment and give an inducement to employers to keep men at employment rather than allow to go out of work men who, with some little zeal upon the part of the employer, could be kept at work. The Clause which the hon. and gallant Member has moved is in terms a repetition of Clause 94 of the previous Unemployment Act. That Clause was enacted with the intention to which the hon. and gallant Member has referred, but it has been entirely futile for that purpose. If he considers it he will see that it offers no possible inducement to an employer to continue a man at work rather than discharge him. The proposal is that the employer should be given 3s. a year in respect of each man for whom he has paid forty-five contributions in the year. It offers no inducement to an employer to keep a man on even for an extra day if you offer him 3s. a year for a man costing 15s. a day to employ. However good the object you cannot achieve it by this method. The fact is that you could not except at the most
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
inordinate expense offer an inducement to an employer which would be sufficient, in works of any dimensions at all, to induce him to keep on men when work became scarce. There must be some other inducement, either affecting his own pocket or his view of public philanthropy, or the interest that he takes in the personal welfare of his men, towards keeping employment going at a time when perhaps it is difficult, but you can never induce an employer by simply paying him 3s. a year for a man who costs him many shillings a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past it has cost Â£118,000 a year to pay the employers the money which they were entitled to under the section of the previous statute, and that Â£118,000 has been spent absolutely without result. At that time there were only 1,500,000 people insured. The provision did not apply to the extended insurance scheme of 1916. It only covered the original 1,500,000 who were insured under the initial Act. Accordingly there is to that extent precedent for not pushing it further or keeping it alive now. We propose now to insure 12,000,000 people altogether, and instead of costing Â£118,000 a year this would cost according to our calculations at least Â£600,000 a year, which would wipe out the whole balance of your fund. The result would be that you would have to put up the contributions of employers and workmen to give the benefit which we at present provide. So far from this 3s. allowance to employers producing any beneficial result, it would only lead to a more expensive scheme for workmen and employers without any corresponding advantage. I hope therefore that the hon. and gallant Member will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this Amendment is to enable men who are still working, but are over seventy years of age, to continue their payments to the Unemployment In surance Fund. It may seem a very small matter, and I do not want to be charged with dealing with it in any parochial sense, but in many industries there are still employed many men who are over seventy years of age. I will give my own experience in connection with the colliery at which I worked. There must be employed there something like 20 men who are over 70 years of age. They are fairly hale and hearty and are doing very good work indeed. We had no fewer than eight men over 70 years of age employed on the picking belts at that particular colliery. What applies in the instance of this particular colliery must apply to a very considerable extent elsewhere. I feel certain that if hon. Members recognised this fact they would pause before saying that such men must cease to be contributors and cease to receive the benefits of this fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is one which probably would excite the sympathy of most of us. The case of the man over 70 years of age who is still able to work undoubtedly deserves the best consideration, and, indeed, we have given that consideration to the particular arguments which the hon. Member has put before the Committee. The matter, however, is much more complicated and difficult than is represented by such instances as he adduces. What has been the experience of friendly societies in relation to men over 70? It is that it really becomes impossible to distinguish between the cases in which a man is either ill or unemployed through incapacity and the cases in which he is unable to work or to move about owing to the ordinary debilitation of age. Accordingly
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the matter becomes an entirely practical one. Whatever provision legislatively may be made, or ought to be made, for people over the age of 70, it cannot very well be done in this fashion, because what insurance becomes under such a provision as this is really an adjunct of the old age pension. You may say, if you like, that people ought to get larger sums in the way of pensions than they get now. That is an entirely different matter. In practice it really does prove impossible to distinguish between cases where a man is unemployed through old age and where he is unemployed through the vicissitudes of trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir FORTESCUE FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the cessation of contribution, as proposed by the hon. Member, necessarily mean the cessation of benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would under the Bill as we propose it. We intend not only that he shall cease to contribute, but that he shall cease to receive benefit. The two things follow. We take it the hon. Member means to move, if this provision is excised, that there should be inserted a provision that the man over 70 should get his benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. GRUNDY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My view, perfectly frankly, is that in practice it is almost impossible to work out a system in such a way. The same considerations have moved those who dealt with the question of insurance against ill-health. There the man over 70 gets no advantage, in the shape of money benefit, under the National Health Insurance Act. Prior to the age of 70 he gets 10s. in case of being invalided; after 70 years of age that contribution ceases for precisely the same consideration as I have now put before the Committee. With the best will in the world and with every wish to meet the case of a man over 70, we have felt bound to eliminate from our Bill any provision for him under Unemployment Insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. FLANNERY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the very lucid and attractive explanation of my right hon Friend the Minister for Labour, I confess that I am far from convinced that the Government view is the correct view. It seems to me that the great object which this Bill has is not to pay compensation for unemployment so much as to assist in maintaining employ-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
ment, but, where employment is impossible, to give some benefit which will not restrain the beneficiary from seeking new employment. There is nothing in this Bill which either in intention or in fact will prevent or restrain a man from seeking re-employment. That is surely right. What is wanted is to encourage men to be in employment and not to discourage them. I know that there are many men of 70 years of age who are nearly as capable of a day's work as ever they were and are still performing it. Are you going to shut out those men altogether from the benefit of this Bill? Are you going to throw them upon the Old Age Pension? That is why the 70 years of age limit is fixed. It seems to me that if you could provide some elasticity in this clause it would be better. Possibly there could be arrangements made for a medical certificate of a Medical Board, or something of that kind, whereby the man who at 70 years of age is as capable as many others at 60 of doing his work should be able to continue at work and should not by implication of this Bill be thrown on to the Old Age Pension system. I am sure it would be for the public interest that such persons should be encouraged to continue their lives of usefulness and employment for as long after 70 years of age as is possible. There is no practical difficulty, it seems to me, in this suggestion of a Medical Board or of a man renouncing his Old Age Pension benefit if he has been passed by a Board as capable of working. It would maintain a feeling of industry and the desire to do the best for industry after the War that we all wish to encourage among the workers as well as among the employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When I arrived I was informed that the meeting had commenced at 11 o'clock, and I have been deprived of the opportunity of moving my Amendment. I want to know what I am to do in the circumstances.

	<div class='member'>Mr. T. THOMSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support the very able appeal made by the hon. Baronet to the Government to reconsider their decision on this particular Amendment. I understand from what the right hon. Gentleman said that in principle he did not raise much objection; in fact, it had his sympathy, as Amendments so often have from the Government, when they are going to reject them. I do hope the hon. Baronet's suggestion may enable the Government to reconsider the matter. We understand that the one thing of importance at the present time is to increase production, and I submit, with all respect, that to increase production you require to keep as many men at work after 70 as possible. By this Amendment you would achieve the very object, which the Government say is an all-important one, of increasing, output in industry. With regard to the practical difficulty, seeing that the difference between the unemployment benefit and the old-age pension at to-day's basis of prices is not so considerable, there would not be so great an inducement to a man to take the Unemployment Benefit when incapable of work, and I think the suggestion of a medical certificate, or some other means, which it ought not to be beyond the ingenuity of the Government to devise, might enable them to accept in principle, and in fact, this very desirable Amendment, in order to increase the output of our industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. ROSE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is just one phase of the matter which I think has been overlooked by the Committee. There will be, if this Amendment be not accepted, the possibility of very grave injustice. A man might pay contributions but never receive Unemployment Benefit for ten years. He comes to the age of 70, and the whole of his contributions are lost, and he is not entitled to anything. We think that is one phase of the matter which ought to be considered. The right hon. Gentleman suggested that this is an addition to pension. It is nothing of the kind. There was never any benefit-paying union that paid two benefits at the same time. A man does not get this and a pension as well. What it does mean is that a man who has passed the age of 70, and who is free in respect of his contributions, shall draw his 15 weeks, or whatever number of weeks the Bill ultimately
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
determines. If he cannot get back to work, then he qualifies for the old age pension; but if a man has qualified by his contributions, and has reached 70 years of age, he ought not to be deprived of his fights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. CAPE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In rising to support the Amendment, I would join with other Members in asking the Minister of Labour to reconsider his opposition to the Amendment. I think it will be a gross injustice to men over 70 if we do not allow them to pay their insurance contributions, and also to receive insurance benefit if they are thrown out of work. May I give an instance or two of men belonging to my own Union? They were men engaged on a by-product plant, and, owing to shortage of transport facilities, these men were suspended for six or eight weeks. Three out of eight men were over 70 years of age, and we paid them benefits out of our Union. They did not come on the Old Age Pension scheme. They have now gone back to work, two of them resuming last week, and one to-day. Consequently these men will continue again to pay their insurance contributions, and if this Subsection is struck out they will ultimately fall in to pay their contributions to the Unemployment Insurance scheme. Surely there are a good many people in this country who, according to age, are entitled to Old Age Pension, but because of the vitality and the energy they possess they are working on, and are not receiving the Old Age Pension. Surely we ought to give these people the right of what I call free-citizenship. Otherwise contributions may be paid a large number of years, and when men are over 70, although still following their occupation, they will be immediately cut off, and all they have paid be lost. Consequently, I think it will be a very grave injustice to these men if the right hon. Gentleman does not accede to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. JESSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my appeal to the Minister of Labour to accept this Amendment. I have a case in mind of a man over 80 years of age, who is working just as hard and regularly as a man half the age.

	<div class='member'>Mr. CAIRNS</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will accept the Amendment of my hon. Friend. In the constituency I represent we have large numbers of active men between 70 and 80 years of age. On our screens the major portion of the men working are men over 70. I suppose some of these men will have paid from the age of 50 or 60 threepence a week, or whatever the sum may be. Will that money be refunded when they attain the age of 70 if this Bill becomes law? It will be very hard if it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel MURRAY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Minister whether, in considering this Amendment, as no doubt he did before he came to the Committee, he formed any conclusion as to what the charge would be to the Exchequer if this Sub-section were withdrawn. I think that is a very material point, and, before making up my mind how to vote, I should be very glad if the Minister would inform the Committee whether he has considered that point. I have been much impressed by the arguments that have been used in supporting this Amendment. There is the difficulty, which has been alluded to by the hon. Baronet, but that, no doubt, could be got over by the Medical Board, to which he also made reference. One, of course, can see the Minister's difficulty in accepting the Amendment now, but could he give the Committee an assurance that he would consider this favourably and sympathetically with a view, perhaps, of accepting some such Amendment as this on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. GALBRAITH</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do hope that the Minister will give this his reconsideration, for I feel that this strikes at the very foundations of liberty and the right of the workman. We all know that there

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
are men younger at 70 than some at 60. Why should an old man, who is willing to do service for himself and the State, be compelled, because he has arrived at the age of 70, to cease his contributions? The ultimate result would be that he would withdraw from labour, and go on to the State funds. I know hundreds of men over 70 who are working. There are lots of Members in this House over 70 who would feel it 
	<i>infra dig</i> if they were compelled to yield up their membership because they have the misfortune to be 70. My mother, at the age of 92, is much younger than lots of women I know under that age, and she is still willing to work, and not willing to go on to the State, for at the age of 92, rather than be idleâ€”for in industry there lay plenty, and in idleness there lay povertyâ€”she earned last July, for two weeks, 13s. 8d. Now why force anyone at the age of 70, willing to help himself and the State, to go on to a fund that would give him less means of livelihood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Captain FITZROY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite realise the difficulties of the Minister in accepting this Amendment without further consideration, but I do hope he will give it further consideration before finally turning it down. I do not quite understand his argument that, if he were to accept this Amendment it would tend to drive men on to the Old Age Pension, or, at any rate, have an inducement that way. It seems to me it would tend to keep people off the Old Age Pension, and I think it is a very desirable thing that men over 70 years of age, who are still in a physical condition, should be encouraged to work. This, I understand, is a contributory scheme, and, if a man ceases to pay, he will be entitled to the Old Age Pension. I know that this Bill does not apply to the agricultural industry. Of course there are more men employed in agriculture over 70 than in any other industry, and it is very important that we should, if we can, retain the services of these men, who are sometimes among the most competent of agricultural labourers, as long as we possibly can. There is another consideration. The income limit which entitles a man to the Old Age Pension is not a very large one. If he be just above it, and can do a good many days' work, then if he ceases to be employed he has to fall back entirely upon his own resources; whereas, if he comes under this Bill at
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
70, and is, from physical disability or other reason, prevented from continuing his ordinary occupation, then he will be entitled to whatever benefit he gets from this Bill. For all these reasons, I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter before turning it down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. KIDD</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact, as has been pointed out, that there are a large number of men at 70 who are fit to work, and, what is more important, willing to work. They are likely to be in constant employment at 70; and, in fact, a man's fitness and willingness at the age of 70 is rather conclusive proof that such a man has never been a burden to that insurance fund to which he has contributed. Therefore, I sympathise with the hon. Member who suggests the possibility that some compromise should enable the Minister at least to make some provision to compensate the man for his competency at work and his constancy of payment up to that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am very greatly impressed by the arguments put forward by various Members. These considerations were not absent from my mind at the time we took the course of making the provision to which exception is taken. There are some matters which were not clearly before me which have certainly been very impressively brought home to me in the discussion. The difficulties with which we are confronted I do not think have been entirely understood, although the discussion has shown clearly an appreciation of the position. It is not the kind of man who has been hale and well and is doing a good day's work who causes so much difficulty in drawing the line of demarcation to which I referred, as the man who is "on" and "off," and who really does supplement his Old Age Pension because he is not able to earn enough to bring him above the limit which excludes him from the right to an Old Age Pension. That is the man who is the difficulty. It was his case, which both those who supervise the Health Insurance and those who have advised me about Unemployment Insurance put forward, that induced us to take the view we have done. It has been suggested there may be ways of meeting that difficulty. I certainly should like to take the opportunity of considering what might be devised to meet the troubles with which we have been met in the past. I

promise to reconsider the whole matter before the Report stage, if the Committee be willing. Replying to the hon. and gallant Gentleman (Lieut.-Col. A. Murray) as to the cost of this addition, it will roughly amount, so far as we can make out, to Â£500,000, an appreciable amount, which was one of the considerations which undoubtedly weighed with us. I shall have to reconsider the whole case in conjunction with my financial advisers. In this connection I shall, among other considerations, have to deal with those who are presenting the new Bill in connection with National Health Insurance To some extent they are linked up with the provisions we are making for Unemployment Insurance. I do not wish to regard these difficulties as insuperable, although I think they are formidable; but I undertake to give the matter further consideration, and, to use a word which is sometimes abused, I am "sympathetic" towards the suggestion which has been made, and shall desire to take every opportunity to translate that sympathy into practical results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I also desire, at the end of the Subsection, to insert the words "or as from such prior date as the Court of Appeal may, with the concurrence of the person, or class of persons concerned, determine" My manuscript Amendment deals with a comparatively small matter, but it is one that ought to have the consideration of the Minister and Members of this Committee. The Sub-section deals with the case in which the Minister has decided against an individual being an insured person, and in which, on appeal, the decision goes against the Minister. The present provision seems to me to be a possible hardship for the insured person; benefit is received only after the payment of some 12 contributions. There is an Amendment on the Paper to raise that 12 to 26. I think it quite possible the person who

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
really should be insured, but who has been kept outside the Act for the time being owing to the decision of the Minister, might lose benefits by not having made the full number of contributions, either 12, 26, or whatever the number decided. The insured person should at least have the option of deciding whether he will come under the Act as from the date of Appeal, or possibly from the date he made the application to be enrolled.

The proposal in the Bill is that people should be regarded as insured where there is a question of doubt about it, as from the date at which the Court of Appeal, if it has been appealed to, gives its decision. In the case, however, where the Minister's view is upheld the insurance is as from the date of the Minister's decision; on a reversal it is from the date of the decision of the Court of Appeal. There may be some anomaly in these two cases, but, in point of fact, what the hon. Member proposes would not, I think, lead to any practical result at all. He assumes the Judge of the Court of Appeal can enter into a bargain with the people whose interests are involved. I do not think it is possible for the Judge in coming to a decision to make a bargain with one of the litigants as to the date referred to. While I think the hon. Member makes a point, I am afraid we cannot make any alteration in the sense he desires. It might be possible to make the decision run from such a date as the Court of Appeal may fix, leaving the matter entirely to that Court. I do not think it would be possible to make the duration of the Insurance run as from some date which the Court of Appeal arranges with a certain amorphous body of people before it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment has been put down with design. A very great deal depends upon it in the subsequent stages of the Bill, the general principle of which is the number of weeks' contribution that is to determine a worker's entitlement to benefit. We want twelve altered into twenty-six weeks. The first general reason we have for suggesting this is that all the experience of Trade Union bene-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
fits, and some of us may claim to have very considerable experience, is that there should be, and must be if your scheme is to be financially sound, a considerable probationary period before which you cannot reasonably be expected to pay the benefits. The Committee will be aware that most benefit-paying Trade Unions have 12 months as the probationary period, during which members are said to be non-free. They become free after paying 12 months' or 52 weeks' contributions and levies. The suggestion we make is that as the man or worker on benefit gets only one week for every six weeks' contributions, it means, and particularly in the case of many casual workers, that he will never get any benefit at all. If a man has paid 12 weeks he is only entitled to two weeks' Unemployment Benefit, but he may be out of work a great deal more than two weeks. We do not think that is financially sound that after a man has paid contributions for only 12 weeks into the Fund he should be entitled to benefit. We think, also, that during the first 12 months' operations of this Act the general industrial outlook is of such a character that it does not seem to us to offer any sort of doubt as to the amount that will have to be paid for Unemployment Benefit We expect that during the next 12 or 18 months there will not be any very acute unemployment. In subsequent stages we shall have to offer other Amendments to the Committee largely based on this Amendment. It is only the general principle that is laid down in this Amendment, namely, that there should be a longer probationary period before any worker contributing to the Fund should be entitled to benefit. We do not think that the payment of 12 weeks' contributions is a sufficient security for the Fund itself:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems somewhat strange that the Minister should be resisting an Amendment which is intended to put his scheme on a more sound financial basis. When I saw the Amendment on the Paper, I consulted again my financial advisors on this matter as to whether it was necessary to take the precaution suggested in this Amendment, and they advised me that the hon. Member's proposal errs on the side of undue caution, which one would expect, of course, from a Scotsman, especially from a Scotsman from Aberdeen. One of
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
my chief desires in connection with this measure has been to get it into operation as quickly as possible. To fix a period of 26 weeks as the qualifying term seems to me to postpone for too long the benefits which one hopes the Act will confer, and, since we are assured that the scheme is financially sound on the basis of a 12 weeks' qualifying period, there is no necessity to make people wait for any longer period. Accordingly I desire to give them benefit at an earlier period rather than a later period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. BELL</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is evidently overlooking the fact that we are asking for something far more generous later on. We recognise that we cannot possibly do that without seeking to increase the finance of the Bill. We look upon it in this sense, that after 12 weeks' contributions the man is only entitled to two weeks' unemployment benefit, and then he is disqualified. He cannot receive any more benefit although he may be unemployed for a considerable period. He can only receive one week's benefit for each six weeks' contribution, so that at the end of 12 weeks' contribution he is only entitled to two weeks' benefit. Later on we seek to delete that Clause so that after 26 weeks' contribution the man shall not be disqualified after receiving two weeks' benefit; but if he continues to be unemployed the benefit will still be there for him. It is because we want to help the man who is really out of work and is suffering in consequence of his unemployment that we wish to extend the qualifying period to 26 weeks, and to increase the finance of the Bill to such an extent. By doing that we shall assist the man later on when he is out of work for a lengthened period, rather than knocking him out of benefit simply because he has drawn one week's benefit for each six weeks' contributions paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Under the provisions of the Bill one of the qualifications for the receipt of Unemployment Benefit is that the applicant must, if he has been required by an insurance officer, in pursuance of Regulations made under this Act, to attend at any course of instruction approved by the Minister for the purposes of this provision, prove that he duly attended in accordance with the requirement. A question was raised by the Board of Education upon this matter, since it is their function to attend to matters dealing with instruction, to the effect that consultation should be had with them before these courses of instructions were arranged. Accordingly, to meet their point of view, which I regard as a right and expedient one, I propose this Amendment. Sub-section (5) would then read

This Amendment raises a question that was referred to on the Second Reading, to which I hope the Committee will give sympathetic consideration. It raises a most important issue, and what in many places is a controversial question In whatever form this Bill emerges from the Committee or the House it will give little satisfaction to the great mass of trade unionists and workmen, unless provision is made whereby Unemployment Benefit can be paid to men who are out of work owing to trade disputes for which they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
are in no way to blame. We do not say that an Insurance Law such as this should take sides in a trade dispute or provide money for men who are engaged in the trade. What we ask is that Unemployment Benefit shall be paid to a man who is in a state of unemployment through no fault of his own, but is the victim of action by some other body of workmen or a particular employer or association of employers. Strikes, lockouts and anything in the nature of trade disputes, are not always due to the action of workmen. They are sometimes due to a combination of causes that have produced a condition of conflict between the two parties, and sometimes to action taken by the employer of labour or an association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause as it stands is a Clause to disqualify men. We agree that men who are engaged in a dispute, who cease work, who are on strike, who are themselves the cause of unemployment, should be disqualified from this benefit, but where other men are stopped, either directly or indirectly, through the action of somebody else, they are victims, and in no way combatants, and therefore have a claim under this Bill. As we can all agree as to who should be disqualified, we should also be able to agree as to who should not be disqualified. No doubt the Minister of Labour would say that it is extremely difficult in these matters to decide who is and who is not a combatant. I agree that there are administrative difficulties, but those difficulties exist, and have to be settled now. The existing law requires, and this Bill will require, to identify the man who is entitled to benefit and the man who is not. In practice I should say that officials can just as well say who is entitled, as they can now say who is not entitled, to benefit. In that way the administrative difficulties can be overcome by those who have the responsibility of dealing with this Bill. This Bill would impose special hardship upon the class of workers who can least afford to be out of work owing to trade disputes. I refer to the less skilled men and the less paid men, the labourers. They are the men who when in work have the least opportunity of providing for the rainy day, and are the least likely to be able to face and live through a period of disputes. And yet they are the men who by this Clause in its present form stand not
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
merely to suffer most, but to suffer more often than other workmen, because of trade disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a rule the labourer stands to fall between the two stools. The employer may take action against his skilled workers, and thereby cause a dispute, and the labourer is stopped on that account, or the skilled man, in combination with his skilled fellows, may take action which is the cause of a dispute. In both cases the labourer stands to lose, and he is in the position of there being two chances to one against him, as compared with workers of a different scale of labour. The recent moulders' dispute, which unhappily lasted so long, is so fresh in the minds of hon. Members that I do not think it necessary to labour the case which I am now presenting. I may recall that on three occasions the moulders were advised by their leaders to settle on certain terms, and rejected a settlement. We need not here consider whether they did right or wrong. What we have to consider is the state of many, many thousands of men who were thrown out of work, directly or indirectly, as a result. It is possible that the Minister of Labour knows how strong is the feeling of unemployed men who were not members of the trades covered by the law, and who got no Unemployment Benefit. We know that if this Amendment were accepted there would have to be provision, perhaps a little bolder and more extensive than the provision of the Bill as it now is, but if hon. Members agree with the argument which I now put forward, they will agree further that the finances of the Bill should be made so that these classes may be brought within the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Finally, I submit that if this Amendment were accepted it would not have the effect, as some have feared, of provoking disputes or causing men to enter into quarrels more light-heartedly than, perhaps, they do now. It will not have the effect of causing or prolonging disputes. Indeed, the moulders' dispute is again an instance. That dispute lasted seven months, in spite of there being no provision to pay benefit to the enormous number of men who were suffering. I submit that on its merits this is a just claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman has said, this matter was before the House on the Second Read-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
ing, and the arguments now adduced were stated by him to the House. I do not think there is anything new to be said upon the subject. I appreciate entirely the point of view of those who say that considerable hardship is suffered by men who, through no fault of their own, are put out of work during a strike. We had a very clear example of such circumstances in the case of the moulders' strike. I think it very likely that many people entirely innocent suffered great hardship because of that strike. The difficulty is to find any really logical and practical way of dealing with this matter, except the one we have adopted. We have not adopted it without experience. It is the solution that was set out in the last Unemployment Insurance Act. At that time the matter was debated with just as much point as now. The theories set against each other were something like these: On the one hand it was said that in the case of a strike everybody of the same trade throughout the country who was put out of work by that strike should suffer hardship and get nothing at all, and, coming down to more detailed application of that principle, that everyone in the same type of factory in the same town, put out of work by that strike, should receive no benefit. The other theory was the one which the right hon. Gentleman urges, namely, that no one who is not actually on strike himself should be deprived of benefits. The solution ultimately come to was this compromise, and we have acted on it ever since. If people go on strike in one establishment by reason of which an establishment across the road is put out of work, the establishment across the road does not suffer; still further, if people are engaged in one establishment, but the work is so clearly delimited that you have different sections, the strike of one section will not deprive of benefit people who may be put out of work in other sections completely different. What the right hon. Gentleman asks is not merely that, but that people who are working actually in the same shop, and along with the people who are on strike, should receive benefit. For exampleâ€”and this is the case which has brought the matter home to the minds of everyoneâ€”the moulders' labourer, who was out of work owing to the action of the moulder, should not be deprived of the benefit. if they themselves were not on
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
strike. Here is the difficulty. It is very clearly pointed by the attempt of my right hon. Friend to meet it. He proposes that this Section should now read
	<br><blockquote><p>"An insured contributor who has lost employment by the withdrawal of his labour in order to participate in a trade dispute"â€”</p></blockquote>
shall be deprived of benefit. How are you going to decide who are the men who have actually withdrawn labour to participate in a trade dispute? Would you pay benefit to non-union moulders in a case of a moulders' strike or to anyone who could say, "I am not really participating in the strike. My union may have decreed it, but I do not want it; I do not like it; I want to go on working. I am out of work only because my union has issued this decree." How are you going to decide which of the men are acting truthfully and honestly? That is one of the great difficulties. It goes further than that. It would be perfectly simple for any people who wanted to have a strike on the cheapest possible terms to bring out the key men and let all the others claim benefits. That is not such a very far-fetched idea, because not very long ago it was suggested in connection with a particular branch of industry, and, whether it is ever done or not, it is clearly open to great abuse. You cannot get any practical method of dealing with the matter other than that which has been in force since the previous Act and which we now propose to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. JONES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry that the right hon. Gentleman cannot see his way clear even to give reconsideration to the proposal of the Amendment. The Union with which I happen to be associated has had a very bitter experience in all the large disputes, because thousands of our men have been thrown out of work in consequence of those disputes, over which they had no control. Each Trade Union has its own method of government. The right hon. Gentleman seems to imagine, merely because men are working in a particular workshop, that if a dispute takes place it will not pay the employer to continue if the more important workmen leave and he will close the factory down, and thousands of men will be automatically thrown out of employment. How can you go to these men and ask them to consider legislation favourably, if of a character such as this,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
when the first thing they say to you is, "Yes, when we are thrown out of work through circumstances over which we have no control, thrown out in thousands at a time, we are absolutely barred, because it is cheaper?" That is the only argument as against the situation they find themselves in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the tendency of disputes today? The employers are well organised in their great federations, and the workmen are getting better organised in their great federations. The tendency now is for disputes to become larger, for greater numbers to become involved, and for employers to act together more than ever. The result is that thousands of our members are thrown on to the streets continually, sometimes for months. We cannot convince these men with the nice arguments advanced by the Minister that they are not entitled to receive benefits for which they claim they have paid. If they are not unemployed, what are they? They do not want to strike. They are out of work through the action of somebody else. Therefore they cannot be convinced that they are not justified in asking for consideration, even if it means increasing contributions. We say the great mass of workers can claim that it is an injustice to them to be placed in the position in which they now are placed, and we think some arrangement might be made whereby these men's case might be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a somewhat similar Amendment down, and, as I take it, it would not be advisable to have two discussions, I want to say a word or two on the principle. I think that the particular phrasing of this Amendment does not carry out what was said by the right hon. Member for Platting (Mr. Clynes), because I understood from his speech he would exclude men locked out by an employer in a definite trade dispute, and I take it they would not be excluded under his particular wording. But whether that is so or not, I should like to say a word with regard to the Minister's view. It seemed that again he was not unsympathetic to the principle, and that his opposition was due rather to the practical difficulties of carrying it out. He pointed to the illogical position that would arise, but I submit the present position is the most illogical. Reference has been made to the moulders' strike. When one finds in the same works that the labourers of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
foundry are out of work and get no benefit through the strike, and that the labourers in an adjoining departmentâ€”the engineeringâ€”who are thrown out of work on account of the same strike, receive Unemployment Benefit under this Bill, it is absolutely impossible to convince those labourers, who may be members of the same Union, that the labourer who happens to be in the engineering department should receive benefits, and the labourer working in the foundry department should not receive benefits. That is what will happen under this Bill. You could not have anything more illogical, and, therefore, on the ground of logic, I submit that the Minister has no case.

With regard to the difficulty as to nonunion men and key men, I suggest, it might be possible by reference to a Court of Arbitration, or some other machinery, which might be set up, that only the men whom it is desired to help should be helped. I appeal to the Minister to consider whether it is possible to devise machinery whereby those who are absolutely innocent in a dispute, and not parties to it one way or the other, might not be brought within the four corners of the Bill. He said this had already been discussed by the House and decided otherwise. I submit that the public conscience in these matters has developed very considerably since those days, and I think all of us, whatever view we take, realise that there is a very great responsibility on the whole community to assist those who are really innocent in matters of this sort. I do appeal to the right hon. Gentleman, therefore, to consider whether it is not possible in some way or other to bring in these men, because no one surely suggests that for the sake of 15s. a week men are going to prolong a strike because they happen to be included in the four corners of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. W. R. SMITH</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Minister to give some reconsideration to this matter. During the discussions in the House reference has been continually made to the fact that it is desirable to have in the minds of the general public a respect for this place as an institution, and to create a desire to look to it to adjust difficulties which arise from time to time. If that frame of mind be desirable in the country, then I think the Amendment ought to be accepted by the Minister in charge of this Bill, because at the present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
time many Trade Unions do pay Out-of-work Benefit. A very large number have evolved schemes of their own which have been in existence for a considerable period of time, and I do not know any Trade Union which adopts the arbitrary principle contained in this Bill. All Unions pay their members Out-of-work Benefit where a man is unemployed through no fault of his own, and it will not help legislation if you create in the mind of the worker the idea that what is absolutely fair and just under his own voluntary scheme of unemployed insurance, becomes impossible when legislation is effected upon this subject. The previous speaker emphasised the fact that this Amendment does not seek to establish a new principle, but is merely an extension of a principle. I would like to emphasise that point, because men, who may be working on different sides of a street, and may be living next door to each other, may both be affected by a dispute, and one can take Unemployment Benefit and the other cannot. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman in charge of this Bill will see how this kind of thing will rankle in the minds of those adversely affected as a very serious injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points raised as to the difficulty of administration can be met, I think, as was suggested by the Mover of the Amendment. The administration of Unemployed Insurance has been largely one of difficulty right from the very beginning, and, as experience has come along, means have been devised whereby the various difficulties can be met. In this respect, if not on the lines suggested, at least by some other method, it will be perfectly easy to lay down lines of demarcation between the man who is unemployed as the result of his own action, and the man who is unemployed through no fault of his own. The point about the non-unionist hardly has the application the right hon. Gentleman may think. He, at least, has an opportunity of having a voice in the question, and if he is a skilled worker in a foundry or a factory, he has the right of belonging to the Union which has got the question under consideration, which may develop into a strike or lockout. But the other man has no chance or opportunity. He is outside the thing entirely; he has no right to attend meetings at which these things are discussed. He is helpless right from the very beginning, and has no responsibility whatever for his unemployment, which might result from a
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
dispute in connection with another class of labour with whom he may be to some extent associated as an assistant. Having in mind these facts, I do hope the Minister will reconsider this point. Trade Unions, if left to themselves, by their own schemes have always solved the difficulties. There is no reason to introduce restrictive Regulations such as are in this Bill. Trade Unionism can do what is required in its voluntary schemes, and with much lower contributions for the rate of benefit in this Bill. If they can manage schemes on these lines, and keep their schemes solvent and satisfy the members it ought not to be impossible to do something of the kind in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Has it really considered the difficulty which has been presented to us? One wants to be perfectly fair, and to do all in one's power to meet the point raised by the right hon.

	<div class='member'>Major BARNES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would add a word to the appeal which has been made to the Minister to reconsider this point. So far as I understand it, there is no contest of principle; it is purely on the ground of the difficulty of administering the provision. That must be so. If the right hon. Gentleman was opposed in principle to the suggestion he would be opposed to the principle of the Bill. As he has told us, in the administration of the last Act the attempt is being continually made more and more accurately to ascertain just what people are out of employment through no fault of their own. The object of this Amendment is to push that sifting process a little further. In the two matters he put forward with regard to dealing with men in the same Union, and the keymen, the right hon. Gentleman is present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
ing a real point of substance in the difficulty of administration. After all, it is only a difficulty, and one cannot help feeling that some form of words might be found to meet it. I would ask him to give the Committee an assurance now that he will give this matter reconsideration between now and Report. My own position is that if the attitude of the right hon. Gentleman to-day is final I shall be obliged to vote for the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the appeal of the hon. and gallant Gentleman (Major Barnes) I will sayâ€”and I desire to be quite frank, for it is always better to be absolutely candid in a matter of this sortâ€”if I thought there was the slightest chance of my mind being altered between now and the Report stage I would willingly say that I would give the matter re-consideration. In point of fact I have given every consideration to this matter of which my mind is capable. I was so impressed by the moulders' strike, and with some of the cases brought before me in connection with it, that I immediately applied myself to a survey of the whole field of arguments which were adduced for and against one method and the other in the controversy over the old Act, to the experience which had been obtained since, and to the particular case which was before my notice at that time. The result of all my consideration was to come to the conclusion that, imperfect as the method adopted was, I could not find a better without laying the whole situation open to far worse anomalies than what we were then suffering from. That, quite frankly, is the conclusion at which I have arrived, and I should be dishonest with the Committee if I said that between now and the Report stage I have any hope that I could devise a method of solution differing from that in the Bill itself. Accordingly, I am afraid I cannot give the assurance which I am asked to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the effect of this Amendment in the case of a sympathetic strike? Would the members of the Union who came out in sympathy be entitled to Unemployment Benefit? [HON. MEMBERS: "NO, no"]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sympathetic strike the people who were in sympathy with the strikers would draw Unemployment Benefit and use the Trade Union funds to
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
subsidise the strike. [HON. MEMBERS: "No, no"] We have only come through a recent experience. Hon. Members will recollect that at the same time the engineers were drawing Unemployment Benefit they were subsidising the moulders' strike. That is perfectly well known. This would lead to far greater abuse, and it is because of the possibility of such cases as this that we propose what we do. I know there is a different temper coming into industry. Many of the things which may have been feared in the past will in the future not happen. But, taking conditions as we find them to-day, I really cannot say to the Committee that they would be wise in altering the system we have at present in vogue. Imperfect as it is, nevertheless, it cannot be improved upon without opening up very much greater abuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. CLYNES</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two considerations that the Minister completely overlooked. I should like to point them out. He has, I think, failed to distinguish between the conduct of an association in trade disputes and the position of the individual. We are asking that cases of individuals, as distinct from the conduct of associations, shall be covered by the provisions of this measure. My right hon. Friend has not done justice to that fundamental distinction. The whole case rests upon what are termed the practical difficulties. If he showed a disposition to try to overcome the practical difficulties in order that the man who has a right should have his claim considered, the Trade Unions concerned would be prepared to accept the lists of employment of the particular firms as showing who was and who was not insured, who was and who was not entitled to claim, and who was or who was not in the strike or dispute. I dare say the Trade Unions would be agreeable to abide by the decision of the local Unemployment Exchange in this matter; for the Trade Unions ought not to be the judges of their own claims. We are not asking that they should be. Surely it is not beyond the capacity of my right hon. Friend to discover some instrument to decide upon the merits in a difficulty such as this. There is another point about the Trade Unions proposing to use this law to start a strike on the basis of the keymen. My right. hon. Friend will know sufficient of the cause of these disputes to know that in 99 out of 100 cases the Trade Unions that have begun
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1920-1920V000P3I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
a dispute prescribe the classes of men for whom they are taking action. Therefore in the documents of the Trade Unions you have all the facts available which are necessary to be given in order to settle these matters. I very much regret that my right hon. Friend has not given that attention which these considerations deserve, but there is such a body of opinion in this Committee to the effect that the practical differences ought to be overcome, and that the innocent man ought not to be punished for the offences of some other person, that even at this stage I would appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. GRUNDY</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to put this hypothetical case to the right hon. Gentleman. Under the Insurance Act, Part 2, the miners were not insured for unemployment, but they will come under this Act. If the engine winders at a colliery declare a strike, the miners are helpless. The men belong to two separate associations. The miners would be unable to work if the engine winders struck, because the miners cannot descend if the engine winders are on strike. In a case of that kind, would the miners be entitled to Unemployment Benefit under this Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir R. HORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question would be one to be answered by the Umpire as to whether you could say that one class of work was so sectionised from the other as to form a different part of the industry, and it would be upon that consideration that he would decide whether or not the miners were entitled to Unemployment Benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. ROSE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a suggestion to make. I would not have offered it if I thought the gentlemen who advise the Minister are expert industrialists. They are excellent people at figures, very fine arithmeticians, but I do not think they are industrialists, and I suppose this Bill is framed upon the main principles of the old benefit-paying unions, the old amalgamated unions, in which I have had a very great deal of experience. May I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that the guarantee which we set up in those unions against people claiming benefits who were not entitled to them are such guarantees and securities that he and his advisers might seriously consider them? I will take the Amalgamated Society
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
of Engineers as possibly the root of all the big benefit-paying societies. If a man be thrown out of employment through a strike, through being withdrawn, or from any act of that kind in connection with a trade dispute, he gets a separate benefit, called Contingent Benefit, which is added to his Unemployment Benefit. That system has been in operation before there was any Act at all. The man who is not out on strike, but is only thrown out of work, through no fault of his own, is entitled, not to Contingent Benefit, but only to Out-of-work Benefit. Why should not that principle at least be considered by the Minister? These men who are entitled by the rules of their Union to strike benefitâ€”if their Unions have not any friendly fund, but only strike funds, the thing could be just as easily adjustedâ€”and the man who is entitled to Contingent Benefit or to the Strike Benefit of his Union are clearly not entitled to Unemployment Benefit; but the man who is not entitled to Strike Benefit clearly, in my opinion, might be made entitled to Unemployment Benefit under this Bill. It seems to me that there is security there against any sort of malpractice. It may seem an audacious thing to say, but I do believe that the administration of the best benefit-paying Trade Unions is a model that any Government Department may very well follow. They are the least possibly corrupt, they are perfectly sound financially, and they have made fools of all the actuaries who have ever lived, and who predicted their immediate extinction in the course of certain conditions which must inevitably arise. The Unions have survived and have paid 20s. in the pound, and they have some millions of pounds of bank balance now, so that their officials cannot have been so very bad as financiers. I suggest that precautions of that character might very well be considered by the right hon. Gentleman, and, in spite of the fact that he has given his ultimatum and says that he will not consider it any more, I hope he will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
