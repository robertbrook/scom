	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, the Committee has considered the draft Welfare of Pigs Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote>
It is with a sense of deja vu that I stand before the Committee to open the debate on the regulations. As the subject of pig husbandry has received so much attention in the House, I will not waste the Committee's time by rehearsing all of the events that have led to our being here today. However, the moment cannot pass without me again acknowledging my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Barton (Sir R. Body). By promoting his private Member's Bill, he ably brought the subject of pig husbandry to the forefront of the animal welfare debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Report and Third Reading of that Bill on 26 April my hon. Friend proposed the motion that the order for consideration of the Bill be discharged and the Bill be withdrawn. During the debate, I assured the House that I would introduce Government regulations under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provision) Act 1968 to achieve the same objectives as the Bill as it had been amended in Committee. That commitment has been honoured and the regulations before the Committee today exactly reflect the Bill as it stood on 26 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some hon. Members tabled amendments to the Pig Husbandry Bill, which would have created further exceptions from the ban on close confinement. Those amendments have not been properly debated and I will be happy if our discussions cover that issue. At this stage, I shall comment on them only briefly. The key industry concerns are that the inability to confine sows closely for a period after weaning will lead to a deterioration in welfare standards. The Government have not accepted those arguments. We have not yet heard a convincing welfare case for close confinement. Although I am prepared to consider new information and to keep the matter under review, the Government would need a great deal of convincing that it is right to keep a sow in a two foot-wide crate after weaning. We do not accept that alternatives to close confinement systems during that period cannot work—many producers already use them successfully. We estimate that about 45 per cent. of the 800,000 sows in the United Kingdom are kept in stall-free systems. We do not say that we know everything about the alternatives. They could be further refined, which is why the Government's research programme on pig welfare is concentrating on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Some sows may need individual attention for certain reasons or may not adapt to group-housing systems, though such sows would constitute a relatively small proportion of the herds. For that reason we have not ruled out the possibility of individual housing for animals. By abolishing the close confinement stall and tether systems we are not stopping the individual housing of sows provided that the pen is big enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, the Member for Richmond, Yorks. (Mr. Hague) said on 26 April:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The greatest problems of stock management and welfare arise in the first 35 days after weaning, if one does not have either a good stockman … or a stall system"—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 April 1991; Vol. 189, c.1389.]</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether all pig farmers would agree that the greatest problems arise during that period. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend is right to say that good stockmanship and management will allow for the successful replacement of stalls and tethers with alternative systems. Indeed, the need for the industry to have sufficient time to achieve the necessary levels of management was one of the major considerations of the Government's amendment to the original Bill to have the phase-out date implemented at the end of 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for the rest of the European Community to follow our lead as soon as possible. We will press for our standards to be adopted on a Community basis, and we know that we will have the support of the Commission. We also know that other member states share our aims and are interested in our actions. The Committee has my assurance that the Government will do all that they can to bring about a Community phase-out of present systems from the earliest possible date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide for the right way forward for our industry. Many pig producers will be pleased that the uncertainty over future production systems that has existed for the past two or three years will be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In due course, the regulations will give those in the industry the opportunity to say that United Kingdom-produced pigmeat comes from animals that are not kept continuously close confined in stalls or tethered. Compared with our European competitors, we have the great marketing advantage on animal welfare. Consumers may consider that industries in some other Community countries have the edge on us in some sectors—perhaps with French wine or German sausages—but we know, and our consumers should know, that we lead on welfare. The public must be made to know that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have protected the veal calf; now we are protecting pigs. We have acted for the welfare of the animals, but there is no reason why our industry should not make use of the marketing opportunities offered by the regulations. Some producers are sceptical whether such marketing advantages exist. However, the industry has eight years to ensure that all the pigmeat that reaches the shelves on our shops comes from farms operating the best welfare-orientated systems that are available. Some supermarkets already see the possibilities of such action. I shall be taking every opportunity to remind
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
producers, manufacturers and retailers of the welfare action that we have taken and to remind them that our competitors in other countries have not taken such action. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the Minister's example and be brief, because, as he said, the matter has been considered in detail on the Floor of the House and in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that we cannot amend the regulations, so we have either to accept them or vote against them. We shall not oppose them. Legislation will be implemented by way of regulations instead under the Pig Husbandry Bill—that was introduced by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Sir R. Body). The regulations have the same objectives as those in the hon. Gentleman's Bill—when it came to the House on Report. They are not, however, identical to the hon. Gentleman's original Bill, and the Minister would not say that they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members would have preferred the original Pig Husbandry Bill to have been enacted because it provided for a much tighter time schedule within which the changes would be made than is proposed under the regulations. My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) who dealt with the Bill in the House and in Committee made clear that the Labour party supported the original wording of the Bill. We are sorry that the time limit for implementation of the regulations is not as speedy as we would have wished. Having said that, we accept the current position. If some Conservative Members oppose the regulations and press them to a Division, we shall support the Government to enable them to be passed today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, wish to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Holland with Boston for his Bill. Members of Parliament received a considerable amount of mail on the issue and widespread interest was shown in pig husbandry when the hon. Gentleman's Bill was debated. Clearly, people are worried about animal welfare. As Opposition Members recognise, we still have a long way to go towards reducing and eliminating unnecessary cruelty to animals during farming and meat production processes. The proposals contained in the Labour party's document on such matters have been well received in many parts of the country. We shall promote them vigorously as we move towards the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Pig Husbandry Bill was being discussed in the House the National Farmers Union sent a briefing to pig producers urging them to lobby their Member of Parliament. I do not know whether the union misunderstood the Bill's proposals or whether that briefing was a deliberate misrepresentation. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As it stands, the bill prevents not only sows being housed in individual stalls or by tethers during pregnancy but also any pig being narrowly confined at any stage of its life (including farrowing)."</p></blockquote>
That is not how we see it and I hope that the Minister can make it clear that that is not a true description of the proposals. I repeat that I do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
know whether there was a misunderstanding on the part of the NFU or if there was a reason for that misleading statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter sent to Compassion in World Farming by Professor A.J.F. Webster of the university of Bristol stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This bill seeks to ensure that when pigs are kept in a stall or pen on agricultural land they 'should be free to turn round without difficulty at all times' except for special circumstances such as feeding, service and A.I., veterinary inspection and during the period of farrowing"—</p></blockquote>
to which I just referred—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and lactation … It is the opinion of the Farm Animal Welfare Council, as it was the opinion of the original Brambell Committee (1965), that to deny a pig freedom to turn round without difficulty is unacceptable. I would add that it is also illegal for any pig kept under the authority of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986)."</p></blockquote>
Compassion in World Farming strongly supports the direction in which we are moving and obviously wants to see further movement towards eliminating cruelty and other unnecessary procedures that are still followed in part in agricultural production. Increasingly the public regard those methods as unacceptable and all hon. Members must recognise that. People do not find it acceptable to produce pigs by intensive farming methods that incorporate cruelty and want their use to be greatly reduced and eliminated completely as speedily as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that Europe would move in the same direction as ourselves. I refer to a document relating to David Wilkins, the chief veterinary officer of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It refers to a letter
	<br><blockquote><p>"sent from the Commission Services on 11 February 1991 to the Ministry's chief veterinary officer in reply to his letter asking for the Commission Services opinion."</p></blockquote>That letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission, in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, will support your Government's proposals to extend the ban on sow stalls and tethers to the whole Community."</p></blockquote>
The document continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission Services will support the Government initiative to ban sow stalls and tethers."</p></blockquote>
If we had not had debates on this issue in the earlier months of the year, we could continue to discuss it at great length because it is of great importance. We regret that the transition period will be longer than we regard as necessary, but if the Committee were to reject the proposals and we did not implement the regulations, we should have to depend on another private Member's Bill. That would not achieve our objective of moving in the right direction as rapidly as possible. If the matter is pressed to a vote, we will support the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, having given an undertaking to introduce the regulations, have moved fairly speedily. The Pig Husbandry Bill failed to complete its Report stage on 26 April and, less than two months later, the Government have fulfilled their undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Thompson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Calder Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister for bringing the regulations into Committee so speedily. The pros and cons of the regulations need not be discussed in detail. As the hon. Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
said, the regulations will be accepted with a massive majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food leads Europe on animal welfare. Nowhere in Europe is animal welfare regarded one fiftieth as highly as it is in this country. Other countries may have green parties, but they have peculiar ideas about animal welfare. In Bavaria, dairy cows are confined and tethered in what we used to call mistals from the day of their birth to the day of their death. Pigs are kept in close confinement all over Europe. Veal crates continue to be used, although we banned them some time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take no lessons whatsoever, Mr. Minister, from anything people tell you about animal welfare in Europe and do not wholly believe the RSPCA when it hides behind individual European examples. Examples of good practice in Europe are often the exception. In this country, examples of bad practice are the rare exception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise for my late arrival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, when the Pig Husbandry Bill was debated in the Chamber I supported it, but I welcomed the Government's intention to introduce the regulations. I still welcome those regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lead pig research unit is in my constituency. I have received representations from the unit's scientists and from the chief veterinary officer of the Scottish Office who have expressed anxiety about whether they can ensure that the regulations are implemented in a way that fully meets pig welfare interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, the evidence suggests that freer range husbandry eliminates many of the problems that are brought about by pecking orders in confined areas, such as vulva biting and other attacks. Will the Minister ensure that research units and veterinary officers are fully involved and supported in trying to ensure that, when the regulations are implemented, a method of husbandry is created that eliminates such problems? We do not want people to say, 10 years hence, that they thought that we had introduced pig welfare measures, but that the terrible things of which the researchers warned were still happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not modifying my support for the regulations nor do I want the Government to modify their support. However, we should take account of and respect—as 1 do—the advice of highly regarded researchers, as they have long records of promoting pig welfare. They say that simply implementing the regulations is not enough and that we should ensure that the new husbandry methods are in the best interests of pig welfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Barnsley (Mr. Pike) and for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), and to my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Mr. Thompson) for contributing to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gordon made a valid point. Of course, we have much research to do on pig
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
welfare, especially on potential farrowing systems. The hon. Member cited a good reason why we were keen to have a sensible time scale for the implementation of the regulations. It was not only the producers who said that the original time scale was to tight, but eminent, independent scientists and researchers, who had pig welfare at heart. They were anxious that welfare improvements should not be rushed, as all the alternatives had not been researched. That is why we had a long debate in Committee on the time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to rewrite history and the hon. Member for Burnley must also be careful about that. It is true that Opposition Members and Conservative Members wanted the original time scale in the Bill retained. The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) asked for a tighter time scale and we had a sound, constructive debate. I told the Committee that I thought the time scale was too tight and that it should be changed. To be fair, that was accepted by most members of the Committee. The official Opposition voted for my revised time scale and only the hon. Member for Leyton abstained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I voted for the time scale in my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well I am not suggesting that I was highly persuasive in winning the argument because many hon. Members may have felt that if we did not have my time scale the Bill would fall in the House and that it was better to have mine than nothing at all. But to be fair, all members of the Committee wanted the tightest possible time scale, but accepted my argument that the eight-year phase out was reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley spoke about the letter from the NFU. I am not sure of its date, but I suspect that it was sent early in the proceedings. At the start there were many misapprehensions and false impressions going round. Farrowing is not included in the regulations unless the farrowing crate involves a tether system. Tethering in farrow systems will be phased out, but the ordinary farrowing crate, as we know it, is not included under the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people also think that single housing is banned. The important point, which was covered in the letter from Compassion in World Farming, which the hon. Member for Burnley read out, is that pigs must be free to turn round and to move about. There is nothing, therefore, to stop our farmer putting our pig in a single pen provided that the pen is big enough for the pig to move round in it. Farmers must not assume that the only alternative is group housing. There are benefits in group housing, but there are still potential problems such as the pecking order, assaults and so on. There can be individual housing but, roughly, the pen will need to be twice the size of any of the present single systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley that we are in the lead on animal welfare in Europe. There is no doubt about that. We have a culture and an attitude that is more beneficial to animal welfare than any other country in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not being sordid, unethical or nastily commercial to say that if we do have that advantage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in Europe we should turn it to our commercial benefit. Animal welfare is now a food issue and the food issues of the 1990s will be taste and quality as well as animal welfare. As a result of the regulations we will be the only country in Europe—although we shall be trying to make the others catch up—to produce all our pigmeat from more welfare-friendly systems. I see no harm in saying to supermarkets that they should take advantage of that—consumers want it—and turn it to a marketing advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute what the Minister said about our comparative position at the present time. We should exercise the advantage outlined by the Minister. However, I am sure that the Minister would agree that there is no reason why we should not strive to improve existing conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. We are not being complacent while we are in the lead. We can stand still now and let other countries catch up but there are many areas where we want to make more progress. Battery cages is a good example but we have concluded that any unilateral change by Britain would not improve the welfare of hens in Europe. We would merely destroy our systems and foreign countries would squash even more birds into their battery cages to flood us with the eggs from a system that we had abolished. That is a mad thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studied the proposals in the Labour party documents and I note the caution that it exercises in trying to take unilateral action to improve animal welfare on a little-Englander, or should I say little-Great Britain scale, which ignores the rest of Europe. We want to move forward in this country and we want others to catch up with us. We can turn our lead on animal welfare to a commercial and marketing advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo every word that the Minister said about the marketing policy. The words "cruelty-free" meat should be blazoned on the labelling. However, in the past, the Common Market has objected to what is put on labels. Will the Minister give an assurance that he will not take any nonsense from the Common Market if it tries to object to labelling that says "cruelty free"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many areas in which we try not to take any nonsense from anyone about labelling, as well as on many other issues that involve the EEC. However, on labelling we do not have an entirely free hand. We cannot unilaterally decide to have a different form of nutritional labelling, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that has been fixed by the EEC. Free-range labeling for poultry meat has also been agreed by the EEC. We now have four categories; intensive, free-range, free-range and free-range. In a speech to the Institute of Grocery Distribution on Monday, I said that in future I hoped that we could sit down together and agree a labelling system, perhaps beginning with pigmeat, because people are inventing a plethora of terms to describe free-range pigmeat, conservation-grade pigmeat and open-housing pigmeat, which could lead to dangerous confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must see if there is scope for agreeing on minimum welfare standards and on roughly what we mean by "free-range" for pigmeat, which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Gordon. We must not make an assumption that "free-range" automatically means better welfare. If we do not watch some supermarkets carefully, they may impose a standard on a farmer that means that sows are welded into the ice on a bitter January morning in their outdoor cubicles because farmers have only thought of giving them more space, shoving them outside, and have forgotten about the feeding and watering regimes for extremes of climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Council and set standards where we can have proper free-range, conservation grade, or whatever the terminology is. We will have the right to use those marketing standards, those labels and quality seals of approval until such time as the EEC invents its own which apply to Europe, but we cannot use those to discriminate against other products. I do not want to discriminate against other products, but if we heighten the status of our products, and market our welfare quality we can leave consumers to decide. I know which they will buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concluding remarks have been wide of the regulations but I believe that the Committee is in complete agreement with them and it need not divide. We should all make sure that when the regulations are law we take on board the marketing message as individual consumers, because that is the best way in which to speed the implementation of such regulations in Europe. We must use our money to buy the sort of pigmeat that we alone will produce in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
