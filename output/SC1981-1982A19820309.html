	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. It may be for the convenience of the Committee, though not to its surprise, if I give notice that the Government will move another postponement of clauses motion on Thursday in order to ensure that the Scottish clauses are ready for consideration on Thursday morning when it is our hope that my hon. and learned Friend, the Solicitor-General for Scotland, will be able to assist the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that you, Mr. Dean, and the Committee will learn with distress that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) is laid up with what I understand to be pneumonia and is likely to be unable to resume his duties here for something like three weeks. Accordingly, the Committee of Selection has withdrawn his name from from the Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith) has taken his place. I am certain that we would all wish to send my hon. and learned Friend our best wishes for his recovery and, equally, to welcome my hon. Friend who has the great advantage of experience as a magistrate to bring to bear on our considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REMAND IN CUSTODY IN ABSENCE OF ACCUSED</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 44, line 31, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>" (2) Section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980 is hereby repealed.".</p></blockquote>
This amendment would repeal section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980 which enables defendants to be remanded in their absence without their consent. First, I support clause 42 which seems to be a sensible way of reducing the unnecessary demands that are currently being made on prison officers' time by the necessity for them
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
to do escort duties, and it does away with those unnecessary demands on their time without restricting the right of any defendant to insist on a personal appearance at a remand hearing if he so chooses. I shall be supporting clause 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, however, section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act provides for defendants to be remanded in their absence without the safeguard of consent by the defendant which is rightfully contained in clause 42. The 1980 Act also contains no maximum time limit between court appearances. Under its provisions, a defendant could be remanded in custody without a personal appearance at a remand hearing for an indefinite period and against his will, nor does the Act require such a defendant to be legally represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that during the prison officers' dispute the Home Secretary asked the courts to ensure that legal representation was available for defendants. He made that plea after pressure had been put upon him during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. It appears that legal representation was offered to defendants in most cases during the course of that dispute and the operation of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to a sample survey carried out by the Home Office in one week in December, about 7 per cent, of defendants remanded in custody in their absence in that period were unrepresented. Clearly, although it is a small number, even 7 unrepresented defendants out of 100 who are remanded in custody in their absence is seven too many, and I am sure that the Minister would accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to personal appearance in court to present one's case for bail is obviously very important in terms of principle, and it is certainly crucial in practical terms. Apart from the fact that remand prisoners are often held in the most appalling conditions in the local prisons, a defendant who is remanded in custody may lose his earnings, his job, have difficulty with his accommodation all as a result of being refused bail. His family may suffer financially as well as emotionally from his imprisonment. He is placed at a severe disadvantage in preparing his case for trial in terms of tracing witnesses, collecting evidence in mitigation and pressing his solicitor to give sufficient attention to his case. For those and other reasons a personal appearance should only be waived by a defendant who, after considering all the facts and taking legal advice, consents to forego his fundamental right to a personal appearance in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light, therefore, of what I regard as the sensible provisions in clause 42, which I support, I cannot see any reason for the retention in legislation of section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act, which I regarded as offensive and indefensible at the time and which I find no more attractive at the moment. Given the principles and the practice which will be laid down in clause 42, there seems to me to be no reason at all for the retention of this section of the Act on the statute book. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will feel able to give a clear assurance that if he is not able
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
now to accept this amendment he will return to it at another stage in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his expression of support for clause 42, the detailed provisions of which are included in schedule 8. I agree with him when he places great emphasis on the importance of the right to be present in court in support of an application for bail when a prisoner is on remand. There is nothing between us there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions Act 1980, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly said, when it is in force, which it not at the moment, provides that a person remanded in custody by a magistrates' court, other than to the custody of a constabel, shall not be brought before the court at the end of the period of remand unless the court directs that he should be brought before it and may be further remanded in his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision may be brought into force by Order made under section 8 of the Act, and it was devised to meet the circumstances that arose during the prison officers' industrial action in late 1980. It is, of course, for Parliament to decide whether that Act should be renewed because it has to be renewed at periodic intervals as the Committee will be aware, and in coming to that decision when the matter next comes for renewal, Parliament will need to ask itself whether potential emergencies justify the retention of this special power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remand prisoners were not admitted to prison at that time, but were held in various places, often at considerable distances from the court handling their cases. In such circumstances, it would not have been practical to arrange for every remand prisoner to be produced in court every eight days for further remand hearings. Section 2 of the 1980 Act accordingly allowed such productions to be dispensed with although the court retained the power to order production if it wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill, as drafted, would allow section 2 to operate without amendment if circumstances were to arise in which Parliament brought it into force once more. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would have the effect of requiring the courts in such circumstances to operate within the framework of the remand provisions in the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 as eventually amended by this Bill and in particular by schedule 8. For practical purposes whether the court could dispense with the remand prisoner's production would depend upon the prior consent of the prisoner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, I am afraid—although I have listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has said—are not able to accept this amendment. Section 2 is not in force at the present time and it would be brought into force only in an emergency of a gravity similar to that caused by the prison officers' industrial action in late 1980 and early 1981. At that time, remand prisoners could not be admitted to prison and they had to be held at various distant locations in many cases. It was not then practical to produce large numbers of remand prisoners
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
in court every eight days in such circumstances, nor might it be practical if similar circumstances arose again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For just such an emergency—so long as Parliament thinks it right to retain the Act as a whole— we must retain for the time being the power in section 2 for courts
	<br><blockquote><p>" further to remand a prisoner in his absence without making the power dependent upon his consent"</p></blockquote>
as this amendment would do, provided, of course, that schedule 8 of the Bill is eventually enacted in its present form. I hope that, if not with great audibility, I have been able with a greater degree of intellectual clarity to explain the Government's attitude. I am grateful, as I said, for the hon. Gentleman's support of clause 42 as a whole, but we do not feel able, so long as the 1980 Act remains in force, to dispense with the provisions of section 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act 1980 should remain on the statute book a day longer than is necessary. My hon. Friend's arguments about the offensiveness of people being remanded usually in custody without representation, without a right to be held, without anybody to put the case in favour of bail, is something that must be abhorrent to anybody who has a proper perception of civil liberties and who is opposed to wrongful imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friend, I do not support the provisions in clause 42 and schedule 8. I shall give my reasons for that a little later, as it would probably be more appropriate to do so on the clause stand part debate. If, indeed, clause 42 is to become law as the Minister, not perhaps without good reason, forecast it would, I cannot see for the life of me why section 2 of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act should remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 42 is to enable those held on remand to be further remanded without the necessity of appearing in court, but with their consent. That could cover the emergency envisaged, which is the Minister's sole reason for retaining section 2. I do not think that it is a valid one. I am sorry that the Minister's voice is not as firm and polished as usual. His intellectual arguments, while good, were not convincing. I urge my hon. Friends to support my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly oppose clause 42 and schedule 8, of which it is part. The requirement for a prisoner waiting trial to be present in court every eight days before he is further remanded has been an important safeguard against injustice and unfair imprisonment. It has protected the prisoner held on remand in custody over the years, and it continues to protect him well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several reasons why it has proved to be an effective safeguard. The necessity for the accused to make a regular appearance in court every eight days is important for several reasons. First it enables the accused to discuss his case with his solicitor, or with his counsel. That is clearly of great significance and help to the accused, if his case is to be properly prepared, as it ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a bail application is to be successfully made, it is important that the accused should be in court to see his solicitor, to give him proper instructions, and posibly to acquaint his legal adviser, whether it be solicitor or counsel, about any fresh circumstances that may have arisen during the eight days previously. It also does something else. By his constant, regular appearances in court, it puts pressure on the prosecution to prepare the case properly and speedily and not to indulge in lethargy and undue delay. I am not saying deliberately, but it frequently does happen, to the disadvantage of the prisoner and the accused. It also puts pressure on the defence to prepare its case quickly, to put its arguments in court more quickly than it might have done. That is plainly to the advantage of the accused. Incidentally, if he is eventually acquitted, or given a non-custodial sentence, it eases the strain on the prison system, particularly in the case of prisons where remand prisoners are held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also enables the accused to see for himself what is actually happening to his case—and why should he not know what is actually happening? His future is at stake. It is his case that is to be discussed. It is a decision about whether he is to be remanded, or whether he is to be given bail. It is important that he should not be excluded from those arguments, that at least he should see for himself how far his case has progressed, and if it has not progressed, at least be able to ask his solicitor why it has not progressed. That is an added reason why he ought to be in court regularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be evident to the Committee—I am sure I am not telling hon. Members anything of which they are not aware—that the defendant remanded in custody is at an obvious disadvantage over the preparation of his case. He cannot contact witnesses himself. It is difficult—in some cases impossible—for him to telephone his solicitor, and so on. It is, then, vital to him that he should have that opportunity of seeing his solicitor every eight days, to consult with him and to help prepare his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, solicitors rarely go to prisons to see their clients. I am not saying that they do not go, but they do not go frequently. That is the view of the Law Society, which is strongly opposed to the provisions of clause 42 and schedule 8, and wants to see the present eight-day remand system retained, as does the Legal Action Group. The Howard
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
League also has great doubts as to the provisions which the Government propose to enact by clause 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This important safeguard which I have described, that has served our justice system very well over the years, and has prevented countless people from being held in custody when it is unnecessary, is now under threat. It is under threat not for any logical reason—not because the system is not working—but because the production of prisoners at eight-day intervals, as the Home Secretary says, places an unnecessary burden on the police and the prison service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that that is so, and I understand that about 7 per cent, of the prison manpower is used in escorting prisoners to and from court for remand applications. That is a regrettable fact, but it is not in my submission a reason for doing away with the eight-day system. Half of those who are remanded in custody are eventually found not guilty or are given non-custodial sentences. This means that half of those people who are remanded in custody should not be so remanded, since they are eventually found not guilty or are given non-custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Government have gone some way to limit their original proposals and that the prisoner is now not to be remanded in his absence unless he consents to that remand. That is all very well, but unfortunately there will be many prisoners who will be disadvantaged by the results of that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has found that in many cases a major factor in the decision as to whether or not the prisoner refuses or consents to the relaxation of the eight-day remand will be the attitude of the court. There will be courts which will expect defendants to agree to remands in their absence, while others may remain genuinely neutral or may even discourage defendants from agreeing to have their case remanded in their absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society also found that the attitude of individual solicitors is likely to vary considerably. Some solicitors, perhaps not for the best reasons, will be happy that remands should take place in their clients' absence. Others, for perhaps better reasons, will take the view that their clients should always be present on a remand hearing. There will be a difference in attitude between those accused who are subject to the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be defendants who are knowledgeable and experienced, those who are more literate and articulate, perhaps defendants who are more used to court procedure—because they may have experienced it before—who will insist on their right to be brought to court for every remand hearing. There will be others who are less articulate, less literate, less used to court procedure, less used to dealing with solicitors, less aware of the consequences of what might happen if they are not represented, who will more passively accept the advice offered by their solicitors or by the court and who will be more easily dissuaded, particularly if the court takes a strong view about the need for the accused not to be in court. Such accused might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
well, therefore, forego their right to be represented, be remanded in their absence and might well suffer as a result. The tragic effect is likely to be that the defendants who are in most need of the protection of a regular appearance before the courts will decline to consent and, on the other side of the fence, those who do not require a regular appearance, because there is very little likelihood of them actually being granted bail, will give their consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any justification at all, based on what I think are called resource requirements—a terrible phrase to justify such an important change in legal procedures as this—for savaging a system that has served the accused and the courts and enhanced our legal procedures over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) is not in favour of the arguments I have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps he is by now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I hope I have persuaded him. Even my hon. Friend can sometimes be wrong, and on this occasion he is tragically wrong. However, I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, and perhaps I can reserve those few arguments that I have left until after I have heard his reply in order to make a last-ditch attempt to persuade the Committee to overthrow clause 42 and schedule 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most people accept that in the majority of cases the requirement that a prisoner be brought forward every eight days is unnecessarily burdensome and expensive. For that reason, I shall be disposed to support the clause, but there are just two slight doubts in my mind which I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend would allay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that the kind of prisoner who is, perhaps, most ignorant and most inadequate might be the kind of prisoner who would be least likely to insist on his rights should he feel that it was necessary to be brought forward every eight days. The second doubt is that the requirement that a prisoner be brought forward every eight days, whatever nuisance value it may have, certainly does serve constantly to remind us of any delay there may be in the system of administration of justice. To allow a prisoner to sink without trace, so to speak, for 36 days may allow us to forget just how long it takes to bring cases to trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two slight doubts that I have in my mind, and I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend could address his remarks to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When this proposal was first put forward in the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act, I spoke against it. I certainly was opposed to it. In the interim, I have listened to the evidence that was given to the Select Committee about it, and we have had the oppor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
tunity of judging on the experiment that took place during the period that the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act was in force. In those circumstances, I have now become at least agnostic, but certainly not unfavourable to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, therefore, a little sorry that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) did not use all his arguments because he might just have persuaded me. I do not know the strength of the arguments he has not used because he got down to the last vestige of the desperate reactionary Tory when he said that we had had it for a long time. That is the kind of argument that the Minister uses occasionally. Merely because we have had a rule in the law for a long time, it is not vital to go on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never suggested that just because we have had it for a long time we should not change it. I said that it has served the purposes of justice very well indeed and, unless there are exceptionally strong reasons for changing it, other than administrative convenience, it should not be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know the way in which we clothe our reactionary instincts. That simply means that we have had it for a long time. It does not prove anything. The real issue is whether the change would be likely to work to the disadvantage of the accused. If it were, I should be opposed to it. I am perfectly willing to be persuaded. On the other hand, there is the considerable factor, which we cannot simply gainsay, that the burden upon the prison staff of bringing prisoners to the magistrates' court every seven days in order to appear on remand is considerable and causes the prison service regime to fail to act in the positive ways that I want to encourage. If we had as many men as we wanted, and if we did not remand so many prisoners in custody, it might be possible to continue with the eight-day rule, but, in the circumstances, there is a case for doing away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fortified in that by looking at the schedule. As I recollect, under the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act the person was not brought before the court and no one appeared before the court. It is difficult to follow the schedule, but, as I understand it, it is proposed that there will be a remand hearing every eight days but that the accused need not be present if he does not want to be. He would be there in any event if he was not represented. I cannot see how injustice is likely to accrue to the accused. If he wants to be present, if only for the outing, he can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hen. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) may well be right that many prisoners will take perverse pleasure in ensuring that they are there every eight days and that the drain on the prison staff will continue. But, that apart, I cannot honestly see any real danger to the accused. If that danger manifests itself in the years ahead, no doubt we can change the provision, but it is perfectly possible at the moment to indicate that we should accept.

I am sorry that my suggestion causes ribaldry on the part of my hon. and learned Friend. It is possible to change legislation. We do it occasionally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had Conservative Men> bers used an argument like that to justify changing something which my hon. Friend did not want changed, and said, " Well, we can always change it back later ", my hon. Friend would have been the first to destroy that argument. He would have destroyed it with ribaldry, wit and rapier-like argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that tribute to my destructive qualities. I have no doubt that that is true. Circumstances change cases, and on this occasion I do not think that we can vote against the proposal, given all the safeguards that are built in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too support this clause, the general effect of which is similar to a recommendation made by the all-party Penal Affairs Group in its report " Too Many Prisoners", published in June 1980. That report recommended that when a defendant is legally represented and consents to this course, a court should be able to remand him in custody for up to 21 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In coming to that recommendation we, like the Home Office Select Committee which came to a similar conclusion and issued a similar recommendation, were forcibly impressed by the time which prison officers working in local prisons and remand centres have to spend escorting prisoners to and from the courts every week to be remanded in custody yet again. We were concerned that at the same time that a considerable number of prison officers were involved in this laborious and time-consuming task, prison workshops were not opened, prison activities were curtailed, education classes were closed, and vocational training classes were not able to be provided—all because there were insufficient prison officers within the prison system to be able adequately to supervise these activities. Therefore, some of the most worthwhile, positive and constructive features of the prison system were not effective because of the absence of prison officers on escort duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that clause 42 is not designed specifically to improve prison conditions, nor will it be the most important factor, but it will have some effect. One would hope that as a result of the implementation of clause 42 more prison officers will be able to do the job for which they are appointed, paid and trained—to supervise prisoners within the prison system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) I could not conceivably support this clause for one single moment if it did not contain the safeguards of legal representation for the defendant and the consent of the defendant. Both those safeguards are clearly in the clause, and I cannot see any conceivable reason to argue against a proposition of this nature which is based upon the consent of the defendant to its implementation and the fact that he will have to be legally represented if he is remanded in his absence. I can see no reason at
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
all to compel a prisoner to appear in court every eight days. I cannot see any reason to compel him to undergo what can sometimes be a long and tiring journey—
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, it is. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington may grimace, but he had been in a crowded prison or police van and sometimes been taken two or three hundred miles to be remanded in court yet again, kept below stairs in a crowded court cell, waiting to be taken upstairs for a procedure that is a formality and then taken all the way back two or three hundred miles perhaps from the court, I am sure he too would sometimes regard it as a burden and tiresome. As he has not had that journey or experience it is easy for him to grimace at the prospect of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is—as my hon. and learned Friend should realise—that if the prisoner concerned wants to do the journey, go in the prison or police van and wait in the cells below the court, he can do so. He has the option to insist on that remand. I can see no reason at all why it should be proper or appropriate to compel prisoners to undergo the present remand system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two all-party reports, one of which I chaired, have in the last couple of years recommended proposals very similar to those contained in clause 42. I cannot, therefore, having endorsed both those reports, have any option but to support the Government on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to make one point in conclusion. The Minister will recall that the report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs on the provisions of this clause also contains the recommendation that the implementation of the clause should be carefully monitored for the first year or two of its operation. That seems to be a sensible recommendation, particularly in the light of the comments made by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) and my hon. Friend the Member for York. Given that some fears have been expressed about the way in which some of the more inadequate and inarticulate defendants may react or feel pressured not to insist upon their legal rights to have the present system of remand appearances, perhaps we could overcome that by ensuring that the new procedures, when implemented, are carefully, properly monitored and that the Minister will in due course make a report on their operation to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come to this discussion with all the objectivity of a non-lawyer. I have listened to the support of the clause from my hon. Friends, but I have also read very carefully the Law Society's opposition to the clause. I do not think one can lightly dismiss the presumably collective view of a body of solicitors on this matter. Some of the arguments put in favour of the clause are the Home Secretary's arguments used on Second Reading, that the present procedure is costly. My hon. Friends have mentioned manpower, time and the fact that it is terribly tiring for the poor defendant to be taken to court in a crowded van and brought back again. These may be arguments with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
which one can have some sympathy, but the main argument of the Law Society is that this clause represents a potential injustice. That seems to me to be a far stronger argument against it than ones of time lost, manpower, inconvenience and a burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect, according to the Law Society—I am putting these arguments in the hope that the Minister will answer them one by one—is that there will be longer overall periods in custody for untried defendants as there will be less sense of urgency to proceed for the prosecution. That could be the general effect—less pressure on the prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the court should retain its opportunity to examine a case every eight days, because it is the only way in which the defendant can definitely, whether he likes it or not, be seen and heard in person at regular intervals, for example, when bail is assessed and sureties examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see that this is just a formality which would be gone through in a routine way. This surely is a very important part of our procedures in court. Lord Elwyn-Jones has said that the regular appearance for an unconvicted accused is an ancient and, indeed, necessary safeguard against abuse and injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend was criticised for using the word " ancient" or " longstanding " and the fact that it had been going on for a long time. That is not in itself a justification for it, but it is certainly not a criticism of it. However, it is an ancient and necessary safeguard against abuse and injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, courts should not delegate their responsibilities to a defence solicitor. In what is proposed, a great deal of responsibility will rest on the solicitor's decision and clients—defendants—take a great deal of notice of what their solicitors tell or advise them to do. They rely very heavily on their solicitors' advice. An enormous amount of power is being put into solicitors' hands. The defence solicitor's agreement is a poor safeguard for the defendant's rights, and there are few defendants who would want, or feel able, to resist their solicitor's advice in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that one of the difficulties a solicitor would be faced with, is that under the circular 81/3 issued by the Lord Chancellor in March 1981, it consitutes a positive discouragement to solicitors to appear at remand hearings, on the grounds that it is not a necessary appearance. The solicitor might not be paid for that appearance out of legal aid funds and, therefore, there is an inducement for him to persuade the defendant not to make an appearance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the solicitors themselves have admitted that. First of all, the Law Society has admitted that the defendant is likely to rely heavily on the solicitor's advice. Secondly, the solicitors say that it is difficult to advise their clients that they will have no prospect of applying for bail, in the next few weeks, to take an example. The Law Society even admits that some solicitors may allow their advice to be tinged with considera-
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
tions of their own convenience. That is clearly possible—solicitors are not perfect, and provision is being put into the Bill whereby they can exert an enormous influence over what happens to their clients. The eight-day custody remand appearance is a public act of review. It reviews the physical condition of the defendant, which is important, and the progress of his case. This is a valuable safeguard of his rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were remanded in custody, even if it were a very long journey in a crowded van, I should certainly want to go to court every eight days, and I should resent a solicitor trying to talk me out of it, or saying that it did not matter, that it was merely a formality, that nothing much would happen and that there was no point. The right to make a bail application, or to be advised about making a bail application, should rest in the law. It should be in the statute, and it should not rest merely on the solicitor's estimates of his client's interests, even if these are given in completely good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Law Society itself is opposed to this provision in the Bill, is surely something that the Minister should be able to answer fully. He should justify why he is going against the Law Society's view. I do not feel that the Home Secretary's argument about cost is at all an adequate argument to go against that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not be a lawyer, and may not know what goes on in court on remand, but she was the Minister responsible for the prisons. Surely she knew about the strain placed on the prison service by appearance in court on remand. Has not she a duty, just as we have, to balance the interests of the accused against the difficulties caused to the prison service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that my hon. Friend either has not listened or has not followed my argument. I know that the prisons are very full. I know that we are short of prison officers and police. I know that it is a long, uncomfortable, crowded journey to court. I believe, however, that this obligation for the defendant to appear in court every eight days with his solicitor is far greater than all those problems about cost and manpower. That is the point that I am making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have listened to the debate, I have become more and more uneasy about the Government's proposals. The sort of arguments that are being used are, as has just been admitted, to do with striking a balance between the interests of the accused and the ability of the prison service to function properly. It is proper to have those considerations in mind, but when one talks about striking a balance, put another way it bluntly means that one is prepared to erode the rights of prisoners in the interests of other considerations. When I hear that, I become rather unhappy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people go to a prison, sometimes not very intelligent people, it is a safeguard to them to be brought into the light of day, from a closed prison to an open court, every eight days. If we say that they may not come out until every fourth such occasion—I make that about 32 days, but perhaps I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
got it wrong—we are really saying that those people are away from public sight for a month and are dependent upon either their own willpower and resilience or upon the alertness and integrity of their solicitor. Normally, that might be enough, but I think that if we alter the law we ought at least to accept that what we are doing is on the ground of administrative convenience. We may be driven to altering it because of that administrative convenience, but at least we must agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) that we are taking a backward step in relation to the rights of prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I hear some argument that maybe we are doing it partly to save prisoners the inconvenience of a journey, I do not know how many prisoners there are who would not prefer a journey and looking at the fresh surroundings even of a court to staying 22 hours a day, three to a cell in a prison. I have heard arguments before, but that sort of argument would be very welcome in certain States whose loyalty to the rule of law is suspect—" Let's keep the person in prison because, after all, we're thinking of the poor chap's interests; he would not like a long car journey or a long train journey, so we'll keep him locked up for a long period ". It is not an argument which appeals to me, and I cannot imagine that it would appeal to many of those who are incarcerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go some way with the argument that eight days in the light of the administrative problems is perhaps too short a period, but what we have here, as I understand it—and I am open to correction if I am wrong—is not a jump from eight to 15 or 16 days, but a jump from eight to about 32 days. Certainly, what we have heard so far from Labour Members who support the Government is an attack which has a good deal of justification in the light of the administrative difficulties on eight days. We have heard very little about a defence for 32 days, and the question is should there not be some middling position? At what point does one decide that every fourth remand is the right time for an appeal? One could argue for every third, sixth or eighth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is room here for a compromise and for a reduction in the present proposals of the Government to a shorter period of time. Whenever people who have not been convicted are kept in prison for a long time, and are kept away from public gaze, we are making society a little less safe for the rule of law. That is how it seems to me, whatever other safeguards we may have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the world we live in, with the various trends that there are, it is invaluable that we insist that people should be brought out of custody into the open where they can be seen and where they can hear their cases being considered, because they know that silence has not fallen on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying is quite correct. What worries me is whether the accused remanded in custody and faced with a dominating court or solicitor really understands that he will remain in custody without appearing in court, and without discussing
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
his case, for something like 32 days. Will he really understand that? It seems to me that there is an obligation on the court to spell that out in the legislation, and it is certainly not in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says. I also give way to the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the implication of the 28-day remand is that that is the maximum, and that a minimum can be set if the court so wishes. It depends entirely upon what the prosecution says about the possibility of putting on the case within that period. Surely the hon. and learned Gentleman recognises that since the Nottingham case it is now impossible for an applicant to get the rules of his bail changed unless there is a significant change of circumstances. It is unlike the old days where, when he came up every eight days, he could renew his demand for bail. He now has no possibility of renewing his demand for bail unless there is a change of circumstances. If there is a change of circumstances, he can inform his solicitor and his solicitor can bring him before the court in order to re-apply for bail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> Lyons: I have listened to what the hon. Gentleman said. I think he will agree that solicitors do not go very often to a prison to see their clients, because of all their commitments. They may have to go a long way, and sometimes after commital for trial and before the trial takes place—where there is a long delay because of congestion in the courts—solicitors have been known to go and visit their clients perhaps only once every two or three months. In order to obtain all the information which would enable the solicitor to give advice or to change his mind and make a fresh application, he has to be in touch with his client. The hon. Gentleman seems to postulate that the client will simply write a letter, the solicitor will read it and immediately take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Solicitors are very busy nowadays, and I am not certain that they would always take action. They might leave it for a week or even longer, and a week of anyone's liberty is a long time. A day of anyone's liberty is a long time. The worst thing about a prison sentence is the loss of liberty. That is worse than any conditions that the person endures in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that under the pressures of administrative convenience—which are very real owing to the shortage of staff and the increase in prison population— we are taking a measure which is backward in terms of the consideration of human rights. If we do this, we do it, but we should be rather ashamed and shamefaced about doing so. I believe that if we cannot get sufficient resources to enable the eight days to continue, we should try to have a period less that every fourth remand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that that right will always be exercised. The solicitor will think that there are no new facts, whereas the prisoner may have had information at the prison from his girl friend, his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
wife or his mother, which if it were in the hands of a solicitor or before a court might make a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows that whatever the laws says, much depends upon the personality of the magistrates. There have been cases where people have applied for bail for several weeks running, and suddenly out of the blue one Bench takes a different view and grants bail. Altogether, I am unhappy about keeping people away, despite the safeguards in the Bill, for as long as this. If the official Opposition divide, I would support them on this because I am unhappy—unless I hear something to the contrary which convinces me otherwise—about altering the provision from every eight days to every fourth eight-day period, which I think is too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:It is absolutely right that a proposal to diminish any right enjoyed by our fellow citizens in connection with their personal liberty should be very carefully examined, and it has been examined in the debate. That is especially so where that right has been enjoyed for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to these questions lies in the speech of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), who said that the real question was whether it would work to the disadvantage of the accused. I accept that that is the key. I do not think that it will. On the contrary, it may well work to his advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by outlining, in a rather shorthand way, what the clause provides through schedule 8. The aim of the schedule is to amend the operation of those portions of the Magistrates' Courts Act which at present require that every accused shall be brought back to court, when he is on remand, every eight days. It does so first by laying down a procedure and then by laying certain substantive requirements upon the courts. The procedural requirements, in outline, are these. They provide that, whenever a court adjourns a case during the trial of a summary offence or an either-way offence which is being tried summarily, or to determine the appropriate mode of trial for an either-way offence, or when the magistrates' court is proceeding as examining justices it shall carry out this procedure. I shall tidy it up in the 
	<i>Official Report,</i> if I am allowed to. [HON. MEMBERS: " Oh ".] I may not be allowed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where an adjournment is made in those circumstances, this procedure shall be followed. First, it must consider whether three conditions are met. These are that the person to be remanded must be present in the court, that he must be aged 17 or over, and that he must be legally represented. Those are three important safeguards. If all three conditions are satisfied, the court must explain in ordinary language to the person before it the effect of the new provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These give a magistrates' court the power to remand a person in custody in his absence, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled. The court must then inform the person, again in ordinary language, that even if he consents to be, and subsequently is,
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
remanded in his absence, he will nevertheless be brought before the court for at least every fourth remand hearing and for any hearing where it appears that he does not have a solicitor acting for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for York rightly said, remand hearings will continue every eight days, quite irrespective of any change made by the clause. The question of whether bail should be allowed has to be considered at each of those hearings. That is the procedure which has to be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next stage is that the court is required, after making the required explanations, to ask the person before it whether he consents to the hearing and determination of applications for remands in his absence. Now we come to the substantive requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court is required—where it proposes further to remand a person who has previously been remanded in custody without that person being brought before a court—to be satisfied that certain conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are, first, that the person has given his consent to the remand hearing taking place in his absence. This consent may have been given in court. It is also possible, however, that a person who had first declined to give his consent at his last remand appearance, might subsequently change his mind while in prison. It is envisaged that in such circumstances, the person would write direct to the court indicating that he has consented to the next hearing taking place in his absence, or he might request his legal representative to inform the court, either before or at the hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second condition is that the person has not been remanded in his absence on more than two occasions immediately preceding the hearing in question, because the maximum is 28 days. The effect of this condition is to ensure that a person who is being consistently remanded in custody over a period of time is produced in court at least every fourth hearing; that at the time of giving his consent the person was aged 17 or over; and, lastly, the court must be satisfied that since agreeing to the remand hearings taking place in his absence that person has not withdrawn his consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are substantial safeguards for the interests of the liberty of the accused person. I believe that not only do they represent a signficant advance upon any safeguards in the 1980 Act, but they are sufficient to ensure that the interests of the accused will not be disadvantaged. I think that that is the key question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the effect that this clause will have upon conditions in the prison and the ability of prison officers and the prison service to do their job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This would seem to be the most appropriate point to ask the Minister whether or not he will agree to the request made to the recommendations from the Home Affairs Select Committee that the effects of this clause will be monitored?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall do so. It is right that it should be monitored. It is not expected to have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
adverse consequences, but care must be taken that periods of time spent on remand in custody awaiting trial in a magistrates' court or commital for trial at the Crown court do not lengthen and that bail continues to be given in cases where it is appropriate. The Government will examine carefully how much monitoring might be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was last in Brixton prison to examine conditions there—though I do not personally bear the responsibility of administering the prison service, which is done by my noble Friend the Under-Secretary—I learnt that a considerable stress factor was involved for prisoners having to be taken every eight days to court whether they wanted to go or not. I had not realised that every item of property taken from them and booked in when they are first received into prison, has to be booked out every eight days. This is a laborious and extremely tiresome and trying operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One sees, of course, why it has to be done because it may be that bail will be allowed and they will not come back. Every eight days this laborious booking in and out of every item of property taken from them when they were first accepted into prison has to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, as the hon. Members for Ormskirk and York have said, the demands upon the prison service of providing escorts, sometimes for qourneys of 100 miles or more, every week are enormous, and that takes its toll upon what has been described as the positive part of the prison service's job within the prisons. That itself has a harmful effect on the interests of those still innocent in the eye of the law who are detained in custody on remand in prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the criticisms of the provisions of clause 42 and in particular some of the fears that have been expressed relating to possible adverse consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that it will make it much more difficult for an accused person to see his legal adviser. It is not the purpose of remand hearings and bail applications to facilitate consultation between an accused and his legal adviser. This is only an incidental consequence, hardly a purpose of remand hearings. The purpose of a remand hearing is that the court should consider once again whether it is right that the accused should remain in custody awaiting his trial or whether he should get bail. Provision is available for a remand prisoner to receive visits from his solicitor at the prison where he is detained, and correspondence between the defendant and his legal representative about his case is not restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the frequency with which solicitors meet remand prisoners will fall, but the conduct of a case, including the question of visits between a defendant and his legal adviser, is essentially a matter to be arranged within the framework of solicitor and client relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that the accused person has only to withdraw his consent, if he has given it in the first
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
place, to ensure that he will appear before the court and will continue to appear before the court every eight days. It is also said that the court may bring pressure to bear upon a defendant to agree to remand. Here I point to the careful and explicit procedure which the court will be obliged to follow. It will have to explain in ordinary language the rights of the accused person. A court will have relatively little to gain from the new provisions. It will have very little to gain from, as it were, twisting the accused's arm—which is what is suggested—to give his consent, because cases will still come before them at regular weekly intervals. There is no reason to think that courts will try to persuade defendants to agree to remands in their absence. For them to do so would be inconsistent with the duty being placed upon them to explain to the defendant that his consent is required before the new arrangement can operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that the heat will be taken off the prosecution to get on with the case and that delays will result. It has been argued that periodic appearances by the defendant serve a useful purpose in reminding the court of the need to ensure that a case is dealt with quickly, but the schedule meets this possible risk by including the provision that where he has given his consent to remands in his absence he will nevertheless be produced in court at every fourth remand hearing whatever he may wish. One way or the other, he has to be brought at every fourth remand hearing. I do not think that fear has substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is then said that this is delegating much too much of the courts' responsibilities to defence lawyers. It is said that it is all very well having these safeguards, but the reality is that the solicitor will find it convenient to pressure his client. I question the realism of that fear, if it is envisaged that somebody will put up week after week with conditions of custody which he resents and objects to because his solicitor has told him "Never mind what the court has said about giving your consent, you give your consent". I do not think that is realistic. It is important that a court should have to explain in ordinary language that he does not have to. He will be kept away from the court for a maximum of three weeks only if he gives his consent and if the court has to give that explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we should forgo the great advantages, not only to the prison service but also to those who are in prison, that would derive from the clause, by reason only of the fear that a solicitor may say, " Don't worry about what the court has said—take my advice and give your consent." At the end of the day one has to look with a realistic eye at these matters, and to weigh advantages against possible disadvantages.

The points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) were answered very succinctly by the hon. Member for York. I catch his eye, and know that he agrees. The points that I have made have probably fully answered those criticisms made by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). I do not regret any minute of the time taken over this provision, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
as I said at the beginning, it is very important that we look jealously at any proposals that might diminish the personal liberty of any of our fellow-citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am absolutely satisfied that the balance of advantage here will lie with the individual accused. When one adds to that the substantial advantages that were identified by the all-party Penal Affairs Committee and the Home Affairs Select Committee, as lying behind an amendment of this sort to our practices, it is right that we should change even a longstanding practice of this kind. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that, speaking for myself and the official Opposition, I do not agree that it should remain part of the Bill. When I hear the Minister of State, for whom I have great respect, agreeing and calling in aid my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon), I begin to worry, and think that he is in desperate difficulties. Only dire emergency, the lack of ability to master more cogent reasons, would make him retreat to the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for York, so I am naturally worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons), I have attended many trials in countries where the regime is oppressive. We have attended them because it has been considered that the principles of British justice, and particularly of court procedure, are examples to the rest of the world. When we have argued in these countries against the principle of holding people in custody for long periods without their being produced in court, we have always been able to say, " In our country that could not happen. In our country no unconvicted prisoner can be held in custody for longer than eight days without making a court appearance and without making a further application for bail." That has always been very convincing when we are arguing against oppressive regimes that do not put great weight upon judicial principles, legal principles, and upon the right of the individual. Now we are doing away with that. One of the strangest arguments that I have heard in justification—almost an argument that in normal circumstances one would regard as flippant—was that put forward by the Minister, that it really is a great chore to have to take all their belongings, check them in, and give them back again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. and learned Gentleman not go and look?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that really a subsidiary or strong reason for taking away this right of the accused prisoner to appear in court every eight days? I make a suggestion to the Minister. Why does he not change the rule? It seems to be a rule which is not incapable of being changed. It would be more sensible to change that bureaucratic rule than to interfere with the right of the individual in the way he is advocating in the clause. When I hear the arguments from my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk)—of all people—
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
that it is inconvenient for accused prisoners who have not been convicted, people who are innocent until they are convicted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say it was inconvenient. I said that certain prisoners may find it inconvenient and, no doubt, some of them will. If they do not find it inconvenient and if they do want to appear in court, no one is taking that right away from them. What my hon. Friends both seem to miss, or insist upon confusing, is the fact that the clause cannot, in effect, be implemented properly without the consent of the defendant unless he is legally represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that, and if my hon. Friend had not interrupted me as early as he did he might have heard me deal with that. However, what he is suggesting is not like the reason given by the Minister for doing away with this right of which we have all been very proud over the years. It is that some prisoners may not wish to make a long and uncomfortable journey. Frankly, I thought that the arguments made by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) on that point were devastating. Most prisoners would prefer a journey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would prefer anything rather than remain in the dull confines of the prison. My hon. Friend must not get so annoyed because occasionally I disagree with him. Even he can be wrong on occasions—as all of us can—and I happen to think he is wrong on this occasion as, indeed, on other occasions. However, I shall not burden the Committee with that because it might take too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, of course, the accused can always withdraw his consent. How is the court to know, to be convinced and to be really satisfied? How is the fact that the accused has withdrawn his consent to be transmitted to the court? It seems to me that all sorts of administrative muddles and injustices are likely to occur as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the real issue here that whereas the hardened, tough criminal if he wants to go every eight days will insist on going, and will sack his solicitor or make life difficult for his solicitor if he does not do exactly what he wants quickly, the people who will be affected by these new arrangements are the people who are in custody for the first time, sometimes the mentally low grade and others who have never been in trouble before? They will be timid and will not want to annoy the prison officers by putting them to the trouble of taking them to court and having their belongings booked in and booked out. Those are the people who will be affected by the clause. Is that not the real issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The solicitors themselves have made the point strongly that the defendants will in many cases rely heavily upon their advice because as they are ignorant, stupid or so on, they do not know what their rights are and do not know how to assert them.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman was right in his first intervention. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) was right in her intervention and the hon. and learned Gentleman was even more right in his second intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made the point in opening that the hardened criminal can look after his rights. He knows what his rights are. He will attend court if he wishes to do so. He will make certain that his solicitor attends court if he wants him to do so. The inarticulate prisoner, the person who is not used to court procedure who may be remanded in custody for the first time, will suffer as a result of this proposal. That is the argument of the Law Society, and it is very convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at my hon. Friends. Time after time in Committee they have rightly used the argument that nobody should remain in custody if it is possible for him to be at liberty. Because of the clause more people will be remanded in custody. There is no question about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because fewer people will appear for bail applications. I am surprised that my hon. Friends have not deployed that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an accused is granted bail after a gap of four weeks, one could not be certain that he would not have been granted bail two weeks earlier had he been brought before the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is right. Hon. Members talk as if being remanded in custody for something like 28 days, without getting out of that dreadful place, is something that we need not worry about. It is a dreadful proposition and the proposal is a retrograde step. If the Government felt it necessary to change the legislation because of administrative difficulties and the strain on the prison services of escorting people to and from the courts in pursuant of remand or bail applications, they should have done so in a more open and honest way. If appearing every eight days imposes a strain, why do they not change that to appearing every 15 days? That is the suggestion of the Law Society. That could be done openly instead of using this backhanded method. The Government will deeply regret this move if the proposal is carried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman comment on the fact that neither the Minister nor his allies have yet given any defence for choosing the maximum period when a person may be brought to court as every fourth remand day—in other words, every 28 or 32 days? They have said why they are against eight days, but there has been no defence against other suggested periods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have given no justification for the proposal. I suppose it could be administrative convenience, or perhaps they may have to fall back on the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for York. They have not produced any logical justification of this very major change in our court procedure. It should not be dismissed as some minor alteration of an unimportant legal principle. It is a major change in our cherished principles. If I am a conservative on that matter, I do not mind saying so. I am quite prepared to be regarded as a reactionary in defence of liberty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman does himself a great disservice in calling himself a reactionary or a conservative. Some of the arguments used on both sides of the Committee this morning will be seized on with alacrity, if they hear of them, by both the Soviet and South African Governments—for example, that we must not bring people to the courts too often, that we are thinking only of convenience, that we have to book them in and out and give them their clothes back. I hope that those arguments will not be heard by anyone outside this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. I say it sarcastically. Regimes over and over again have used administrative convenience to justify tyranny. I am not suggesting that the Government are, but it is a major change for the worse. The Government will regret it. Both my hon. Friends are quite wrong to support clause 42 and I urge the Committee, even at this late hour, to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not intervene in this discussion again if it were not for my hon. and learned Friend's concluding words. Having reviewed carefully the balance of disadvantage to the prisoner —which I accept that we should not want in normal circumstances—and the balance of disadvantage not only to the prison service but to the prisoner when he is in the prison because the regime is worse because of the strain on prison officers, I reached the conclusion that it was better to support the clause. I do so not because I support reactionary regimes in South Africa or the Soviet Union, nor because I am an enemy of civil liberty. I resent the triviali-sation of my argument. It is not the case that either my hon. Friend, myself or the Select Committee— of which I think my hon. and learned Friend was a member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene?—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[HON. MEMBERS: "Wait till he has finished."] No. I have been interrupted, and I am quite prepared to interrupt someone else. I have the same civil rights as my hon. Friends, and I intend to exercise them as they consistently exercise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which produced that report. My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) is astonishingly sensitive. Does he honestly think that I would suggest that anyone in the Committee supports tyrannies in the Soviet Union or South Africa? Certainly, I would not suggest that of my hon. Friend. He knows that. It is he who is trivialising.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
What I said, and what I stand by, is that such oppressive regimes frequently use the argument of administrative convenience to justify something that the West, which is used to liberal Western democracy, regards as tyranny. He knows that that is what I said and he knows that I am not suggesting that he, of all people, with his record, supports tyrannies. For him to put forward such an argument is really to trivialise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that such suggestions trivialise the argument. We must decide whether the maximum period for remand should be eight or 28 days. It does not mean that a person who is remanded in custody will necessarily be remanded in custody for at least 28 days. It means that the maximum period for which he can be remanded without making an appsrance is 28 days. But, in fact, the case will be dealt with every eight days in his absence. If his solicitor attends—as he is entitled to do—he will be there to put his case, if there is a case to be put. It cannot mean—as the hon. Gentleman argued—that more people will be remanded in custody. Still less does it mean that they will be remanded in custody for any longer that they are at present. It means that where the gap between a person's first appearance in court and his trial extends beyond 28 days, with his consent and the consent of his solicitor he will appear only every 28 days until his trial. In circumstances where his trial will take place in less than 28 days, that will not obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the prisoner appeared every day of the week, he would not spend any less time in custody because, following the decision of the Nottingham justices two years ago>—which is now followed by every magistrates' court—once he has applied for bail and it has been turned down he is not allowed to apply again unless there has been a change of circumstances. Few changes of circumstances are accepted by the court. After the first time that he appears in court and is refused bail, he goes down into the cells and is not likely to get out again until his trial. We are not making any distinction between the present and future positions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a question to my hon. Friend? He referred to the decision of the Nottingham justices. Does he think that the right or one that should be changed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do not think it the right decision, but it is the present position. My hon. and learned Friend is postulating a change which is adverse to the interest of the accused. It does nothing at all to change the interests of the accused because of the present habits of the magistrates in relation to application for bail. We should not let it be said that this change will have an adverse effect on the accused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend is so certain that this will not adversely affect the interests of the accused and will not lead to longer overall periods in custody, why is it necessary for the Home Office to monitor the new position? The fact that the Minister has said that it will be monitored, at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
suggestion of my hon. Friend, suggest that the Minister is not certain of the effects of the proposal on the defendant. It is yet another gamble or experiment, like the short sharp shock where we have to wait for two or three years before we have evidence about what exactly is happening. The whole case is weakened by having to monitor the results, whereas the hon. Gentleman would appear to be absolutely certain that there will be no adverse effects whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a brilliant argument from my hon. Friend, and one that I entirely accept. Therefore, let us abandon the monitoring because we have had a trial. We tried it for three months when the temporary provisions Bill was in force. If my hon. Friend can point to any letter from anybody that indicates that any prisoner was adversely affected by that trial, I will eat my words. I do not think she can do so because nobody has yet produced one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders did not produce it in their representations to us. The Law Society did not produce it in their representations to us. They both argue that we have a system which has been in use for a long time and it should not be changed because it diminishes the rights of the accused. I am perfectly willing to accept that it does diminish the rights of the accused. All I say is that, on experience so far with the provisions of the section carefully calculated to defend the interests of the accused, I do not think it will adversely affect them. I can be as wrong as anyone, and it may be that I am wrong about this. Once before I supported a diminution in the rights of the accused in relation to trial by jury. I was in favour of majority verdicts. I remember once listening at Report stage to an emotional speech by one of my hon. Friends who is now dead, but who was a life-long defender of civil liberties. He not only brought tears to his own eyes, he brought tears to most eyes in the House when he was decrying the diminution of the rights of the accused established since the thirteenth century. I still argued that it was better for the accused to have a trial by jury with the possibility of a majority verdict which would avoid a hung jury and a retrial. Experience since then has proved that I was right, and nobody is now arguing against majority verdicts. Sometimes we have to change our system for reasons that seem compelling and pressing. If I am wrong, and my hon. Friend is right and there is a serious disadvantage to the accused, we can always change it back again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One of us is right now and one is wrong

now. The hon. Gentleman quoted the case of the Nottinghamshire justices two years ago, but the hon. Member for York has produced no statistics to show how many persons are now being granted bail on second and further remands. He blandly assures us that that does not happen often any more. I would take some convincing of that. I should be interested to see statistics to show what has happened in relation to bail on second and further remands in the past two years, as compared with the two years prior to the decision that he quoted. Until there is firm evidence, we should support the position stated by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). I hope that the Committee will think hard before moving from eight days to 28. It is a big jump, the people most affected will be not the able, determined experienced criminals, but those who have somehow got themselves into the system, who are manipulable, who will not want to offend prison officers, not want to put pressure on their legal advisers, and who will be left in prison longer than they should be. I view that prospect with great misgiving. A compromise could have been found between eight and 28 days. That would have reduced the prospects of injustices and of people being kept in prison for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked a great deal about the prisons being overfull and about people being in prison who do not need to be there. Today's debate has been about the people in prison who have not even been convicted. We must remember that. We must ensure, as far as we can, that they are in prison for as short a period as possible. The clause will mean that people will be in prison longer than they should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment, which I tabled at the request of the Central Council for Probation and After-care Committee, and to which I understand my hon. and learned Friend may be sympathetic, is to delete the words " and after-care " from the title of the probation service so that it reverts to its original name before the additional words were added in the mid-1960s when the service took after-care under its wing. Since then aftercare has grown, not diminished, in importance, but the probation service now undertakes other specialist services beyond what might narrowly be termed " probation ". The amendment in no way undermines the significance of after-care but recognises the broadening of the service's functions beyond what can conveniently be enumerated in its title.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) for moving these amendments. The words " after-care " were added to the title of the service to mark the fact that it was taking on new functions in the area of aftercare. I hope that nobody will infer from the dropping of these words, if the amendment is carried— and it has the support of the Government—that the probation service is no longer to be involved with the after-care of offenders. That would certainly not be the case—far from it. Probation officers undertake, and will continue to undertake, a considerable amount of work in the supervision, both statutory and voluntary, of offenders released from custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all those most closely involved with the probation service concur with the proposed change of name—my hon. Friend has referred to the wide support—the Government would not wish to stand in its way. I certainly raise no objection to the amendments. They have the sympathy of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment has the support of the Justices' Clerks' Society and of the National Association of Probation Officers. The schedule will repeal the provisions in the Powers of Criminal Courts Act which enables the court to pass day training centre orders. I understand that that power can be used only in four places where day training centres exist. However, the Justices' Clerks' Society and the probation officers have great faith in the value of day training centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable the court to do two things—it could either pass a day training centre order in an area where such a centre exists, or make a probation order with a condition of attendance at an ordinary day centre. I am speaking in favour of day training centres and ordinary day centres, and the continuation of both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The few existing day training centres were supported very strongly by probation officers when they were first introduced in 1972 and they want to see them maintained because they offer an alternative to custody. I hope that that is something that the Committee would like supported and extended. The day training centres have succeeded largely in continuing to take mainly offenders who would otherwise have been imprisoned. At a time when alternatives to custody have never been more necessary, it seems wrong to repeal the provision that makes
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
them possible. Not only should they be retained, but the Bill should take the opportunity to try to introduce more day training centres to extend them into all our urban connurbations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an extension of ordinary day centres of various types by the probation service and, here again, the probation officers strongly support them. The probation service believes that in many instances voluntary attendance at centres provide the most effective approach in tackling the social problems which would often otherwise lead to imprisonment. Where attendance at a day centre is ordered by a court, it is a substantial interference with the offender's liberty. No one should think that it is an ineffective punishment. Attendance at a day training centre is for 60 days and can prevent an offender from taking employment throughout that period. Where the courts make conditions of day centre attendance, such orders should be specific and limited in law. The existing law provides the framework, and should be retained. There is strong support from the Justices' Clerks' Society and probation officers for both day training centres and day centres as an alternative to custody. I hope that the Minister will accept amendment No. 80.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dabs
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is surprising that the Government wish to take day training centres out of the legislation. For a number of years day training centres, along with community service orders, have been a specific alternative to custodial sentences. Nobody is suggesting that community service orders are not, and will not continue to be, a very satisfactory and useful alternative to custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore surprising that although we have only a few day-training centres, the Government wish to take them out of the legislation. It is difficult to understand why an alternative to a custodial sentence should no longer be one of the punishments that courts can impose on offenders. The day training centres have widespread support. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summer-skill) has mentioned some of the organisations that wish them to be retained. I shall quote from a letter from the Inner London Probation and After-Care Service, sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), in his capacity as chairman of the all-party Penal Affairs Group. The letter expresses great keenness that day training centres should be retained. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Together with Community Servics, Day Training Centres were given a particular place in the legislation and this has emphasised their potential importance as a resource for diverting people from the prison system. With the repeal of Section 4 there is no mention of Day Training Centres at all in any of the legislation."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The London Day Training Centre has been seen by the Courts and the Probation Service as an alternative to custody, and the fear at the moment is that without the supportive legislation this may no longer be the case into the future."</p></blockquote>
That is in a letter from the chief probation officer of the Inner London Probation and After-Care Service, Mr. Graham W. Smith.

	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
Day training centres are different from ordinary day centres, of which there are a number up and down the country. They are not a specific alternative to custody, but are a useful adjunct to the work of the probation service and are run by it. There is a distinction between the two. The day training centres are an alternative to custody and the ordinary day centres help the probation service in its work. Attendance at a day centre is voluntary, and part of the normal approach of the probation service. I hope that the Minister will see his way to changing his alleged intentions in the Bill, and will retain the day training centres. Indeed, there should be more day training centres as they have fully proved their worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal embodied in the clause in no way represents any weakening in the Government's search for and belief in the desirability of non-custodial sentences, where those are consistent with the proper protection of the public. Of course, day training centres provide one example of a non-custodial sentence. The purpose of the amendment is to retain and to extend their use. The concept of a day training centre is to provide full-time intensive training for up to 60 days for the socially inadequate offender, whose criminal activities seem to stem from an inability to cope with the demands of everyday life. It was, therefore, to test that concept—the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) is perfectly right—that the four day training centres were established in different parts of the country. They are at Pontypridd, Sheffield, Liverpool and London and are funded entirely by the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experiment has disclosed significant defects. Because regimes have been directed towards a particular type of offender, the centres have been consistently under-used by the courts. In addition, because of the nature of the intensive training for this type of offender, the staff ratio has been high, and hence it has proved to be an expensive disposal in comparison with the range of other non-custodial disposals. Each 60-day order costs from three to seven times as much as a probation order running for a full year, and from four to 10 times as much as a community service order for a full year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that these day training centres were under-used. I quote a further sentence from the letter from the Inner London probation and after-care service.
	<br><blockquote><p>" At a time when the need to develop alternatives to custody is greater than ever before, and when our centre is running at a higher rate of occupancy than at any time during the last 7 years, I think it is indeed very regrettable there should be this wish to remove section 4."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that there has been an improvement in their use, but what I have not yet had time to say is that it is not proposed that their premises shall be lost. It is proposed that the facilities that they afford will be more readily available for the use of the probation service than is possible under the present rather rigid and strict format. I shall come to that in a moment, and I shall also refer to what was said in his annual report by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
chief probation officer of Mid Glamorgan, which is the area for one of the existing day training centres, Pontypridd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) said, that there has been an improvement in their use. But I was drawing the distinction between the cost that the particular format and high staff ratio impose upon day training centres and other non-custodial options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A significant development has taken place since the day training centres were established—the emergence of day activity centres, of which there are now some 80, as distinct from the four day training centres, throughout England and Wales, administered mostly by the probation service but also within the voluntary service. They cater for a much wider range of offender and a wider, though less intensive, range of training. Accordingly, and after consultation with the probation services in the four areas, it is proposed that the day training centres should be converted to day activity centres. This would not only give greater flexibility so far as the courts and the probation services are concerned, but it would, in addition, allow the best elements of the existing day training centre regimes to be continued and applied to a wider range of offenders. In other words, the Bill would remove the restrictions imposed by sections 4, thus allowing resources to be used to the optimum effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what the hon. Member for Battersea, South said, I might add that the chief probation officer for Mid Glamorgan had this to say in his annual report for 1981:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Although these developments will mean the end of an experiment mounted specifically to offer an alternative to custody for a specialised category of offender, and will be regretted by those familiar with the work of the Day Training Centre, it will nevertheless permit an extension of the use of the Centre "</p></blockquote>
—he is speaking about Pontypridd—
	<br><blockquote><p>" to meet the needs of the Probation Service and of society on a wider base than heretofore. It is intended that the Pontypridd Centre will become far more a resource of the local Service and will prove to be a stimulus indeed, in these difficult times, to community based projects in the Mid Glamorgan Valleys. At the conclusion of the year these matters were under discussion. More constructive use of enforced leisure created by unemployment will certainly be the theme on which future operations will be based."</p></blockquote>
That picks up what the hon. Lady the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) way saying. She said that a time when we are faced with greater pressure than ever before on prison accommodation is not a time to withdraw any non-custodial option. This does not represent a withdrawal of any accommodation at present available from non-custodial options. It does relieve these four premises which are occupied by day training centres from the rigid statutory requirements which formed the basis for the experiment in the first place and enable them to be made available to the probation service on a much wider basis, so that there is advantage rather than disadvantage to the cause of non-custodial options in the provisions of the clause. Probation areas that want to incorporate some of the training facilities that have been developed will be free to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
do so following the repeal of section 4 but at the same time they will not be obliged to adopt the rigid format implied by the provisions of the existing legislation and be required to allocate substantial resources which they might consider could better be offenders through community service or some other activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that, by converting the day training centres to the ordinary type of centres, he was increasing the range of non-custodial options. Nobody would dispute that, but surely the key in our argument has been that we should not take away any existing alternative to custody. By converting these day training centres into ordinary training centres, one is taking away from the courts in those areas the power to have another alternative to custody. To that extent, by taking away the day training centres, there is a danger that there will be more people sent into custody as a consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the argument but I do not think it is very significant because, as I have indicated, it would be open to the probation services to make use of a great part, if not the whole part, of the training facilities at the day training centres. But the rigid statutory requirements that the experiment imposed upon those day training centres will be relaxed. So not only will the premises continue to be available, but in large part the training facilities will continue to be available and, indeed, possibly be developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must not in these days overlook the enormous disparity between the cost of the day training centres and day activity centres. Although very good work has been done in them, one must not forget that they were introduced, and remain, on an experimental basis. I am certain that the balance of advantage lies in the provisions of this clause being implemented, and I very much hope—although I am grateful that the issue has been ventilated as a result of the amendment proposed by the hon. Lady— that those who have had the opportunity to hear what lies behind the Government's thinking will believe that the amendment should not succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I cannot allow this clause to pass without welcoming it. The cause makes it more likely that people should be compensated for criminal damage. I understand that subsection (1A) of clause 44(a) would answer a constituency problem which arose in West Derbyshire about a year ago. Perhaps I could put the problem that arose there to my hon. and learned Friend and ask him if this subsection does indeed answer it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent of mine, a Mr. Pearson in Wirks-worth, had his shop broken into. The offenders were caught, tried and convicted but because they disputed his assessment of the damage that he had suffered the magistrates decided that they were unable to award a compensation order in his favour. I spoke to the magistrates' clerk in Matlock about this and he explained that because of some previous precedents magistrates' courts declined to give compensation orders wherever the amount was disputed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This seemed very unfair to me because the only remedy left to my constituent was to take civil action against the accused, which would have been an impractical measure. I understand that this provision of the clause will remedy that defect, and I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend would confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his welcome to the clause. He is indeed right in what he supposes. The case of his constituent exemplifies the sort of difficulty with which the clause seeks to deal. The ruling by the Court of Appeal recently, that a compensation order should not be made unless the amount clearly has been approved or agreed, is unnecessarily restrictive in practice. The purpose of the new subsection (1A) to section 35 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 is to make it clear that where there is no doubt about liability, the court has discretion to use its judgment in fixing a reasonable amount of compensation to be paid, without necessarily having established the exact value of the loss or damage incurred. I would point out that the Court of Appeal is only interpreting the existing statute, which is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court must consider any relevant evidence or representations presented by the prosecution and the defence, but it need not require the precise value of the less to be proved or agreed. We cannot rule out the possibility that in some exceptional cases there might be such uncertainty about the amount of loss that a court would find it difficult to make any award, but I am convinced that this situation would not arise very often and that the clause goes a long way towards ensuring that the making of a compensation order cannot be frustrated, which it evidently was in my hon. Friend's constituent's case simply by an offender challenging the amount of the damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the interests of the victims of crime deserve a good deal more consideration than statute law has up to now permitted, and this is an example of our acting upon that belief. The clause will enable magistrates to make a compensation order much more readily than they do at present. We feel that the time has come to enable the courts to treat the compensation order as a penalty in its own right in suitable cases. Therefore, it will allow a court to make a compensation order either instead of or in addition to dealing with the offender in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for what my hon. Friend has said by welcome, I believe the clause is a very useful part cf the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to oppose the clause, but there are some points that I should like the Minister to consider. The clause is opposed by the National Association of Probation Officers and by the British Association of Social Workers. No doubt he has studied carefully their views on the clause and why they oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The probation officers are concerned that the juvenile courts would use community service for
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
16-year-olds very freely, without adhering to the principle that it should be an alternative to custody, and the extension of the idea to 16-year-olds would dilute the idea of community service as a realistic alternative to custody for adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point was about the finance. As the Committee knows, the probation service is not replete with money. It is constantly short of funds. Yet here is a proposal which would clearly need additional resources. In the Bill there is no mention of the cost of this exercise. The explanatory memorandum says, in relation to the probation service and the extra cost involved, that it is not possible to quantify this, which is worrying. Either efforts have been made to quantify it, which have failed, or no effort was made on the grounds that it was for some reason regarded as impossible to quantify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a proposal which will need more resources. Does it mean, as the probation officers fear, that these resources will have to be taken from existing schemes, which they are already having great difficulty in trying to run? If not, if the existing schemes are not to suffer, clearly additional resources will have to be provided for this new proposal. If so, how much? Tt is better to have no new scheme than to have a scheme which is run on inadequate funds or which has to be run at the sacrifice of existing schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kiiroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene, but since my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) has cast some doubt on whether the extension of community service orders to 16-year-olds should be welcomed, I think it is appropriate that I should make it clear that I support the clause and this proposal. It was a recommendation of the report of the all-party Penal Affairs Group, " Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future ". 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of the representations that have been made to the Committee by the British Association of Social Workers and the National Association of Probation Officers. I know and understand the fears that have been partially expressed by my hon. Friend, which are held by those organisations. But I do not share their view. I do not accept the view that has been put forward by NAPO that if community service orders are extended to 16-year-olds in effect the tariff will be lowered and that therefore the credibility or the attractiveness of community service orders to the courts as an option or an alternative to a custodial sentence will be reduced. I do not accept that. It certainly would not be the case if amendment No. 82, which I have tabled, and the amendment of my hon. Friend—amendment No. 52—were accepted. Those two amendments would ensure that a community service order could not be imposed unless it was a clear alternative to a custodial sentence, so clearly the credibility and the attractiveness of community service orders to the courts would be enhanced, and the fears of my hon. Friend and those of the probation service would not be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the probation service has fears that the courts may find community service orders less attractive because they are now regarded as appropriate for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
16-year-olds, the remedy lies in their hands. It is the probation service which has to make the report to the court as to whether or not a particular offender is considered to be an appropriate person on which a community service order should be imposed, and the courts are required to take that report into consideration. Therefore, one would expect that the probation service would ensure the viability and the attractiveness of community service orders by recommending that they be imposed only on those 16-year-olds who would otherwise have received a custodial sentence and who in all the circumstances are considered fit persons on whom the order should be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I welcome clause 45 and in particular its extension to 16-year-olds as another potential means of reducing the number of custodial sentences, particularly those imposed upon juveniles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) and Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) who have spoken on this matter. I too am well aware of the disquiet of the National Association of Probation Officers. When I went to the conference of BASW at Malvern last summer, misgivings were expressed to me on that occasion. On the other hand, I am fortified by the support of the chief probation officers for the proposal, and one cannot overlook that. It is significant that in Scotland 16-year-olds are subject to community service orders of up to 240 hours maximum. Here the proposal is that it will be 120 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that overriding difficulties have been experienced in Scotland. We believe that the great success of community service orders, with well
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
over 20,000 being made last year, as a non-custodial form of disposal, justifies us in extending it from the present threshold of 17 years down to 16 years. I am fortified by the support of the hon. Member for Ormskirk for this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible as yet to make an estimate of what it will cost, because we do not know how many cases the courts will think it appropriate to make, but in those circumstances, it is a case of building upon success, and this is a proper measure to take.
