	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT GRANTS TO REDUNDANT CHURCHES FUND ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment (Mr. Charles R. Morris)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members have seen the memorandum, but I should explain that this is a subject which will, I hope, commend itself to the Committee. The purpose of the draft statutory instrument is to enable the Government to make further and continuing contributions to the Redundant Churches Fund for the period ending 31st March 1979. This fund was set up under the Pastoral Measure 1968 with the object of preserving, in the interests of the nation and the Church of England, churches of historic and architectural interest which are no longer required for public worship and for which no other suitable use can be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church Commissioners were empowered by the Pastoral Measure 1968 to make grants to the fund of up to £200,000 in the first period which ended on 31st March 1974 and to apply one-third of the net proceeds of sales of redundant churches up to a total of £100,000. The Redundant Churches and Other Religious Buildings Act 1969 empowered my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State during the same period to make grants not exceeding £200,000 to the fund. This procedure has enabled about 40 redundant historic churches of the Church of England to be vested in the fund, thus ensuring that this part of our great national heritage shall be preserved for the nation for all time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church Commissioners are prepared to continue in the same proportion for the period ending 31st March 1979. In February 1974 the General Synod of the Church of England approved an order enabling a maximum contribution of £700,000 to be paid to the fund provided
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
an equivalent amount is contributed out of moneys provided by Parliament. I am referring to the actual proportion, which is 40 per cent. by the Exchequer, 40 per cent. by the Church Commissioners and 20 per cent. from sales of sites of redundant churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution needed for the current period is, of necessity, considerably higher than in the first quinquennium. First, because of the steep rise in the cost of repairing the churches for which the fund becomes responsible, including the addition of VAT at 10 per cent. Secondly, it is estimated that a further 100 churches will go to the fund during the present quinquennium. This is based on the information provided by the church authorities, and it is also in keeping with the estimates made by the commission appointed by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York in 1958 under the chairmanship of Lord Bridges to consider the problem of redundant churches which have claim to preservation on historical or architectural grounds and to make recommendations as to the procedures for handling such matters and the financial problems involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its report, the Bridges Commission estimated that the fund might be asked to accept responsibility for 300 to 400 redundant churches during the first 15 to 20 years of the fund's establishment. Many of the recommendations in that report were incorporated in the Pastoral Measure 1968, including the setting up of the Redundant Churches Fund and also the advisory board, whose members are appointed by the Archbishops and the Prime Minister, to advise the Church Commissioners about the historic and architectural qualities of churches to be declared redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Helping to preserve historic churches is not controversial in a party sense. As long ago as July 1964, the then Minister of Public Building and Works stated that the Government would contribute up to £200,000 to the fund for the first five years on the understanding that the Church Commissioners provided an equivalent amount from their own resources. Despite the present economic situation, it is not considered that there would be any justification for abrogating the principle that the Government should continue contributions. I should perhaps explain that payments from the £700,000
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
would be made at intervals to the fund as and when its accounts showed that these were needed, and provided the Church Commissioners made an equal payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, this draft statutory instrument to provide up to £700,000 from Government funds for the second quinquennium of the Redundant Churches Fund, for which an affirmative resolution is sought today, is the minimum required to continue the task and privilege of preserving for future generations those gems of our architectural heritage which, but for the provisions of the Pastoral Measure 1968 and the work and expertise of the Advisory Board for Redundant Churches and the Redundant Churches Fund, would, in very many instances, be lost to the nation for all time. To do other than lend financial support to such a project would be to abrogate responsibility for the preservation of this very important part of our national heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.7 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, but I want to give this order my absolute support and to congratulate the Minister on what he said this morning. I am sure that there will be no dissention in either this Committee or the House about the essential importance of this order. It transcends all party and religious barriers, and it is a measure of the utmost importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the Minister referred in his closing remarks to the advisory board. The board and its indefatigable secretary, Miss Margot Eates, deserve the congratulations of the nation for what they have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of this matter can be underlined by anybody who crosses the road to St. John's Church, Smith Square. It is a wonderful example of one of the prime pieces of ecclesiastical architecture of the eighteenth century, now put to a different but fitting use. Without the foresight of those who produced changes in the law about ten years ago, such a thing would not have been possible. Many churches which are no longer capable of being used for their original religious purpose can be saved and put to fitting use in places such as Norwich, York, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Having said that, and endorsing entirely what the Minister said, I should like to add one or two points of caution. In the next quinquennium, it will be necessary to consider whether we can speed up the process from time to time. I appreciate that that is not entirely within the Minister's control, but there have been one or two unfortunate cases of churches falling into an advanced state of decay, and even being demolished in one or two instances. In a case at Bingley last year, a slightly more expeditious use of the measure could have averted disaster. I hope that there will be consultations between the appropriate authorities to see whether something can be done to avert another Bingley. I know that the advisory board was extremely disturbed about it, and although many of us got together and wrote letters to 
	<i>The Times,</i> it was all to no avail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that I want to mention—I shall not expand on this, Miss Quennell, because it would be out of order to do so—is VAT, to which the Minister referred. The hon. Gentleman spoke of an increased allowance to take account of VAT. That is fine as far as it goes, but I believe that there is an unanswerable case for removing VAT from repairs to historic buildings, and churches in particular. I hope that the Minister will lend his advocacy to this cause. I am certain that he is basically sympathetic towards it, and I hope that he will build upon his speech this morning and discuss this matter with his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although this draft instrument is important and we all unite in welcoming it, there remains, nevertheless, a much wider problem surrounding historic churches. Britain has the finest single collection of historic buildings in Europe. Almost all mediaeval buildings that have survived in this country are of an ecclesiastical nature. There are nearly 8,000 mediaeval historic churches in Britain. Of necessity, and I hope that this will remain the case, very few of those will be declared redundant and therefore be eligible for the kind of funds that we have voted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remain many more churches, devotedly cared for by their parishioners and guarded by their incumbents, which are not yet eligible for any sort of State aid. I have pressed this matter ever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
since I came to the House four years ago. I have had four Private Member's Bills on this subject—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And one Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —and one Committee stage, as the Minister says, but I hope that before long we can extend the admirable scheme about which we have been talking so as to make eligible buildings of outstanding architectural historic importance which are still used for their religious purpose but which, for obvious reasons, are beyond the means of their congregations and their incumbents to maintain if a major disaster strikes them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the order wholeheartedly. I thank the Minister for what he said, and I express the hope that we shall always have his advocacy in this extremely civilised cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.13 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found myself on this Committee this morning rather by accident. I am delighted to add my warm support to the purpose of the order, but I should like to ask one or two questions. This is not out of any antagonism to the purpose of the order, but merely for my own information and that of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, can the Minister say how much money has been given in grants for this purpose since the fund was first established? Secondly, when a redundant church qualifies for a grant, in many cases it will be a church for which there is no other purpose. In the more remote parts of the country, where it is unlikely to be used except by occasional visitors, there is the problem of annual maintenance. Does the grant contain a sum which enables that building to be kept in order? We all know that buildings deteriorate rapidly if they are not cared for daily and are not in use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is the grant given only to churches for which there is alternative use—the church nearby, to which reference has already been made, which is now used for concerts is a case in point—or is it given also to churches which have no conceivable alternative use? I know of one or two churches in remote rural areas in my own constituency which, once they have ceased to be used for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
original denominational purpose, will find no use whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the grant is given for a church of that kind, what happens if later on, for one reason or another, a use is found for it? Perhaps it could be put to some community use or, as has happened on occasion, it could be converted to a private house. I assume that the grant would then cease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one other matter which my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South-West (Mr. Cormack) mentioned in his remarks, namely, the aid that is to be given to churches that are still in use. My hon. Friend referred to the devoted care of parishioners and the priests in charge of these churches. I wish this were true. In many cases, the devoted parishioners are a mere handful of people for whom the burden is far too great and these churches, many of which are architectural gems, are rapidly falling into disuse because the very small number of workers in that area just cannot raise the necessary money, and the parish priest probably has three or four churches to look after and cannot give much time to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend in hoping that we might perhaps be able to extend the purpose of this fund to help churches of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the points made by my two hon. Friends. I welcome the terms in which the Minister has proposed this order, but it does beg some of the questions. As my hon. Friend said many of our most important churches—i.e. from an architectural point of view—are in the depths of the country, with small congregations, and I believe that there is a strong case, on architectural and historical grounds, for helping those congregations and the church authorities to keep their buildings in better repair than they are able to do at the moment by their own resources whether from central church funds or local funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's whole approach to this problem, but I think that we ought to reconsider now, because it will take time to change attitudes on this, the claims of the most important of those churches which still have a limited use and limited congregations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
My second point is that I doubt whether funds of the size that have been discussed today will prove anywhere near adequate in the years ahead. Should not the Government take over the entire financial responsibility for those redundant churches which the archbishops and the Government together agree should be maintained as part of our cultural heritage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Countries on the continent provide heavy financial support for the greatest of their historic buildings. I believe that we have a store of fine buildings, especially among the churches, which is comparable to anything in Western Christendom. I believe that we should begin to take full financial responsibility for those buildings which have become redundant and go into level partnership with the Anglican Church itself over the preservation of some of those still active churches which are also pre-eminent in their cultural and architectural value but are unable to find the funds required for their proper maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir John Hall: Does my hon. Friend not agree that but considerable aid from America and overseas generally several of our national churches would have fallen into ruin long ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; I think particularly, of course, the Pilgrim Trust. But we should not be dependent upon reinforcements from outside even though some of the communities overseas have strong family links with this country. I believe that it is part of our national pride and that we, from our own resources, should keep these buildings for the enjoyment and the wonder of people who visit this country from all parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end I make two pleas. First, that the provisions on the terms announced today should be reviewed with the purpose of the Government taking over, in due course, full financial responsibility for those churches that have become redundant—always with the proviso that if there is a change in public participation in the work of the Anglican church those churches could be reopened as centres of Anglican worship, because I hope that day may yet come. Secondly, that we should extend the provisions of the fund to churches that are not yet redundant but are unable to carry out proper maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>12.21 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Marcus Worsley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like to join in welcoming this order and the way in which the Minister presented it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to the success of the working of this procedure has been that a complete distinction has been drawn between, on the one hand, the pastoral needs of a church in an area which may indicate that a particular building is no longer needed for worship and, on the other, the architectural merits. By drawing this distinction it has been possible to satisfy, on the whole, both those within the Church who are concerned at the amount of the Church's resources that go towards the maintenance of buildings, and those, in and out of the Church, who value its architectural heritage. The machinery has therefore worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to note in the last report of the Redundant Churches Fund a reference to—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the smooth working of the Measure in the great majority of instances and the close harmony that has prevailed in the past year between the Fund and the Commissioners."</p></blockquote>
That is encouraging. Another thing that is encouraging, in a different way, is the fact that fewer churches have become redundant than was expected. The truth is that more churches are being kept as living churches. Surely we all agree that a church of architectural merit is better as a working church than as a museum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond briefly to some of the remarks made by my hon. Friends. I agree that the time must be near when State funds—central Government funds—must contribute towards the maintenance of our historic churches but, as an ex-commissioner, may I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Sir J. Hall) that there are no central funds of the Church of England available for the maintenance of churches. The funds of the Church Commissioners are by statute applied entirely to salaries and pensions. It is therefore important to realise that when money is raised by the Church of England it is raised locally and not from its central sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am involved as a trustee of the York Minister fund. We raised £2 million for the saving of York Minster, of which 80 per cent. came from the county of Yorkshire. We received nothing from central Government, but we did receive a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
penny rate from all the county authorities in Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that I completely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair) that the State should take over this responsibility. I do not believe that that would be right. As a trustee of the York Minster Fund. I saw the extraordinary response from people in the locality to save their cathedral. Therefore, I believe that what is needed is not that the State should take over responsibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was only to redundant churches that my remarks applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Worsley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, because I had misunderstood my hon. Friend. I am glad that we are in agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in the Historic Buildings Council, which was formed, for secular buildings, exactly the right machinery, and it could easily be adapted to help churches. State help must always help people to help themselves, but it must not be a substitute for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the order, and I hope that the Committee will agree to its terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.26 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might comment on one or two of the matters that have been raised. I join in the congratulations offered by the hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-West (Mr. Cormack) for the splendid work done by the Advisory Board for Redundant Churches. I endorse everything that he said in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman's comments about the former St. John's Church in Smith Square. Having attended concerts there, I know that it has a splendid atmosphere and is a splendid example of a church building being put to a civilised and most attractive use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed the need for caution in our approach to the second quinquennium with regard to the Redundant Churches Fund. He suggested that we might speed up the process because of what he described as the advanced state of decay of individual churches. We are mindful of this, and I am sure that those who control the Fund will give serious consideration to what he said. I might add that the Town and
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Country Amenities Bill, which has been dealt with by the House, might help in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman commented on VAT, and he suggested that redundant churches presented an unanswerable case for relieving religious authorities of the burden of VAT. I shall bring these comments to the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's final point concerned the real problem affecting churches which are still in use but which are in need of repair. In this regard, I should refer to the Working Party of the General Synod of the Church of England which is examining ways in which churches in use can be helped financially by means of repair. The Department and I, as the Minister, have an open mind on the subject, and I am prepared to consider any views which the working party makes available and submit them to the appropriate Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; my officials and I are certainly prepared to have informal discussions. If individual members of the Committee have views to express, I am only too eager to listen to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Sir J. Hall) about the generosity of an individual American organisation and of individual citizens of the United States and other countries, who have contributed so much financially towards helping us to conserve our architectural heritage in church building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It ought to be put on the record that the Historic Churches Preservation Trust—I am privileged to sit on its Grants Committee—has given £2 million over 20 years, and almost all that money has been raised in this country. It is the one central body concerned with giving grants to churches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir J. Hall</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order to have an intervention in an intervention. Perhaps the Minister will resume his speech and then there can be another intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Wycombe (Sir J. Hall).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand rebuked, Miss Quennell. I merely wanted to correct what may have been a false impression. I was trying to point out that it was rather disgraceful that we should have to depend upon considerable aid from overseas. We should be able to find the funds ourselves for the maintenance of our own historic churches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the view which the hon. Gentleman has just expressed. As I indicated earlier, the working party is considering how we can effectively help in the repair of church buildings, but its report is not yet available. As soon as it is, we shall be able to consider the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wycombe asked three questions. First, he asked how much money had actually been spent from the Redundant Churches Fund? As the memorandum that was made available to members of the Committee indicated, the amount spent so far is £200,000 of Government money. Naturally, the Church has made available the remaining £300,000. In fact, the Redundant Churches Fund is coming to an end, and that is the justification for and basis of the instrument that we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then inquired about the maintenance of churches. This is covered by the Redundant Churches Fund itself. The cost of repairs to redundant churches is met directly from the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked what was the position with regard to churches in use. I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts that I covered that in reply to comments made by his hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South-West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the view of the hon. Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair) that in terms of architectural merit we have churches that are comparable to anything in Western Christendom. The hon. Member is absolutely right in saying what he did about these buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then suggested that in order to take account of the fact that changes in attitudes will involve time, we should go ahead with trying to influence
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
public opinion and the Government to make more money available and to take more positive action to preserve and conserve this aspect of our architectural heritage. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are seized of the need for urgency in this matter and that we shall proceed as fast as it is humanly possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the suggestion that the Government should take over entire responsibility for redundant churches, I hope that on reflection the hon. Member will reconsider his views in that regard. I question whether the Church would endorse that view in its entirety. I do not think it can really be suggested that a Department of State should take absolute responsibility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir G. Sinclair</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Financial responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —even financial responsibility, because it throws up a number of consequential points which emerged during the Committee stage of the Town and Country Amenities Bill, on Clauses 5 and 6 of that Bill, where the Church itself was interested in the development site values of redundant churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes that sort of access to revenue away from the churches, one might in the process create particular financial difficulties for the Church of England. Even though I accept that it was a reasonable proposition to advance, I hope that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will hesitate before endorsing it in its entirety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal, finally, with the remarks of the hon. Member for Chelsea (Sir Mr. Worsley). He suggested that the Church had a problem in having this tremendous heritage of 11,000 church buildings of architectural merit when essentially it is concerned with the pastoral needs of the communities which the Church seeks to serve. My hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Mr. Bishop) put it rather graphically when he explained that the Church was in business to preach the gospel and not to take care of individual buildings of architectural merit, and there is some validity in that attitude of mind. However, we are mindful of the Church's difficulties in this regard, and we are endeavouring to help in a variety of different ways. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance about that.

It has been delightful to serve on this Committee and to find so much common concern and common ground over the problem of helping religious orders of all denominations to preserve part of the nation's architecture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
