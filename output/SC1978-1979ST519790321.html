	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Michael Meacher)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Cinematograph Films (Limits of Levy) Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
I wish to stress at the outset that this draft order arises simply as a result of a general increase in the level of admission prices to cinemas and, above all, I am glad to say, from a most welcome upturn in cinema attendances. It does not represent any fundamental change of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order amends section 2(3)(
	<i>b</i>) of the, Cinematograph Films Act 1957. This Act gave statutory force to the collection of the levy on cinema seats—widely known as the Eady levy—which is a proportion of the admission price paid in respect of all public cinema performances, with certain exceptions. Cinemas are exempt from levy in any week when their takings do not exceed a certain threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This levy is therefore not a Government aid, but is what might be called "trade" money. It is collected by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and paid to the British Film Fund Agency, a body established under the 1957 Act. Out of the proceeds the agency, with the approval of the Secretary of State, makes grants to certain bodies connected with the film industry. These are the Children's Film Foundation, the British Film Institute, the National Film School and the National Film Finance Corporation, on behalf of the National Film Development Fund. The balance is then paid by the agency to the makers of eligible British films—or, in effect, so often to their distributor—in proportion to the current earnings of those films in the domestic market, in order to encourage British film production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Act was passed, Parliament wished the levy to be neither so small as to be of little benefit to the industry, nor so large as to be an unreasonable burden. Consequently the Act specified that the estimated annual yield should be greater than£2 million but less than£5 million.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Section 5(1) of the Films Act 1970 provided that these limits could be varied by order made by statutory instrument. By 1975—I ask hon. Members to note this point—the true value of that£5 million laid down in 1970 was estimated to be about£13 million and it was therefore decided in that year to raise the upper limit to bring it a little nearer its original value, and it was increased to£7 million—as hon. Members will see, a modest increase when compared with the real value in 1970. This was said at the time to be sufficient to cater for any increases in the general level of prices over the following two years. But it is now necessary to increase the upper limit again, but with one important qualification to which I shall return in a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levy year is a period of 52 consecutive weeks. Last year it ran from 25 September 1977 to 23 September 1978, and the total levy collected was about£6½ million—very close to the upper limit of£7 million. In the first 23 weeks of the current levy year the sum collected was approximately£700,000 above that of the same period last year. Clearly, therefore, if this rate of increase were to continue, the present upper limit of£7 million would be exceeded this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enabling legislation provides that the Secretary of State may make a variation in the levy yield, but that he should first consult his statutory advisory body the Cinematograph Films Council, which includes representatives of all sections of the industry. The council's advice was that the present maximum yield should be raised and this advice has been accepted. The order therefore provides that the upper limit of the levy yield be raised, by amending section 2(3)(
	<i>b</i>) of the 1957 Act by substituting for£7 million the sum of£12 million. This raising of the ceiling will not increase in any way the rate at which the levy is collected from cinemas. I emphasise that point, because I know that there has been concern on it. It does not in any way increase the rate at which the levy is collected from cinemas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to me that there are various other ways of dealing with this problem. It has been said, for example, that we could adjust the rate of the levy on each ticket, or raise the exemption threshold in order to produce a lower yield. In response to requests from the industry for relief to cinemas we have in fact made such adjustments two years running. In the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
year 1977–78 and in the current year 1978–79 these adjustments were calculated to produce an estimated reduction in the total yield of£1 million. Despite these reliefs, the total yield has risen, partly as a product of higher prices, but, and most gratifyingly, as I mentioned earlier, because of a recent strong upturn in cinema attendances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, it has been suggested that we could suspend the collection of the levy when the£7 million ceiling was reached— not that one would want to approach that ceiling too closely, as the levy is collected fortnightly and the total is not known to us until several days later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think, however, that we should again tinker with the collection of levy in any of the several ways that have been suggested, because we do not know enough about the ability of cinemas, particularly the independents or small groups, to pay the levy at the present rate, nor indeed at any other rate. For this reason some months ago I put in hand a series of moves that will give us information about the levy that has never been available before. The important qualification to this proposed increase in the maximum levy yield that I mentioned earlier is that it is only an interim measure to cover the period while we collect and digest the information now coming to us, consult with interested parties and decide whether changes should be made in the levy system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could indicate what these moves are. First, my Department is sharing with a number of trade associations the cost of a very thorough investigation by an independent firm of accountants into the ability of cinemas of different types in different circumstances to pay the levy. The accountants' report should be with us in the next few weeks and it would be quite wrong at this point to pre-empt the findings of this investigation by making any arbitrary alteration in the present rate of levy before their report has been most carefully considered by all the parties to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as hon. Members will no doubt have seen, I have arranged for the publication of the levy distribution in respect of individual films, the details of which have up to now never been published. The first two such publications have now appeared covering the 14 weeks from 24 September to 30 December 1978 and subsequent publications will appear at 4 or 5-weekly intervals. The names of some of the films benefiting from levy
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
distributions have attracted attention in the press. It is all to the good that these matters be brought into the open, as there can be no intelligent debate about levy without this information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry is now considering the subject of levy and is to make a recommendation. I am also expecting to receive the views of the Cinematograph Films Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the next few months therefore a lot of new material will be coming to hand, together with the opinions which can take these new facts into account. It is my intention to consider all this new information most carefully and to consult with interested parties. I expect our conclusions to be given effect either in a separate measure, or in a wider measure to give effect to the statement of policy which we shall shortly make on our future plans for the industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I do not believe that we should engage at this time in any short-term fine tuning of the system, about which I have doubts on a number of grounds. I therefore seek as an interim measure—I emphasise that—this increase in the maximum limit of film levy to permit collection and distribution to continue meanwhile without interruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this order is to amend section 2(3)(6) of the Cinematograph Films Act 1957 by increasing from £7 million to£12 million the ceiling on the estimated yield of the levy on cinema seats. The Minister has described this as an interim measure. We know that the levy is a proportion of the admission price paid for cinema seats and that, because of the rise in admission prices, coupled with the very welcome recent upturn in cinema attendances, there have been significant increases in the amount of levy collected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that if present trends continue, it is most probable that the upper limit or ceiling of£7 million will be exceeded in the current levy year, and that consequently the ceiling must be adjusted. The Minister told us this morning that it is up by£700,000 on the first 23 weeks of the current levy year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before the Secretary of State can vary the limits of the annual levy yield, he must first consult the Cinematograph Films Council. That he has done. We are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
also told that the council has advised that the present maximum yield of the levy should be raised from£7 million to£12 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it proposed to raise the ceiling to£12 million when the levy is, I understand, now bringing in about£7 million. "The Minister said that the original ceiling was fixed in 1970 and that by 1975 it should have been about£13 million to take account of changes that have taken place during that period. I cannot help wondering whether it is "overkill" to increase the figure from£7 million to£13 million bearing in mind the present level at which the levy is running and the adjustments which have taken place over the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not have a ceiling of, say,£9 million, or£10 million at the most, bearing in mind the actual rate at which the levy is running, following the adjustments. It will be interesting to hear how the Minister settled on the figure of£13 million— whether it was proposed by his Department or a recommendation received from the Cinematograph Films Council itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the levy or Eady money, as it was known in the days when I worked in the film industry, is interesting. Although the levy is collected by Customs and Excise, it is paid over to the British Film Fund Agency, which allocates money to a number of bodies. T understand that in the last year the Children's Film Foundation has received£574,625. The foundation has done very good work over the years and has been mainly responsible for those very entertaining Saturday matinees which took place when most hon. Members were boys, who will remember seeing films as a result of the money which came from the Eady fund through the British Film Fund Agency to the Children's Film Foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Film Institute this year received£36,300, which is very small beer. Does the Minister anticipate any increase in the money paid to the British Film Institute in the coming year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Film School received£150,000, and the National Film Finance Corporation receives money for the Script Development Fund. How much has been received by the NFFC for the Script Development Fund in the past year? That fund was discussed in the House some time ago and it would be interesting to know how much money is going into it and what progress is being made in en-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
couraging young British scriptwriters to develop their talents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I think it would be interesting if the Minister could tell the Committee how much is to be paid to the National Film School during the coming year. Will it remain at around£150,000, or does he anticipate an increase?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important payments made by the British Film Fund Agency is that which goes to British film producers. How many British films have been produced in the past year with the benefit of payments from the levy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister say that more information will be available shortly and that he will be publishing details of the films which have benefited from the levy. As the Minister said, there has been a good deal of adverse criticism about the type of films which are benefiting, and I believe that Parliament should consider this information in relation to the operation of the levy scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pursue the question of assistance being given to the specialised film producers who make industrial films, or documentary films as they are more widely known, which are often shown in public cinemas as supporting films. Originally when I was in the film industry these films used to qualify for a multiplier of the Eady money, but that was some time ago, and I wonder what is the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee whether encouragement is being given to the production of specialised industrial and documentary type films, which contribute very substantially to public entertainment in the cinemas as well as helping to support the smaller producers who, in turn, tend to gravitate to feature film production. It has been quite widely accepted in the past that many of the best feature film producers started their careers in the specialised film industry, which was certainly booming in the 1960s and into the early 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient encouragement is being given to the smaller producers compared to the feature film producers who, it is reported, have been producing films which are not entirely what the originators of the Eady fund had in mind at the time it was conceived?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased to hear about the accountancy inquiry which is to be carried out with the film trade associations. I hope that the inquiry will go into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
profitability of cinema exhibitors and will have in mind the very serious problems now faced by many small exhibitors, despite the very welcome upturn in cinema admissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in general the Opposition support the levy and the increase in the ceiling, but it will be helpful to have a little more information than the Minister gave in his opening remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss the order because I believe that Parliament needs to examine where the so-called Eady money has gone. The last annual report of the British Film Fund Agency available to Parliament, printed in July last year, does not give many details, but simply sets out its bare statutory requirements in a way that is not particularly helpful to Members of Parliament in their examination of the proposals as they are brought before the Committeee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend to ensure that future annual reports of the British Film Fund Agency, in explaining where the Eady money goes, should at least give some indication of why it is satisfied that the money has been distributed in the way authorised. It is not satisfactory to say that£499,675 was distributed to the Children's Film Foundation and that the agency was satisfied that the money was properly required for the activities of the foundation. It would be helpful to have a brief review of those activities. I believe that there is general agreement that the Children's Film Foundation provides a very useful and valuable purpose, but at the same time the information given is somewhat sparse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say, in contrast, that my hon. Friend deserves congratulations on revealing some of the information about where the Eady money goes. This is a long overdue reform and it is quite staggering to think that the Eady money has been paid for so long without any individual allocations ever being divulged in the way authorised at present. It illustrates the fact that if one provides information, far from inhibiting discussion, it develops it and enables it to take place on a much better and more informed basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worthwhile making a brief comment about the list of recipients of the Eady money so far. There has been an amount of concern in the industry, expressed in
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the correspondence columns of "Screen International" regarding the allocation of the Eady money to distributors and not producers. It is interesting that the allocation of the money has shown up some of the warped ways in which the automatic nature of the fund produces its allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed that the money goes to distributors instead of producers. It has been pointed out that some distributors engage in the finance of production as well as distribution. On the other hand, one commentator said in the edition of "Screen International" of 17 March:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There remains, however, a significant number of cases where the distributor has demanded a share in Eady towards recovery of his costs as a condition for taking the film—this is a genuine abuse and I, for one, tried to persuade the BFPA to make a rule forbidding its members to enter into this type of agreement. However, it was the very type of independently-financed producer who is most vulnerable that refused such a restriction. These producers felt that inability to trade in their Eady entitlement might deny them distribution for a "difficult "picture. This area remains open to abuse and requires attention."</p></blockquote>
That is true. The Eady money was designed to assist independent British producers. It appears that in some instances, not unfortunately quoted in the letter, those very people are having to forego the Eady money because of pressure from the commanding position of the distributor. That is one point which deserves the attention of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that the automatic nature of the allocation of the funds produces, and has recently produced, some interesting illustrations of the sort of warping effect that I mentioned. For example, the short film "Hot Wheels" received£122,901 compared with the feature "Wild Geese", which received£138,984; and the feature "Midnight Express" which received£40,389 over the period for the publication of the first results. The reason that "Hot Wheels" received that amount of money was by virtue of the quirk that it was distributed with "Grease", which happened to be an enormously successful feature film.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that arises is that the allocation of that money was made to a distributor, CIC. It wrote to " Screen International " to say that, although there was a large amount of money paid for a comparatively low-cost short, far and away outweighing the cost of feature film production, nevertheless that money was to be divided between Paramount—which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
was to start on a short film production programme—and the British film producer of " Hot Wheels". It did not, however, say precisely what that division was to be. Quite clearly in that instance, the producer of a short film may not wish to cavil at any distribution, as it is the distributor, who decides that "Hot Wheels" goes out with "Grease" and who therefore receives£122,000, and not the producer. That relationship needs close examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Eady money is designed to go to British film producers in order to sustain and retain an indigenous film industry, does the Minister think that the definition "a British film" needs tightening. Well-known American companies are named in the published list of fund allocations. Of course it is their British enterprises which receive the money, but at the same time we must recognise that the successive crisis in the British film industry has been largely due to the fact that we have depended too often on the investment of foreign capital which, for one reason or another, has been arbitrarily changed, withdrawn or deferred. The Eady fund is failing if it does not ensure that the money goes to a genuine indigenous British production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder, too, as the automatic basis of the fund produces allocations to all sorts of films, whether there is not a need to allocate the Eady fund on the basis of, for example, artistic merit. I know that that is vague and controversial. Nevertheless, in France, for example, there is a supplement to the automatic basis of their levy arrangements for films of particular merit. One could obviate criticism about leaving certain films to the vagaries of artistic merit, and thereby excluding some films entirely, by saying that, if certain films are of a worthwhile nature, they should receive a supplement. That would give direct financial encouragement to films of good quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the investigation into the industry and the ability of independent exhibitors to pay the levy. We need to examine the position of the distributors in relation to exhibition. The aliance of exhibition and distribution means that two powerful organisations, EMI and Rank, in effect have complete oligopolistic control of exhibition in this country. Sometimes that power tends to be exercised in an arbitrary
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
way. It is worth remembering that what I regard as an extremely worthwhile film such as "Kes" nearly received no distribution at all. Indeed, it was given a West End distribution only by virtue of pressure and the very quality of the film.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is true also of another British film, made many years before—" Saturday Night and Sunday Morning "That film has received many accolades, but it was regarded by the distributors as a tiny, eccentric, Left-wing film which could not possibly be given distribution. In the same way, "Kes" was regarded with concern by the distributors because it contained Yorkshire people speaking with Yorkshire accents. It was felt that "Kes" could not possibly be understood by the millions of people who live south of Potters Bar— indeed, south of Doncaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Independent Producers has suggested that the position of independent exhibitors might well be examined. Although the Eady money is to encourage independent production, independent production is meaningless without exhibition. There might therefore be merit in the suggestion, which the association has made, that cinemas that show films of merit and embark on a quality programme—dispensing, for example, with the " The Lusty Vicar " and other such productions, and concentrating on quality—might receive exemption from the Eady levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has said that this is an interim measure. I understand that. But, once the interim measure is passed, as I assume it will be, if we are to sustain a British industry in the longer term we must look at all out options. I should have thought that exemption from the Eady levy for cinemas with distinct and defined policies of quality and merit might be worth considering. That in itself would help British independent production, because it would give exhibition when distributors might not be prepared to give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in cinema takings is extremely welcome. But the industry is dominated by the two distributors and exhibitors, and that will not end until we take seriously the possibility of having one chain of cinemas, in either municipal or public ownership, to ensure that the oligopoly is at least partly owned in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The publication of the report, which my hon. Friend has mentioned, on the ability of cinemas to pay will, I hope, enable us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
to have even more informed discussion. Will the Minister ensure that the accountants' report is published? Some cinemas might say "Our financial arrangements are confidential". If that is the position, could I ask him to ensure that the general arrangements for the report are published, and that the confidential commercial arrangements are deleted from the report, so that we get the general position, and so that the report is not denied to Parliament and the greater part of the public because a dozen pages out of about 50 involve detailed commercial matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend by publishing the Eady allocation has contributed greatly to the informed discussion of the British film industry, and I hope that his examination can also make a contribution by publication as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Durant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by declaring an interest in the British Film Producers Association. I do not usually agree with the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer), but on this occasion I agree with 99 per cent, of his remarks, except on the last point, to which I shall come to later. He touched on many of the problems of the film industry and his speech is worthy of note in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the measure. I note that it is an interim measure, and I accept it on that basis. I certainly welcome the support for the Children's Film Foundation, although the hon. Member was somewhat critical of that, in the sense that he wanted to know more about it. What the Children Film Foundation does is fairly open knowledge and there should be no difficulty in acquiring that information. It is a very open organisation which provides a useful and imaginative service. I have never had difficulty in discovering what it is doing. I should like to support it and I should also like to support the BFI and the money that goes there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the National Film School, I am sometimes worried that the film industry, which backs that school, does a great deal to further the television industry. Many of those who go through the Film School do not end up in the film industry. Why cannot television make a contribution to the Film School? That point could be considered because a lot of people who come from there go straight into television and do little in the film industry. I am not criticising the Film School for that, but

talking about the financial backing involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not being critical of the Children's Film Foundation. I mentioned specifically that it does excellent work, but I was critical of the sparse information contained in the report, which is the easiest source of information to hon. Members who find themselves serving on Committees at relatively short notice. There are only five lines in the report devoted to the National Film School. Therefore, it would be helpful if we had a few more details of how the money devoted to the National Film School— which I entirely support—was spent, so that we may have a source of ready information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Durant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I was simply making the point that perhaps television might make more of a contribution to the Film School.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to turn to the disposal of the Eady money, about which there is widespread concern. It comes down to the definition of a "British film", which is difficult. The film industry has had to raise its money, certainly of late, abroad, and particularly from America. Naturally, those who put in the money expect a return on it, but the Minister might consider a way in which the disposal of that money might be used within our country and not returned. That might be a way of dealing with the matter, but we need to look carefully at what the definition of a British film is, as this is one of the difficulties in administrating the Eady levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BFPA, to whom I am consultant, has often spoken to me of its anxiety that the producers—be they independent producers or a member of the British Film Producers Association—do not feel that they are well represented within the film bodies. They have been in correspondence with the Minister on the subject. The commercial end of the deal does not always set out to make films such as the "The Lusty Vicar", but makes imaginative films as well. It certainly does not always feel that its voice is well represented. I make this point for the record. I know that British Film Producers Association has been in touch with the Minister about this and I do not wish to press the point further. I simply want to put on record the association's anxiety about the member-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
ship of those bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only point on which I disagreed with the hon. Member for Keighley was on the question of setting up municipal cinemas. I think that it would be better to implement the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the film industry. The report said that it was wrong to have production, distribution and exhibition all in the same hands. I accept that. In America they cannot all be in the same hands. It would make a considerable difference if we were to adopt a similar view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every time one examines the film industry one ends with a discussion about the distributors. Whether one starts at the bottom, with the exhibitors or with the producers, one ends by discussing the power of the distributors. That power needs to be looked at. The distributors take the risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, one must not be too critical. However I think that they have a rather old-fashioned outlook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the film "Kes", about which I was enthusiastic. He is quite right that it took a lot of pressure to get that seen in the sort of suburban areas that I represent. If there had not been public pressure, that film would never have been seen in those areas. The distributors are a little old-fashioned in their outlook about what people can take. The hon. Gentleman is quite right—namely, that it was because of the Yorkshire voices. No other reason was given. They said that it was a good film, but that no one would understand it down here. What country do they think we are living in?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to re-examine reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and to consider looking at the three elements of the industry to make sure that, as far as possible, they are independent of each other. That in itself will improve the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this order is an interim measure. I hope that we shall be given more information about the disposal of the Eady levy. Let us make sure that the money is spent on British films made in British studios. That is what it is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phillip Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am the last Back Bencer to take part in the debate, it should induce brevity in me. I wish
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
only to reinforce some of the points made by other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) make a comprehensive speech expressing almost all of the worries that many of us feel about the state of the film industry. He made particular reference to the stranglehold of the duopoly of distribution, on the one hand, and the imbalance in receipts for Eady money, on the other. I want to second what he said in those two respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we all accept that this interim measure can allow us no more than a brief opportunity to sound off about some of the consequential problems that have been identified for many years in the Eady distribution. I congratulate my hon. Friend on letting us have a glimpse into the areas into which this money goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone has paid tribute—and I add my own—to the work of the major bodies which are supported by grants from the agencies which have helped to collect this money. Most notable is the National Film School. I may tell the hon. Member for Reading, North (Mr. Durant) that many of the people who are trained at the National Film School initially go to television when they leave there because of the paucity of opportunities in the film industry. If they make their names in television—Mr. John Goldschmidt, as a graduate of the National Film School, is possibly the best example in recent years— they go back into feature films. However, they have to have made a reputation before aynone will give them the opportunity. That is the problem. I do not think that that is the basis of support of the National Film School. The same goes for the BFI and the Children's Film Foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the main difficulty is the problem of distribution. If the distributors are taking the lion's share of this money and continue to maintain and retain their extremely cautious attitude to the independent producer and his product, we are unlikely to achieve an overall improvement in the situation. That is the nature of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It involves more than just the question of the film itself. The film "Kes" has been discussed. It was said that "Kes" could not be shown because the accents of Barnsley were not as easy to understand by the British cinemagoer as were the accent of Santa Barbara. Anything set in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
California is fine, and anything set in Barnsley—or anywhere north of the Trent—is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem which arose for that production company was that it was effectively driven out of business by this attitude which spread across the television and film industry. Kestrel Films had to pick up quickly. The film "Kes", which had been its first flag carrier, was not given proper distribution and all of those talents, which could have been the seeding of tremendous growth of independent productions outside television as well as the film duopoly, did not come about. That is to be regretted. I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to think aloud for a few moments as to how we could do something to see that distributors in future get rather less, or are empowered to act more imaginatively in terms of the films that they show or assist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reading the list of films which received support. I accept that for the short period under review it is impossible to say very much about short films, but it is possible to comment on feature films. I share the concern of the Association of Independent Producers which said in its February newsletter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…it is interesting to note that more than 60 per cent, of the entire Eady payments go to films which are manifestly pornographic. As many of these films have been shown throughout most of the past twelve months, it is fair to assume that the figures are likely to reflect the overall situation, and will certainly call for concern within the industry …"</p></blockquote>
It certainly calls for concern within the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look at the list of low-cost —including "What's Up Nurse", "A Lustful Lady", "Let's Get Laid" and "Sweet Virgin"—I do not see much evidence of merit there. When one considers that many such films were receiving from the levy as much as did major productions listed under the high-cost films, one can see why there is public concern, which is not purely a matter of moral indignation. It is a genuine concern that the element of marriage is not considered at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distribution of those films, and the receipt of levy money made to them, effectively means that there is more incentive to a producer to make the kind of film to which I have just referred than the high-cost films. That cannot be right, and I should like to hear my hon. Friend's comments on that when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>11.14 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for many interesting and highly informed speeches that have been made on this subject. It is rare in Standing Order debates on a Wednesday morning that one has such a lush offering from hon. Members. Many of the key issues have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I was grateful to the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) for his general support for the order. I emphasise that one of the main reasons for the need for this order is the increase in attendances—108 million in 1977 to 130 million in 1978. That is the first increase of any size for a great many years—in fact, for almost 30 years. One has to remember that in 1946 the box office total was 1,000 million seats sold, so there has been a tremendous drop. However, the recent increase is a very welcome sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why we had fixed on a figure of£12 million. There is nothing sacrosanct about£12 million, but our calculation took the present ceiling as£7 million. In today's terms, taking into account the changes in the value of money since that ceiling was fixed, it would be worth£10½ million. If one allows for, say, a 20 per cent, increase in admissions, which we had last year, that would add£2.1 million, and if one assumes the same for the next year—another£2.1 million— that comes out at£14.7 million. So a£12 million figure is reasonably modest and I think that the hon. Gentleman was somewhat unfair to talk about overkill. We thought that that was the best balance between having to come back again over quickly to Parliament and taking the full figure of nearly£15 million, based on the calculation I have given. I should add that the Cinematograph Films Council did not recommend a specific amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman commended the work of the grant-aided foundations. He asked whether there would be increases this year for some of them. It is for the foundations to make their own requests: These are then considered by the Cinematograph Films Council and its recommendations passed to the Secretary of State for his final decision. I have no reason to doubt that the same procedure will be followed this year as has been followed in past years, but I cannot anticipate the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the amounts paid for the script fund of the National Film Development Fund. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
NFFC provides loans to help meet the cost of script writing and other necessary pre-production costs of films. Although the amount paid for the 1978–79 levy year has not been stated in public, I take this opportunity to say that the sum was£200,000, which is a reasonable sum for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I was asked for information on the number of films assisted by the payment of levy. About 132 films were in the first list published: before publication we had no details. It indicates that the number is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the hon. Gentleman asked about specialised industrial documentary films. I agree with him that they are worthy of support. Much of this area already receives support from the BFI, but such films may equally qualify for Eady money, provided that they are British made in accordance with this carefully worded formula and that they are quota films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman indicated that he was pleased that an accountancy inquiry was being carried out and asked whether the inquiry would investigate the profitability of exhibitors—both large groups and the independent exhibitors—and I can assure him that this is a full and thorough investigation which certainly will be looking at profitability and all the make-up and components of that profitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) made an interesting speech which touched on the most sensitive issues. I shall try to give him a full and fair answer. He asked about the expenditure of£574,625 in respect of the Children's Film Foundation. He said that he would like to know more about how this money was spent. That is a fair request. I am not in a position where I can require the BFFA to provide the fuller information for which my hon. Friend asked, but I can request it to do so and I think that it is reasonable, where well over£½ million is spent, albeit not taxpayers' money but trade money, that there is a public entitlement to know. I do not think that there is anything to hide and I am sure that the Children's Film Foundation and the other bodies could helpfully communicate at greater length to the public. I shall certainly pass on my hon. Friend's request and ask the agency to consider it favourably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for what he and my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Whitehead) said about the publication of the data on Eady. It has provided us with information which we need to know if we are to have an intelligent debate on Eady, which is long overdue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend drew attention to what I was going to say about "Hot Wheels ", which is something of a 
	<i>cause célèbre.</i> I think that the final total was about£200,000, because it happned to be exhibited with "Grease". It was never intended that a film of this kind should make such large sums compared with other films which the majority of the public would consider were of much greater weight and merit. We must take that into consideration in future, and we shall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the distributors very often, particularly in respect of the smaller indpendent producers, require their Eady entitlement to be traded in at the outset so that distribution rights are accorded to their film. I accept that his point needs examination. It is indeed being examined by the Interim Action Committee sub-committee on exhibition and distribution, which I hope will soon report on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree that Eady was designed to assist indigenous British film production. I think that the hon. Member for Reading, North (Mr. Durant) also made that point, and I was glad that he did, for reasons which I shall give in a moment. All too often the money goes abroad, even if perhaps later it comes back, although none of us can be sure about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to the definition of "a British film". As he knows, this is carefully formulated in such a way as to be consistent with a very high level of American investment and there can be two views about that, which are well known. There are advantages if one gets another£25 million investment from the Americans. There are considerable disadvantages if they withdraw investment for their own commercial and industrial reasons, as they did in the early 1970s. That is now affected by our EEC membership and the quota involves EEC as well as specifically British films.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend recommended that there should be support for films of special artistic merit and that they should perhaps get an Eady supplement. As I said in my opening remarks, over the last two years we have been carrying out a very careful review of our general film policies, and 
	<i>I</i> hope that in the near future we shall be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
making a major statement on this subject. I assure him that this is one of the matters which we are taking into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the oligopolistic position of Rank and EMI. Clearly this matter is of serious concern. I must speak carefully here. It is a matter which the Office of Fair Trading carefully monitors, and it is for that office to make recommendations, no doubt in consultation with us, about any referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It is primarily a matter for the OFT. I agree that there is a need to examine the position of independent exhibitors. As I have already said, the IAC sub-committee is looking into this matter and we have been examining it in our own review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend suggested that there was a case for exemption from Eady for cinemas concerned with films of distinct and high quality. This, again is a matter to be considered in conjunction with the future of Eady. We shall not conclude our review of this subject before we make our own statement, and this is one of the matters we need to consider. We do not want to limit the value of Eady primarily to British producers and we have to consider the effect of providing exemptions either for films or for cinemas as a whole. Screen on the Hill and other cinemas are devoted specifically to films of high quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked whether we would publish the accountants' report. The industry was assured that all information that it gave to the accountants would be in confidence, even for the Department. I have no reason to doubt that the sponsors —the KRA, the CEA, the IAC—and my Department would agree to the publication of a general finding after it had been discussed with myself and the Secretary of State. Subject to those qualifications, I should be in favour of publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sympathetic to the comments made by the hon. Member for Reading, North regarding the need for donations. I hope that notice will be taken of his remarks. Many producers coming out of the National Film School work in television, but the training costs, in terms of their own disbursements, could be taken into account. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) that paucity of opportunity in the British film industry leads to such results. Nevertheless, it would be helpful if the television companies increased their support for the NFS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the need for Eady to support the British film industry. One way would be to introduce a voucher system, as in France, whereby money would be deposited in the United Kingdom, being drawn only for the making of a new film which met British filmmaking requirements. The matter has been put to the CFC. But the CFC, representing all sections of the film industry, was not entirely in accord. However, there is merit in the suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Reading, North may take it that the BFPA is not happy with its representation on various agencies, especially the NFFC. We will take into account the need to provide ballot representation on the NFFC. Echoing what the hon. Gentleman said, the NFFC is concerned with the British film-making industry. The trade papers have questioned the BFPA regarding its over extensive dependence on finance from major companies in the United States. I do not say that eradicates it right to proper representation, but it is taken into account. However, we are concerned with the British film industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Durant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the BFPA, the reason for its considerable dependence on American money is that our taxation laws which make it difficult to raise capital for films. There is also a shortage of risk capital in this country. It does not set out to attract American money, but it has to survive somehow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn too much on this issue. I doubt the nonavailability of finance. There is considerable finance available in the City. Non-American foreign finance could be yoked to the British film industry if it were seem to have possibilities of yield outside the transatlantic straitjacket into which, regrettably, much of the industry has fallen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point made by the hon. Gentleman concerned the proposal that distribution exhibitions should be split. He mentioned that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission drew attention to the fact that this had happened in America. It take note of that point. It is one of the points which we have taken into account in looking at the position of the distributors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Derby, North rightly spelt out the inhibitions which have been placed on the British film-making industry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
by transatlantic finance requirements. He asked: how can the distributors adopt a less cautious policy? I was asked to think aloud. My hon. Friend knows that Ministers are unwilling to do that, particularly when a policy statement of policy is about to be produced. But the NFFC has certainly looked into this issue and has put forward proposals for setting up its own marketing arm, which I feel is highly relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley asked about municipal theatres. There is already a network of regional film theatres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most relevant consideration into which we have looked and which has been much discussed in the industry in the last year or two is the basis for disbursement of money by the NFFC and the question of assimilating the aid which it gives to that which is now given by the Arts Council to other branches of the arts. There is also the question of how films differ from the other arts. I am not suggesting that they are the same, but it is not self-evidence that they are entirely different. Therefore, what should be the balance between the commercial considerations, which we have pursued up until now, and the artistic or cultural basis for disbursements of money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The last point made by my hon. Friend concerned the support for "soft porn" which Eady appears to give. We have seen the figures. My reaction to those figures is the same as that of my hon. Friend. They are of concern, and I do not think that they are publicly acceptable. It was never intended that the money should be used in this way. I stress that this is in no sense a Government subsidy. Some people have protested in a slightly shrill way and suggested that there is a Government subsidy for pornography. That is not the case. This is an agreed diversion by the industry of its own money. I do not think that it is in accordance with what the industry and the public want. This is a matter which we must reform in our review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered all the points that have been raised. I am pleased that the film industry generates such close and informed interest, and I hope that that will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
