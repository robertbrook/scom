	<p>
	<i>Report and Third Reading</i></p>

	<p>2.—(1) The proceedings on consideration and Third Reading of the Bill shall be completed in one allotted day and shall be brought to a conclusion at midnight on that day; and for the purposes of Standing Order No. 80 (Business Committee) this Order shall be taken to allot to the proceedings on Consideration such part of that day as the Resolution of the Business Committee may determine.</p>

	<p>(2)The Business Committee shall report to the House its Resolution as to the proceedings on Consideration of the Bill, and as to the allocation of time between those proceedings and proceedings on Third Reading, not later than the fourth day on which the House sits after the day on which the Chairman of the Standing Committee reports the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p>(3)The Resolutions in any report made under Standing Order No. 80 may be varied by a further Report so made, whether or not within the time specified in sub-paragraph (2) above, and whether or not the Resolutions have been agreed to by the House.</p>

	<p>(2) No Motion shall be made in the Standing Committee relating to the sitting of the Committee except by a member of the Government, and the Chairman shall permit a brief explanatory statement from the Member who makes, and from a Member who opposes, the Motion, and shall then put the Question thereon.</p>

	<p>(3) If an allotted day is one to which a Motion for the adjournment of the House under Standing Order No. 20 stands over from an earlier day, paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 14 (Exempted business) shall apply to the proceedings on the Bill for a period of time equal to the duration of the proceedings upon that Motion.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Private business</i></p>

	<ol>

	<li>that Motion shall stand over until the conclusion of any proceedings on the Bill which, under this Order or a resolution of the Business Committee, are to be brought to a conclusion at or before that time;</li>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. Some weeks ago, I read out a letter that had been sent to me. As the address was in Bearsden, I thought that it was a letter from a constituent of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw certain allegations that he made about me in relation to Mrs. Lamont, bearing in mind Mrs. Lamont's letter yesterday in the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald,</i> which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sir, I am the parent of a handicapped child who attends a special school. I was distressed to read of the Labour Party's campaign to try to overturn the decision to allow special schools to become self-governing if this were to the benefit of the children. I resent the implication that parents of handicapped children are less responsible and less able to make decisions affecting the lives of their children than parents of 'normal' children."</p></blockquote>
In view of opposition Members' criticisms of me for drawing attention to the letter, it is clear that the letter is genuine, that Mrs. Lamont feels deeply about the issue and that those allegations about me in raising her case were without foundation. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his allegations in the light of the letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 48 is the first in a series of clauses dealing with the future of further education in Scotland. Amendment No. 203 is a probing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1223</span>
amendment which seeks debate on the timing of the inception of college councils in further education. The Bill says that from 1 April 1990 the education authorities "shall", not "may", have the whole question of college councils resolved and established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to know why that date was chosen. Clearly it coincides with the start of the financial year in Government, which must be one consideration. However, in view of the complexities facing some education authorities in setting up their college councils, we should consider a later date for starting. I do not think that there are any political considerations behind that view, because much of the content of clauses 48 to 60 has been part of a consultative process between the Scottish Office, interested parties and the education authority. That discussion is now finding expression in legislation. When the Minister replies to amendment No. 203, we shall want him to tell us why that date was selected and whether there were any further considerations, apart from it being financially convenient for local authority budgeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall dwell briefly on one reason why we are concerned about the complexity of setting up college councils. We shall discuss the composition of the college councils under the next set of amendments. In 1990 the regional councils go for election. It would be a pity if the final stages of establishing the college councils were caught up in the four or five weeks preceding the regional council elections in May 1990. The college councils will be established by a set of councillors and controlling administrations before 1990 which may be changed by the result of the elections. I do not expect that there would be major changes, and some people may argue that that has no real consequence for the establishing of college councils generally. But it will create a period of uncertainty when an important step for the future of further education provision is being taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a variety of concerns, and we would like the Minister to dwell on them and possibly establish why 1 April was regarded as the most appropriate date for the inception of college councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a spirit of reasonableness and co-operation with Opposition Members, I rise to urge my hon. Friend the Minister to accept the amendment. The effect of accepting it would be that college councils would be set up immediately the Bill becomes law, instead of the delay until 1990 for which the Bill at present provides. The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has made a positive contribution in putting that possibility before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one practical reason why the amendment should be accepted—and I assure Opposition Members that I am not, in this context, criticising Strathclyde region. I shall simply read a short section from an article by Mr. Neil Munro in 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</i> last Friday about the subject of clause 48—further education. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Strathclyde Region will not tighten its selection procedures for further education colleges, but it will continue with its controversial monitoring of student SCE and GCE exam results and extend it to HNC and HND students.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1224</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The region's education committee this week heard strong criticisms of the negative emphasis on colleges' performances: a survey of exam results… showed that, of the 12,006 students enrolled for SCE and GCE courses in 16 out of Strathclyde's 20 colleges in 1987–88,41 per cent dropped out and only 26 per cent, of those that remained passed all their exams."</p></blockquote>
I make no judgment on that report and I certainly do not necessarily accept any implied criticism of Strathclyde that the article carries. My point in the context of the amendment is that that sort of criticism surely is a justification for college councils being set up sooner rather than later. If such criticisms are being made, let us set up the new system and get on with it. For that practical reason, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider accepting amendment No. 203.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ten years ago this very morning on 4 May 1979, I was first elected to this House so I am celebrating my 10th anniversary. It is a privilege to be serving on the Committee considering the Self-governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how Opposition Members will take this in view of some of their comments last night but, at the risk of being attacked, I shall ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider accepting amendment No. 203. Opposition Members will now doubtless seek leave to withdraw the amendment. I do not wish to comment on Opposition speeches so far. I have simply done my duty, as I have for the past 10 years, and have looked at the Bill, at the amendment paper and at the selection list. I understand what the amendment does. I have crossed out the words and read the clause as it would read if the amendment were accepted and have concluded that it is a very good amendment. I know that is a facile and stupid thing to do—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) accused me of being that yesterday. In the absence of a Labour party health warning about the amendments reading "Danger: if the Minister accepts this amendment it will damage the Bill", asking the Minister not to take it seriously, I strongly urge my hon. Friend to accept the amendment. Part II will not come into operation until such time as the Secretary of State specifies. Clause 70(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Part II … shall come into force on such date as the Secretary of State may by order appoint."</p></blockquote>
If the amendment is accepted, and provided that we are given an assurance that part II will come into force as soon as possible, there is a possibility of bringing the provisions of clause 48 into effect as quickly as possible. For the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) outlined, that is a good idea.

I do not know what my hon. Friend or Opposition Members will make of my support for the amendment. As I said, we had the extraordinary spectacle yesterday of the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman putting it on record that if the hon.

As far as I can see, there is no asterisk saying that it is a dangerous amendment which they do not want the Minister to take seriously. I ask him to take it seriously nevertheless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to take part in the debate, but as Conservative Members are now talking about timing I felt that it was necessary to issue a health warning. The Secretary of State for Scotland does not even know what day of the week it is. He thought that yesterday was today. Perhaps he thinks that today is yesterday. However, he does have responsibility for running Scotland. That same ignorance of the day of the week and time of year has been displayed by the hon. Members for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), who said that if the amendment were carried it would allow the Secretary of State to implement college councils immediately. If the amendment was accepted clause 48 would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every education authority shall establish a body, to be known as a 'college council', for each such college in their area for the purpose of exercising such functions as may be delegated to it by that authority by a delegation scheme made under section SO of this Act."</p></blockquote>
But under clause 50 the delegation scheme cannot come into operation until 1 October. Far from college councils being up and running immediately, they cannot be up and running until 1 October when the delegation of functions by the education authority takes place. That is an important distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to comment on the period of dual power. I know that there was a period of dual power between the Soviets and the Duma in 1917 in the Soviet Union, or Russia, as it was called at the time. Perhaps the Minister has visions of the college councils becoming a new kind of soviet in Scotland. Opposition Members would welcome greatly the establishment of Soviets, even by a Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would continue to operate as the college council during the period of dual power? I assume that it would be the existing college council. Councils established up to 1 October 1990 will have no role other than to get their membership together and work out how they will implement the powers given to them after 1 October 1990. I assume that if the amendment is passed, nothing will be done in any event until that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Will the Minister consider leaving it to the discretion of education authorities as to when it is best to establish the college councils? There will be considerations, which my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) has mentioned, such as the regional council elections, which could lead to a change in the membership of people appointed to college councils. Surely it is better, if the college councils are to be up and running, that the membership initially appointed consists of people
	<span class='label label-info column'>1226</span>
who are elected as members of the authority, not people who used to be elected members, but lost their seats in regional council elections. That is a serious consideration, and I hope that the Minister will ensure that the college councils get off to the best possible start by having members who were originally on the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for Soviets extends to enthusiasm for financial delegation to schools, which is official Soviet policy, as the Educational Institute of Scotland discovered on its visit to the Soviet Union. That policy has not been adopted by the EIS, judging by the events in Strathclyde reported in the newspapers this morning. I am sure that you would call me to order, Mr. Martin, if I went very far down this road, but I could not resist drawing the hon. Gentleman's attention to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State not knowing the day of the week, I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not comment on the views expressed in that document by the EIS, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and others, which were very critical of the hon. Gentleman and the conduct of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) was keen that I should accept the amendment. With his usual perspicacity, he discovered that the amendment does not do what Opposition Members thought that it would do. It would enable the college councils to be established before the period proposed. It is important that there is time for the regulations to be prepared and for the colleges to take the necessary planning into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) moved this as a probing amendment to establish why we have settled on 1 April 1990. It is quite clean we want the new-style college councils to be up and running as quickly as possible. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Fife, Central said, it should not cause any great difficulties for the education authorities, which are already used to college councils. We are simply changing their composition and making them more representative of the users of the services of the colleges, rather than the producers of the services. It will not be difficult for the college councils to be reconstituted by 1 April 1990. I give an assurance that we shall make the regulations required under clause 48 in good time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) pointed out the importance of getting the colleges up and running, and mentioned the Strathclyde report. I agree that it is important, as further education colleges are big business. They spend more than £200 million a year providing services for almost 200,000 students. They must be better managed in the interests of students and employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Strathclyde report, "Education in the Community", to which my hon. Friend referred, demonstrated the clear need for schools and colleges to have much more control over their own affairs. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1227</span>
showed that two fifths of students involved in SCE and GCE courses in further education colleges dropped out without completing their courses, and barely a quarter of all students passed their exams. We also know that some 30 per cent, of those who start SCOTVEC modules do not complete all of them successfully. FE colleges must be allowed to improve their performance, and part II will provide for that. The amendment would not be helpful by allowing improvements to be made too precipitately or by allowing them to be delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our proposals, college councils will be more representative of college users than of the bureaucracy and teachers. As users, they will demand a much higher performance from their colleges and ensure that colleges with high dropout and failure rates are improved and that their resources are better spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said that he did not wish to criticise Strathclyde. I am pleased that Strathclyde is now taking steps to monitor its colleges' performance, but it is all too late. The Bill will ensure that, in future, taxpayers' money is used more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked why there is an interregnum between 1 April and 1 October. It is helpful to establish a target date, as it gives authorities a goal to aim at and prevents the reforms from being lost in a bureaucratic maze. It also helps the colleges by giving them notice of the timescale within which the changeover will take place, 1 April being the target date. Clause 50 provides for the new college councils to take over their functions on 1 October. The gap will allow college councils to operate in shadow form for some months while they prepare for their new duties. The shadow councils can be involved from the start in considering their 1991–92 budgets. I cannot believe that the Opposition want college councils to be appointed so late that they can be bounced by their parent authorities into accepting their 1991–92 budgets on the run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to the regional elections. Those will take place in May and the colleges in their reconstituted form will be operating by 1 April. I see no difficulty with that timetable. My hon. Friends must contain their enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not necessary. The hon. Member for Fife, Central may not have tabled it with a health warning, but he moved it to probe our thinking on the matter, and I hope that he found the ensuing debate useful in explaining the two dates. I hope that it will not be necessary for you, Mr. Martin, to call a short adjournment and that my hon. Friends will be content to allow the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was in no way useful. We have become accustomed to practical questions being responded to in the narrow, blinkered, ideological way of users and producers— everything in black and white. If one is not for, one must be against. Clearly, the Minister's response was just another extention of that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1228</span>
This was a probing amendment. Logistical problems will arise, but we do not wish to encroach on the next set of amendments, which are based on that problem. College councils in Scotland are currently set up on a basis that is entirely different from that envisaged by the Minister, and some work extremely well. Although reference has been made to Strathclyde this morning, the area that I represent in Fife could have been mentioned, too. The four college councils there are efficient, excellently run and trying always to improve themselves in the market place and in terms of the changing demand for skills. There is a patchwork of different provision throughout Scotland and I understand the Minister's desire to have some consistency in how colleges function, deliver services and are accountable to producers and users. The question was worth raising because some authorities might need longer time than the Bill gives them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is riddled with centralism. Everything in it can be changed or established by regulation. As we have pointed out already, it is one of the most centralising measures, not just in education, but in many areas of activity in Scotland since the war. We are not surprised that the Minister can do almost what he wants when he wants on this issue. The amendment was a probing one and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on the previous amendment we mentioned the composition of the college council. These amendments deal with that. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) will speak to amendments Nos. 128 and 129, so I shall not discuss the percentages to which they refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments aim to establish a better balance in each college council. The Minister and the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) mentioned some colleges. Further education is a major success story in Scottish education. It has weaknesses, but also many strengths. We are worried that subsection (5) in particular will mean that the current balance, harmony and sensitivity about delivering services could be badly disrupted by a composition that might suit the Government's requirements in pursuing enterprise and putting employers in the front line, such as they are doing with Scottish Enterprise. But many college councils work well with different types of composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would put some flexibility into the composition so that each area will have its best interests reflected on the college councils. It is not proper, efficient or productive to take the highly ideological view that employers, who play a valuable and significant role, should automatically, regardless of the practical consequences, form the majority or at least 50 per cent, of any body, whether that be the two thirds involved in Scottish Enterprise or the 10 out of 20 that the subsection specifies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of a college depends on partnership. It is well known that Scotland has excellent employers and industrialists and some dynamic people who make an enormous contribution, not just in their plants and factories, but in the wider community. Our major worry is that the balance of the composition is entirely wrong. We could argue that the proportion should not be 10, but five or six, but that is immaterial. The main issues involve balance, partnership and flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments also deal with the crucial question of what constitutes an employer organisation. Some areas have chambers of commerce, some have residual aspects of the CBI, others have groups such as the Institute of Directors and, further to the Right, some areas have what I should call odds and sods, which might or might not reflect employers' interests. There is a hard core of employer organisations which can be consulted, but the position is patchy. My area does not have a local chamber of commerce but is served by one a few miles away, which has different interests and characteristics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion of employer organisations must be widened. This crucial amendment suggests the inclusion of individual employers in addition to employer organisations. There is an analogy with Scottish Enterprise. It is believed that between initiatives emerging locally and those emerging from the Scottish Office, there will be a trawl of excellent people who could do a good job on a college council. Why does the Bill insist that members of the college council are to be nominated by employer
	<span class='label label-info column'>1230</span>
organisations? We want to widen the employer base to include individuals and industries that are not part of an employer organisation. It is characteristic of Scotland that not every employer—whether in commerce, retail or manufacturing—is part of an employer organisation. It would be a pity if people with commitment, skills and interest were excluded from the process as the result of a narrow definition of employer organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned about what the Minister, in black and white terms, calls users and producers. It is right that employers should be involved as they are major buyers of services, but in an average local authority area the largest employer is probably the local authority or the public sector. In Fife, 52 per cent, of employees work in the public sector in the Civil Service or local government. Rosyth dockyard used to be part of the public sector. A great area of employer-based commitment and contribution must be tapped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly curious about the hon. Gentleman's argument. The term "employer organisation" does not exclude the public sector; the only exclusions relate to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has cleared up one point and caused confusion about another. He will no doubt define employer organisations in relation to subsection (5)(a)(ii) and (iii), and we hope that he will allay our concern. However, the purposeful rejection of local authority employees will exclude a substantial chunk of the working population in a particular travel-to-work area or an area served by a further education college. I am developing not a line of argument, but a series of self-contained anxieties about the narrow definition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman. Clause 48(4)(a) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The members of a college council shall, subject to subsection (5)… be appointed by the education authority after consultation with such organisations, including employer and trade union, industrial or other organizations… as appear to them"—</p></blockquote>
not to the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be representative of interests relevant to the work of the college".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may wish to intervene again, but we must examine the consistency between subsection (4) and the prescription included in subsection (5)(a) which contains firm numbers. Subsection (5)(a) states that 20 shall be the maximum number on the college council and that at least 10 of them shall be from employers' organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman is asking how employers' organisations will be defined. Clause 48(4Xa) provides that the decision as to who is
	<br><blockquote><p>"representative of interests relevant to the work of the college"</p></blockquote>
is taken by the members of the college council themselves. The hon. Gentleman asks me to give a definition, but the Bill provides that that is determined, as it should be, at local level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is either shabby drafting or the Minister has got it wrong. Why does subsection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1231</span>
(5)(a)(ii) not state that there will be some representation from trade union or industrial organisations? There is a jump between subsection (4)(a) and (b) and subsection (5)(a)(ii) which states that 50 per cent, of the members on the college council—or 10 people—will be from employers' organisations. However, if the Minister clarifies the position and says that subsection (5)(a)(ii) does not mean just employers' organisations, that will be fine. The college council will be made up of 20 people. One will be the ex officio principal and 10 will come from employers' organisations. I assume that that does not include trade unionists and representatives of other industrial organisations, but that it refers to organisations such as the CBI, chambers of commerce and the Institute of Directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5)(a)(iii) provides that not more than one fifth of the members of the council shall be from local authorities. That will eliminate the involvement of elected representatives and employees from the local authorities. Therefore, not more than four members will come from local authorities. They, together with the principal and the 10 representatives from employers' organisations will make up 15 members of the council. Therefore, only five places will be available to representatives from trade unions, industrial organisations, voluntary bodies, careers offices and from the students and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any area, many individuals and organisations will be concerned about the quality of skills, enterprise technology and other aspects of education. Some flexibility should be in the clause so that the council can dip into those groups of people should it so wish. The composition of the council as stated in subsection (5) will not be acceptable in its present form, unless the Minister clarifies its provisions further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assumption implicit in the subsection is that employers are the best people to buy in services and contribute to their development. I accept that key industrialists, with imagination and creativity, have a contribution to make. However, my experience on the area boards of the Manpower Services Commission and of 10 years sitting on college councils suggests that the poorest contribution to their work often comes from employers' representatives. The representatives do not reflect the best of the business community. They are often people who have been put out to grass and who have no role left to play in their companies. They are put on the councils to occupy their time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the local authority representatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is not black and white. Some employers' groups make an excellent contribution. In others it is pitiful. Therefore, to pack every college council with 50 per cent, of its representatives from employers' organisations is inefficient, unproductive and unenterprising. That is why the education authority, perhaps aided and abetted by Scottish Office regulations, can have a better balance of college councillors who will reflect the best interests of the college and will provide a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1232</span>
proper skill base of which all employees can take advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is one statistic that should provide impetus for the Government to take a sane look at the composition of college councils, it is to be found in the latest labour force survey, which showed that only eight out of every 100 employees in Scotland received any training in the four weeks before the survey was carried out. So there is a crucial need for good training, but it can be provided only if colleges have people who genuinely represent the best aspects of training in high technology and traditional industries and, more importantly, have some flair for college development, staffing and the sensitivity and partnership that is so urgently needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments throw up permutations, but the essential aim is flexibility. Employers should not dominate the college council and some allowance should be given to regional councils and their education authorities and to islands authorities to examine their areas and, in partnership, select the best so that the college council can be dynamic and enterprising as well as being accountable and representative. I move the amendment on that basis, but I exclude from my remarks amendments Nos. 128 and 129, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Moray.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) as his predecessor, Mr. Willie Hamilton, is today standing for election to my local county council. We welcome Willie Hamilton to our midst because we are broad-minded people in Lincolnshire and we want a meeting of minds between our two nations, although whether Mr. Hamilton will win is doubtful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a meeting of minds between the hon. Member for Fife, Central and myself in figuring out what the colleges should be. That is our starting point. We want the colleges to be in the economic front line and to be flexible, responsible and up-to-date with the latest thinking in local industry. We both agree that those are desirable aims, but then we start to diverge. To understand my thinking, the hon. Member for Fife, Central must look at the history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The colleges were set up under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Circular 929 issued by the Scottish Education Department on 22 April 1975 recommended that the powers of college boards should be increased to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"responsibility for the general direction of the college… close cooperation between the authority and local industry… development of the corporate life".</p></blockquote>
I suspect that many of those objectives are what my hon. Friend the Minister hopes to achieve, so there was nothing wrong in what the circular proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the report of the committee of the Council for Tertiary Education, published in September 1981—I presume that this is not a political view but a coherent and objective view—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the committee's view—based on visits to colleges run by regional and island councils and on written comments received— that most education authorities devolve few functions and little or no responsibility to their college councils, which frequently perform a purely advisory role. Consequently their standing is not high, attendance by councillors and sometimes by members of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1233</span>
industry and commerce is poor, and there is a danger of them becoming merely a forum for staff grievances."</p></blockquote>
That was not a Minister speaking, it was the committee of the Council for Tertiary Education and it is a damning indictment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee believe there is a range of decisions which for all kinds of colleges are most appropriately taken at college level… there needs to be a body at college level to whom the managers of the college are responsible for the satisfactory progress of students and for the efficient use of resources. Such a body might also provide a focus for policy-making within the college."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that it wants college councils to have financial responsibilities and all the things for which circular 929 called during the last Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We probably agree on what we want colleges to be; we want them to be in the economic front line and in touch. But the evidence suggests that college councils are not living up to our expectations. That is the reason for this legislation. Section 125 of the 1973 Act clearly needs to be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not clear where the speech of the hon. Member for Fife, Central was taking him. He does not like employers being given a majority on the councils. I can understand that from his point of view, but what does he want? In his speech he knocked employers and implied that the people who want to serve on this body would not be up to anything else. He said little of substance. Given the history of these bodies, and given that they are not living up to expectations and that they are becoming merely a forum for grievances, what structure does he want?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a broad rule of thumb it is reasonable for the Bill to require local employers to have a dominant voice. The colleges are supposed to be eminently practical; they are not just academic institutions and ivory towers. "Local employers" means all employers, including those in the public service as well as those in commerce and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central did not have the courage to say—or perhaps he is too politically astute—that he wants the current cosy set-up to continue. He does not want employers to have a dominant voice, but more than that he is worried about the decline in the influence of education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities must have a voice, but whatever their value, since 1973 they have not delivered the goods. They have had plenty of opportunity. We have not moved fast; we have given them the chance, and they have read the circulars and the reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In rising to speak to amendments Nos. 128, 129 and 130, I am sorry to disappoint the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman clearly wishes Scottish further education colleges to be in the economic front line and employers to have a dominant voice. My amendments seek to strike a more balanced approach to the development of further education in Scotland. The hon. Gentleman echoed the Minister's words when he said that college councillors should be more representative of users as opposed to producers of education. Many people in Scotland who read reports of the Committee will find "producers" a strange

	<span class='label label-info column'>1235</span>
word to apply to people who provide education services. It takes us back to looking at education merely as a sausage machine for vocational purposes. I had hoped that developments over the past 20 years meant that education provided a wider training for life, not simply guidance on how to earn a living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Lady assume that the term "producers" implies that the product is of no interest or value? Why does she take the example of the sausage machine? Surely people involved in education are producers of a vital product, and the vast majority do that job very well. Why does the hon. Lady consider the term "producers" inappropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly respond because the Conservative party uses such terminology in a restricted sense, meaning that education is solely for training people for a specific role in life. But most Opposition Members believe that education is part of producing the democratic intellect to which the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) referred last night on the Floor of the House. Further education colleges have the responsibility to provide a breadth of education that is not simply related to vocational training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just before being returned to the House in 1987,1 worked closely with two further education colleges in Strathclyde region. One was Langside college, which has a high reputation for the large number of youngsters who undertake O-grade and Higher grade education in order to achieve a university of further education college entrance qualification, and for all the other work that it undertakes in many areas. I also worked closely with Clydebank college, which has its own department for youngsters with special needs. That is one of my hobby horses on the Committee. It is an effective department, giving facilities for youngsters to broaden their education after they have left school at 16. Many people would benefit from a visit to the college to see the work undertaken there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to the work of Moray college in Elgin. It is in the heart of my constituency, and my own further education college. All three colleges work closely with the employers and the local community to take account of what is happening in the outside world, but that does not mean that they are dominated. If the clause is unamended, I fear that dominance by employers will restrict college curriculums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) referred to consultation processes on further education. Various people outwith the House with a direct interest in further education have commented on that. The Church of Scotland states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Instead of a majority being from employer-organisations, there should be a more even balance between members from the community, from education authorities and other educational and training agencies and bodies and from employer organisations."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Employers should be included. Employer attitudes towards further education colleges are substantially
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
conditioned by local needs, so they can help young people to be properly equipped to do jobs in that area. I was a part-time lecturer at Mathew Boulton college in Birmingham, in Newcastle and at the College for the Distributive Trades in London. As a substantial employer, I believed it essential to know what was happening at the college. I also believed that I had the day-to-day experience to make the right assessment and help the young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have read my amendments. I am not trying to deny employers the opportunity to be involved in the colleges. I am suggesting that a third of the members of the college council should represent those interests. That is important, as most young people go into the community where the college is based for their employment once they have completed the course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady would like a third of the membership of the college council to represent those interests. Will she explain how, in a college council of 20 people, with a third being six and two thirds, her amendment could be put into practice? That creates fractions of members. I do not know whether there is a mathematical way of stating a part-time involvement. I should be fascinated to know how she sees that working in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My arithmetical abilities may be as defective as those of the Secretary of State for Scotland on the question of days. Subsection (5) includes the principal of the college as an ex-officio member, which brings the total to 21, as he would presumably be included with those representing staff and student interests at the college. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It would be helpful if the Minister were not distracted by noises from other parts of the Committee. To return—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady slides off on that, 20 is a maximum. Even taking her point— which is slightly dubious—about the 21, if the council decides to have 19, even with the extra, there would still be the problem of the six and two thirds. Is it not the case that she has not really thought it through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is trying in a roundabout way to say that the amendment is in some way technically deficient, perhaps he will respond with a better idea. But he will note that, unlike the Government, I have included a minimum number of 15 for the college council, which he will be happy to know divides by three. That may solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having left our O-grade arithmetic competition behind us, I return to the comments that have been made by various organisations on clause 48. The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such powers are unprecedented and can remove the Local Authority completely from any managing responsibility."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped, in its briefing to myself and to the Committee, said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further Education Colleges play a valuable role in providing continuing education for people over school age with special needs. SSMH is concerned that the increasing commercial orientation of Further Education Colleges could lead to a downgrading of this role."</p></blockquote>
It recommends that there should be a representative with special responsibilities in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Directors of Education in Scotland considers
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the valuable link between secondary schools and the further education sector will be weakened unless provision is made for appropriate representation on college councils."</p></blockquote>
In my amendments, I have tried—perhaps not arithmetically correctly—to ensure that there is a balance among the various groupings that have a particular interest in how education at our further education colleges is conducted. It is important that there is a substantial representation for the staff and the student body. The staff body at any college has the responsibility for the preparation of courses and for the teaching and assessment of those courses. Therefore, the staff should be involved in discussion about the management of their college—as should the student body, because the students are the people who undertake the courses and will benefit from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second group of my amendments suggests that there should be representatives from the regional authority, because regional authorities were, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, given the responsibility for strategic and economic planning for the region. Therefore, they should be involved. They are, of course, also the authorities that are involved with the local secondary schools from which body the majority of the students will come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also suggested that careers officers should be represented. That is a small but effective organisation in Scotland, where skilled men and women undertake to discuss in detail with youngsters the opportunities that lie ahead of them. Since the Government are happy to put out advertisements about square pegs and round holes and so on on television, it seems to me that the careers officers play a vital part, particularly in further education. We should ensure that their expertise is involved and offered to the further education colleges in the management of their committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also suggested that the local voluntary agencies should be included. In my work at Langside and Clydebank colleges, a variety of organisations were involved in our courses, including Dr. Barnardo's, the National Children's Home, the Scottish Society for the Mentally Handicapped, the Scottish Council for Spastics and so on. Many of them are employers in the caring sector of society and they seek opportunities for education for their clients so that they, too, can have the opportunities that are accorded to everyone else. So those organisations should all be included in my proposition for the college councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the employes' organisation has a role and should be involved. I am not attempting to deny employers their right to be involved in the college council, but only in a fair and balanced way and taking account of all those other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
Finally, with reference to employers and their representation on the committees, one of the comments that I picked up on the news this morning, when there was so much discussion about anniversaries, was that, 10 years into this Administration, only one in 40 managers are women. Many women attend colleges of further education, but there is a danger that the employers will not ensure adequate representation of women on the college councils. I worked on a joint management committee, to which I shall refer in a later amendment. It always seemed that many of the women were doing the teaching work and much of the hard graft involved in producing the courses, but they were severely under-represented at management levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister taken into account, in the composition of college councils, the emphasis that will be given to the role of women in deciding the policies of further education colleges? The amendments that I have tabled attempt to achieve a fair balance for college councils. It is obvious that the Minister will not accept them as they stand, but I hope that he will take on board the basic principles that I have advocated. We should not hand over the college councils to one major dominant group in society, but we should try to achieve a balance of all those who are involved in and who care about our post-school education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 243, which is in my name, is much more limited than those tabled by Opposition Members. I hope that it will gain the support of Opposition Members as well as that of my hon. Friend the Minister because it gives the education authority more flexibility than the present formula. I was a little puzzled by the criticism that the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) made of my hon. Friend the Minister for his reference to "producers". Teachers are producers of education services, although that description may not be a correct analysis of Mr. Gray's view of EIS officials in Strathclyde. I do not know whether an educated ostrich is a productive species, although I hasten to add that Mr. Gray was not criticising teachers generally, simply their representatives. No doubt the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) will be happy to associate himself with those comments later in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education colleges clearly have a vocational emphasis, although they are not purely vocational. It makes a lot of sense to have strong representation from employers, to ensure that the colleges provide the skills that will be needed and used productively in the local economy. I should point out to the hon. Member for Fife, Central that the term "employers' organisations" includes organisations for individual industries, such as the building industry, which has its own Scottish employers' organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education authorities may wish to appoint representatives of schools or of other further education colleges to a further education college council, to maintain links between different colleges and between colleges and secondary schools, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
school leavers go to college and some pupils attend colleges part-time for national certificate courses. The Headteachers Association of Scotland is interested in the possibility of secondary school representation on the college councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the formula in the Bill, school staff or staff of other education authority establishments, such as other colleges, rank as education authority employees. They could be appointed only if the education authority gave up one of its places. It would have four places in a council with a maximum size of 40. Amendment No. 243 would allow the staff of other colleges or local education establishments to be appointed from the "others" block—the block of about six out of a 20-member council. That seems to give the education authority limited but desirable flexibility to ensure an appropriate level of cross-representation on a college council from other related institutions, such as secondary schools and other colleges of further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendment of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). It is easy for us to support the principle that employees of other education establishments should be exempted from the one fifth limit placed on local authority representatives on councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak as briefly as I can. Amendments Nos. 215 and 216 would allow not only persons nominated by employer organisations but other individual employers to be part of the block of up to 10 representatives appointed to the college council. I support those amendments because in my constituency, in particular, they would introduce some welcome flexibility. An insistence on nominees of employer organisations would limit the choice available to the local auhority. To include individual employers in the process of consultation and nomination to the council would be wise. I hope that that will be fairly common ground and that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 263 would secure an explicit place for trade union representatives in the block of 10. Trade unions should be explicitly recognised in subsection (5). I fail to see why employer organisations should be given special status by being picked out of the range of organisations to be consulted, which includes trade unions and industrial organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will rise above his ideological distaste for the role of trade unions in society, and at least acknowledge that they have a valuable role to play. The Government should recognise the role of trade unions in the Bill and not just leave local authorities to recognise it within the remaining block that they can fill. If local authorities fill four out of a maximum of 20 places and employer organisations fill 10, there would be only six places left, including that of the principal. If the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) were accepted, one or two of the remaining five places could be filled by staff representatives from other educational establishments. In that case, the role for trade unions on the councils becomes very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, at least, there are no grounds for limiting the role that trade unions can play. It would be an ideological imposition on a situation which the Minister may imagine exists in other areas—I do not believe that it does—where trade unions manipulate and use college councils to further their own ideological ends. On the contrary, trade unions on the councils will be committed to developing colleges in such a way as to enable students to become as well equipped as possible for the world of work. That would be the only motivation for trade union representatives on the councils. We hope that that would also be the motivation of the employer representatives. It is not necessary, sensible or right to introduce a distinction between employer organisations and trade union representatives in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will show some willingness to introduce trade union representation on college councils. To see the issue in black and white is not in keeping with reality in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, employer organisations are often the most lacking in their contributions to further education colleges. Therefore, it would be wrong to boost their role artificially when they are not even capable of mounting an effective contribution now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to amendment No. 265, it is not clear what subsection (5)(b) means. Will the Minister explain whether the "further conditions" that may be prescribed
	<br><blockquote><p>"as to the composition of the council"</p></blockquote>
will require legislation, such as regulations or statutory instruments, or can the Secretary of State prescribe those conditions by fiat? It would be an unhealthy provision, which would make senseless our whole debate on the balances of forces on the college councils, if the Secretary of State could change the conditions by fiat, without reference to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are debating further education colleges and the powers of the Secretary of State, will the Minister confirm that the stories that have appeared in today's newspapers about the Government's withdrawal from the Lingua programme, which aims to improve modern language teaching in schools, will not have an impact on similar college and university programmes to which the Government have already agreed? The Lingua programme is supposed to generate exchanges of pupils and teachers between British and European schools. It appears that the Prime Minister does not like the idea of British schoolchildren being exposed to European languages. We hope that that is not the first fruit of the No Turning Back group's pamphlet against Europe. It is certainly a Stone Age attitude as 1992 approaches. As he has responsibility for colleges, I hope that the Minister will confirm that the college and university exchanged programmes that have already been agreed between the United Kingdom and European Governments will not be prevented by the Prime Minister's prehistoric attitude towards Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) who referred to the report by the Committee of the Council for Tertiary Education in Scotland, which was presented to the Secretary of State in September 1981. While considering this clause, the Committee should bear in mind the points made in that report. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to bring into the colleges men and women who are concerned with local industry and with local affairs generally and to harness their talents and experience to ensuring that the college is as well run as it possible can be."</p></blockquote>
That makes the case for the provision whereby not less than half the members on the college council are to be nominated by employer organisations. The quotation is evidence of the importance that should be attached to the voice of industry and commerce. Schools wish to become involved with local industry so that as producers—I do not flinch from using that word—they are in harmony with the requirements of employers who will be the source of job opportunities for those whom they are teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to respond to the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) and speak to amendment No. 216. Like my hon. Friend the Minister, I also find it an attractive amendment unless it is an Opposition conspiracy to ensure that a local authority will be empowered to appoint to college councils placemen, reliable men from local industry. In that case, there might be cause for concern, but there is much in the amendment to be commended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles said that employer organisations were not very active in his constituency. I am sure that that also applies to other constituencies. Heaven forbid that the only sources from which members of college councils are to be drawn are nominees of organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry. I am not sure that the CBI is always the best body to further the cause of enterprise. From the remarks that it has sent to me, I am not convinced that it is the best judge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I must point out to my hon. Friend the Minister that there may be thrusting entrepreneurs— 
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> These days, entrepreneurs are thrusting only on the 10th anniversary. Those two words should be harnessed together.

Thrusting entrepreneurs may be interested in helping on college councils, but they may not be in favour with their employer organisation or they may not be members of an employer organisation. They may own small businesses that are not affiliated to an employer organisation, although that is unlikely. We should not allow the clause to be too limiting, as it is now, in confining itself to employer organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to be persuaded by my hon. Friend the Minister, but in the true spirit that the Committee has enjoyed, despite remarks in the press to the contrary, my observations are made in a spirit of inquiry and I hope that my hon. Friend can respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This time, the Government clearly got it wrong. Even the Conservative Back Benchers are beginning to realise that; the penny has dropped. Perhaps the penny will drop with the Minister, so that he changes his mind. The clause is seriously flawed and could lead to the problems that the hon. Gentleman described unless the civil servants come up with an escape clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the speech made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) and particularly in the double act that he and his hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) indulged in. It was like an Abbott and Costello act on the thoughts of Charlie Gray and whether members of the Educational Institute of Scotland were ostrich-like. That is exactly the sort of contribution that the educational forum has criticised: members of the Committee refuse to speak to the substance of the debate and indulge instead in petty political points against individuals in either party. But I shall deal with substantive parts of the clause and what it means to further education colleges; I only wish that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle had done the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is a fair man. I spoke for 10 minutes on the substance of the clause. I gave my view on the history and I mentioned Acts of Parliament, circulars and committee reports. I mentioned Mr. Charles Gray for about 25 seconds in a 10-minute speech, so I will have no more of that sort of nonsense from the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were said that Mr. Charles Gray was mentioned for only 25 seconds in the Committee's proceedings, no one would believe it. He has been mentioned in almost every debate that we have had. Conservative Members mention him at every opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that he mentioned circular 929; indeed, he went as far as to say that there was nothing wrong with it. He said that he had studied it closely and that he agreed entirely with its contents. So he must agree with the circular in its comments on the representation of education committee members on college councils. It says that the greater the delegation of powers, the greater should be the representation of education committee members. It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In no case should such representation exceed one-third of the total membership of the college council."</p></blockquote>
No doubt the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle will support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who suggests that one third of the membership should come from representatives of education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

attention to the part of circular 929 that emphasised the need to develop
	<br><blockquote><p>"close co-operation between the authority and local industry in furthering the aims of the college".</p></blockquote>
The circular is only advisory, but its hopes have not been realised. That is why primary legislation is now necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is backtracking from his earlier statements that there was nothing wrong with circular 929. Now he suggests that there is something wrong with it because he had read only the one part of it that he tried to use in the debate. That is why he was found out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman used a phrase from the consultation paper as if it were his own. He is an author of Right-wing pamphlets such as "Save Our Schools". Perhaps he steals from Government consultation papers, or perhaps it is the other way round and the Government's consultation papers steal from his books and pamphlets. The 1987 consultation paper says that each college should be seen to be in the economic front line—as the hon. Gentleman suggested—standing shoulder to shoulder with local employers in the battle to improve competitiveness. Nobody would disagree with that, but it does not tie up with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 48(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The members of a college council shall, subject to subsection (5) below, be appointed by the education authority after consultation with such organisations, including employer and trade union, industrial or other organisations"—</p></blockquote>
there is no mention of individual employers—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appear to them to be representative of interests relevant to the work of the college."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that the decision will be left to college councils, so he must not have read that subsection, which states that the decision will be made not by college councils, but by education authorities after consultation with organisations, including employer organisations. The subsection says specifically that consultation will be made with such organisations
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appear to them to be representative".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recall what I said, but if I said that the decisions would be taken by the colleges, I was wrong. The members could not decide because they would not have been appointed. If I said that it was a slip. The Bill is clear about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is clear, and that is why some Conservative Members are worried about it. Education authorities will not be given the freedom to decide. They must consult organisations. Subsection (5)(a)(ii) specifies:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not less than half the members are selected from persons nominated by employer organisations."</p></blockquote>
The Bill is very clear; if one is not a member of the CBI, the chamber of commerce, or the Institute of Directors, one will probably not be consulted or appointed by the education authority, whose hands are tied by the legislation. The Minister must come to terms with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
The Bill will exclude major employers in the area, such as the regional and district councils. The two largest employers in Dundee are Tayside regional council and Dundee district council. No other employer comes anywhere near to employing the number of people in Dundee that those bodies do. Yet, anyone who happens to belong to the local chamber of commerce will get much greater representation than the two largest employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The largest employers in industry—such as Michelin and The National Cash Register in Dundee—are not necessarily members of local organisations, so they will not be consulted or appointed. That is a serious flaw in the clause and if the Minister does not understand that, he should read the clause more carefully and come up with an explanation of its drafting, which seems to betray a complete ignorance of the realities of local employers who are interested in FE colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will cover individual employers. Major employers in Dundee would be interested in the training provided by a further education college. If the education authority felt that employers should be represented on the college council, there should be no bar on that. However, as clause 48 stands, such a bar exists. Its structure is wrong. Ten members of the council will be representatives of employers' organisations such as the CBI and the chambers of commerce. In addition, there will be the principal and four representatives from the education authority. That leaves just five places for a host of bodies. They include trade unions, voluntary organisations, health boards, careers officers, organisations for the disabled, economic development agencies, enterprise agencies set up by Scottish Enterprise and training agencies. They will have to squabble among themselves for the five remaining places on the college council. That is not right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray proposed a formula based on one third representation. Our formula would be that two fifths of the representatives should come from employers' organisations and trade unions, and one fifth should come from the students and staff. That would leave another two fifths of the places to be allocated to the other groups. That might not be perfect, but it is better than the Minister's proposals. I hope that, like the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth), the Minister will say, "Heaven forbid" to employers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
being cut off from having a say on college councils discussing the provision of training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the difference in wording between the Bill and the notes on clauses. In the Bill, clause 48(5)(a)(iii) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not more than one fifth of the members appointed by the authority are members or employees (other than persons employed at the college) of either that authority or of any other local authority".</p></blockquote>
However, the notes on clause 48(5) state of subparagraph (iii) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"more than one-fifth of the members are elected or employees… of any local authority"</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not more than one fifth"</p></blockquote>
and the notes on clauses state: "more than one-fifth". Will the Minister tell us which is correct? The Bill and the notes on clauses are contradictory. The Minister should not present the Committee with such documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that there has been a typographical error in the notes on clauses and that a "not" is missing. The Bill is correct. Notes on clauses are issued for the convenience and assistance of the Committee and they have no other status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be convenient for Committee members if the notes on clauses were accurate. In this case, they are not and could be interpreted differently from the Bill. Subsection (5)(a)(iii) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not more than one fifth of the members appointed by the authority are members or employees (other than persons employed at the college) of either that authority or of any other local authority".</p></blockquote>
That means that staff working at the college are exempted from those provisions. There is no block on them becoming members of the college council. At least, that is how I interpret subsection (5)(a)(iii). The hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) proposed that the word "college" be substituted by "any educational establishment". That would put no limit on the number of people from education institutions serving on the council. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood shows another flaw in the Bill. Subsection (5) is constructed shabbily. It is open to all sorts of interpretation. Perhaps nine members from education establishments could be serving on the council although the Minister's intention was that it should be just four.

The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle said that FE colleges had not delivered the goods. He has not read the Government's consultation paper which states:

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman vindicates the remark of my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) in the Chamber last night. He said that he "went" to school and other people were "educated" at school. Of course there is a "but"; more can always be done. But that document clearly contradicts the point of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle that education authorities have not delivered the goods. They have delivered the goods even though more could be done. I assume that the Minister was in office when the consultation paper was issued and that he accepts that FE colleges have delivered the goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that FE colleges are big business because they spend £200 million a year, and he started to knock them in the same way as he knocked education authority schools. If a takeover is intended, the first thing to do is to attack the object of that takeover to undermine confidence in it. In the debates on clauses 1 to 47 education authority schools were consistently attacked. Now attacks are being made on FE colleges without foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides the groundwork for the day when the Minister can do what he has always wanted to do and take FE colleges away from education authorities. The Minister is quoted in a newspaper as saying that he looks forward to the day when FE colleges can be freed from the restrictions of education authorities. That is what the clause is really about. Let us be honest and not have such hogwash from Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>But more can be done. We need to ensure that from the top down each college is permeated with an attitude of mind which rewards initiative and innovation. The Government believes that the potential of the staff in colleges has not yet been fully tapped. Each college should be seen to be in the economic front line, standing shoulder to shoulder with local employers, in the battle to improve competitiveness—and therefore job opportunities. And it is not enough for a college to be responsive in a passive way to the needs of its students and employers; it must become a focus for local training initiatives, stimulating innovation enterprise and employment in a proactive rather than reactice way."</p></blockquote>
That is the true context in which we should judge what has been done and what needs to be done

in the future. The basic theme of the consultation document was that Government initiatives in the past were based on exhortation and not legislation and that not enough action was taken. The Bill deals with the problems acknowledged by successive Governments. The ideals in the clause were set out under a Labour Government by the Scottish Education Department in its circular 929 of 22 April 1975. The legislation seeks to bring into effect those proposals.

I shall support amendment No. 216 if Labour Members do not mind Conservative Members voting for it or the Minister giving it serious consideration, but not if it is one of those amendments where Labour Members say, "Oh my God, I hope the Government do not accept this amendment."

I agree that it would be wrong to allow employer organisations to nominate employers. As today is the 10th anniversary of Thatcherism, we should be well aware that Thatcherism is against corporatism and stands for individualism above all else.

In small towns there is often one significant employer of labour. That is true in my constituency and in others. In Immingham, South Humberside Fabrications Ltd. was set up by one man about 15 years ago. He was an ordinary shop floor worker, a fabricator; today, he runs a successful business employing about 200 people. He is a major employer and I doubt whether he has ever had much time for the CBI, the chamber of commerce or any other such organisations. He is the sort of person who should be on college councils in Scotland because he employs 16, 17 and 18-year-olds.

My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) mentioned the consultation paper "Proposals for improving the management of further education colleges" issued in August 1987. That admits the role that further education colleges have played in the economy, and their good work in recent

years. However, it fails to recognise the extent to which they are already in the economic front line— as the consultation paper mentions—and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with local employers and other bodies in promoting employment in their areas.

Several hon. Members have pointed out that many employers are not members of organisations. That is particularly so in rural areas. Therefore, many employers will not be represented. That is true in my constituency, where 60 per cent, of employment is in the public sector and 80 per cent, of other employment is in small businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Many of those firms will not be involved, so the opportunity for them to play a part in colleges will be denied to them.

Strathclyde regional council has been mentioned several times in debate. We have the advantage of experience, which Back-Bench Members from English constituencies—who make judgments from press releases—do not.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Colleges have been encouraged to be proactive in identifying and meeting training needs in their localities and abroad. Strathclyde regional council
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
has been involved in wider areas, for example, in pickup—the Professional Industrial and Commercial Updating scheme—the West of Scotland Regional Technology Centre, which is part of the United Kingdom network, and the Strathclyde training enterprise network, which provides training for small businesses in partnership with the Scottish enterprise foundation based in Stirling university, in the Minister's constituency. It has also been involved in the West of Scotland University Enterprise Training Partnership with Europe, and in allowing overseas students access to higher education. Strathclyde regional council's work could be impaired if the Minister does not pay sufficient attention to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the proposed size and composition of the college councils, Strathclyde regional council does not seek a dominant voice in college councils. Only three members of the education committee are on college councils in Glasgow at present. Industry is well represented on the councils, with the Glasgow chamber of commerce in collaboration with other local chambers, and the STUC each nominating three executives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where will those colleges find the employers to sit on their councils? A similar question was raised when we examined the White Paper on enterprise and training. The Government have received submissions from the Scottish Council for Development and Industry and other agencies that there are insufficient business men to man the networks of employment agencies, never mind the college councils, which require at least 10 business men each. The Minister should listen to those voices before making it mandatory to have at least 10 representatives from businesses on Scottish councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> there was a report of the PA Consultancy, which was sent to the Scottish Office. It is worried about the number of business men available to fill the posts in the various quangos. For example, it pointed out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"some 85 per cent, of Scottish managers… have no formal business or management qualifications and 86 per cent, regard training in advanced manufacturing technologies as unimportant, in spite of the growing shortage of skilled labour."</p></blockquote>
About 85 per cent, of managers consider that training is unimportant, yet the Government, through some ideological commitment, are putting individuals on to college councils without considering the problem that currently exists in Scotland. The PA Consultancy report also says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are not enough businessmen of talent and drive available to give the time required and that the government's plans"—</p></blockquote>
for the enterprise training scheme—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would create a chaotic structure."</p></blockquote>
If they would result in a chaotic structure for the enterprise programme, they would also result in a chaotic structure for the college councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I ask local business men in my area whether they will sit on college councils, they will say that their prime duty is to run their business, make profits and be in their plant every day. The Government want to ask them to devalue their role in their businesses and to take on the concerns and affairs of other business. By all means have local businesses and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
employers on college councils. But surely from a pragmatic point of view the Government should look again at the numbers that they have prescribed to be on those councils. The major problem with attendance is that these representatives will be extremely busy. The education service and the college councils are already interacting in a variety of ways with local businesses and employers, for example with SCOTVEC, in the development of courses, in staff exchanges, and in arranging work placements for pupils and students. That work is already going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should define the category of business men and employees that he wants to be included here. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East suggested that enterprise trusts should be considered and that community businesses, trade unions and other economic initiatives should be incorporated into the college. Finally, the Minister should consider raising the maximum number on the college councils to 25. That would leave scope for co-option from other institutions including schools and bodies interested in adult and continuing education and in programmes for students with special needs where the colleges already make worthwhile contributions. Colleges are already doing good work: the present system should be built on, not destroyed. I hope that the Minister will consider our amendments seriously so that future college councils can be worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I must thank my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) for bringing up the 1975 circular. I looked at it during our discussion and was surprised that a circular put out by a Labour Government should state under the heading "College Council":
	<br><blockquote><p>"A criticism of some existing boards of management is that they have not been delegated sufficient powers by education authorities to make them an effective instrument of management. The functions of college councils should therefore be clearly defined and the councils should be entrusted with the maximum powers consistent with the education authority's ultimate responsibility."</p></blockquote>
So Mr. Charles Gray was obviously thinking about that 15 years ago, never mind five years ago. It was much part of the Labour Government's commitment, certainly on paper, to have college councils with substantial powers which played a management role. The pity is that local authorities ignored that circular and did not provide for those powers, which is why the Bill is necessary. I am surprised that what was considered right in 1975 is controversial today. The difference between that Labour Government circular and the Bill is that the Bill will deliver the expectations rather than simply indulge in rhetoric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of interesting amendments have been tabled and we have had a wide-ranging and interesting debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes could not have been entirely serious when he suggested that he would vote for the amendment because it was advanced sensibly by the Opposition, although one never knows with him. I listened carefully to his arguments and I shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
I shall try to deal with the amendments in sequence and bring some order to the debate because some of them conflict with each other. It is likely that college councils will be at or above the 15-member minimum which is set by amendment No. 128. I do not see why a college council could not be set up with fewer than 15 members if that was appropriate. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) spent most of his speech telling us how no employer representatives were available but concluded that the college councils should be made even larger. I do not know how he squares that. Even if he reduces the proportion of employer representatives, if he increases the size of the council the absolute numbers will rise. No doubt he will now explain exactly what he was proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My idea in asking for the number to be increased to 25 was to allow for a more representative involvement in the college councils by community businesses, trade unions and other groups. It was to counter the Minister's ideological stance. We are simply increasing the number of employers by 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously accepts that that would not deal with the supply problem which he says exists and which I certainly do not believe exists. We have 49 further education colleges in Scotland. If he is telling me that it is not possible to find 500 people in the whole of Scotland with the necessary expertise, experience and commitment to their community, he is going to be in for something of a surprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is so confident that there will be 10 people from business organisations to staff all the college councils, why is he saying that it is important to concede that we can have college councils which have fewer than the 15 minimum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To allow for the flexibility that may be appropriate—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman should know by now, after more than 120 hours of debate in this Committee, that Conservative Members do not wish legislation to lay down hard and fast rules which will not allow for flexibility on the ground. I began my remarks by saying that I accept that the majority of college councils will have more than 15 members, but I see no reason why I should accept amendment No. 128 which would require them to have at least 15. It is inconsistent with the arguments that have been put by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the concern of the hon. Member for Dumbarton and others about why employers should have the largest say on the college council, the reasons are clear. They are the ultimate consumers of vocational education and training. They will be able to provide directly the expertise and knowledge that colleges need to fine-tune their vocational courses to the local labour market needs. As members of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
Committee will have noted, clauses 55 to 57 provided for college councils to undertake commercial activities and to set up companies to run them. That is a new area, and again, councils will wish to have direct access to practical commercial advice. Therefore, I do not believe that the proportion of employers on the college council should be reduced to one third, as proposed in amendment No. 129, or the proposed two fifths in amendment No. 262.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect "employer" to be interpreted widely, to include public sector as well as private sector employers. We have heard many speeches from Opposition Members pointing out the dominance of the local authorities as employers in their areas. If I may say so, one of the problems in Scotland is that the local authorities have large numbers of employees who have to be paid for on the backs of the private sector, which limits growth and the opportunity for investment. This measure is designed to try to create the skills, abilities and enterprise in communities which will change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of "employer" will be interpreted widely. It will include public sector as well as private sector employers; representatives of professional associations may also be appropriate if the college provides professional courses. There is no intention that employers' representatives be drawn from a narrow clique. Indeed, the authority is obliged by the Bill to cover the range of interests relevent to the college's work. Conversely, there is no bar to authorities appointing other interests, such as trade unions, under the other blocks on the council.

Labour Members have started to listen now that I am talking about trade unionists. When I was talking about employers, there was a hubbub and total disinterest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true; ears prick up. The trade union plea was the plea that came from the Opposition. Trade unions have a different perspective on training from employers and they would be the first assert so. I cannot agree that employers and trade unions should be combined as proposed in amendment No. 263. They are different groups and they should be treated as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about trade unions, my hon. Friend the Minister should confirm whether he is working hand in glove with Mr. Charles Gray, which the EIS alleged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be more prepared to accept the accusation that I was working hand in glove with Charles Gray because "hand in hand" implies a different relationship. To be fair, my hon. Friend should read the complete quotation from the report in 
	<i>The Scotsman.</i> It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regional officials of the Educational Institute of Scotland yesterday said that Strathclyde's leader, Charles Gray, appeared to be working hand-in-hand with Michael Forsyth, the Scottish education minister, to introduce ideas that would undermine the Scottish education system."</p></blockquote>
Neither the great Councillor Charles Gray nor I intend to undermine the Scottish education system.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
It will be interesting to see who runs Strathclyde—Charles Gray or the EIS—and whether his policies will be implemented. His policies on technology academies were not accepted and the rug was pulled from under him by trade unions and others.

With regard to amendment No. 215, I appreciate that authorities may wish to consult individual employers on appointments to a particular college council. If those employers are particularly large customers of the college, however, they can do so anyway on a voluntary basis. Amendment No. 215 would make it compulsory to consult all individual employers with an interest relevant to a college's work. For a large college, or one dealing with many small businesses, that could mean 50, 100 or more. Multiplied across Strathclyde's 20 colleges, it would be a very heavy, unnecessary burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) argued cogently that I should accept amendment No. 216, which would make it possible to appoint representatives of individual employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that amendment No. 215 would require education authorities to consult every employer in an area. That is nonsense. It seeks to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or such other employer or employers"</p></blockquote>
before the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as appear to them to be representative of interests relevant to the work of the college".</p></blockquote>
The authorities decide who to consult, so they could consult large employers but omit small employers. The Minister has not read the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It includes all individual employers with an interest relevant to the college's work—

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) should know better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether employers have an interest is a matter of fact, not a matter for them to decide. Characteristically, the hon. Gentleman intervened to cause a dispute as I was about to agree to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 216 is defective, but I agree that the hon. Member for Western Isles and my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes have a point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And our hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they have a point and, on this 10th anniversary, it would be appropriate to accept the spirit of an amendment which seeks to highlight the importance of the individual as opposed to the corporate employer. I undertake to table an amendment on Report to reflect the nature of amendment No. 216.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 130, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), seems to be intended to increase the local authority's share of the college council to one third, which is above the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
proportion of many existing councils. This measure is designed to free colleges from local authority control, so it would be perverse to increase that control. If an authority reserves two places from the one third for a voluntary agency and a careers officer, the number of local authority representatives under amendment No. 130 would be reduced to roughly the number permitted under the existing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 129 and 130, taken together, are technically defective as, if the size of the council was not exactly divisible by three, there would be a problem. The hon. Lady's difficulties with arithmetic remind me that in the guillotine motion, there has been no provision for handing in examination papers and I have received no examination papers to date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have any plans to correct such papers if he finds out the answers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The inspectorate has been working on the matter and we have a set of answers. I await the papers and a bottle of whisky awaits the member of the Committee who submits a script.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled by some of the specific bodies mentioned in amendment No. 130. If by, "college management", senior college staff is meant, the college principal is already an ex officio member of the council. Voluntary agencies may have a direct interest in the work of some colleges, but surely not all. Similarly, careers officers can advise on career opportunities for students, as can employer members, and some college councils will already have in-house advice from their own careers officers. Some authorities will doubtless wish to appoint district council representatives, but it seems wrong to apply a blanket requirement to all colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 130, which refers to subsection (5)(a)(iii), and amendment No. 264, I can give an assurance on the representation of college staff and students. We expect that, as at present, college staff and students would be represented on all college councils. If that did not happen my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State would use his powers under clause 48(5)(b) to make regulations requiring the appointment of staff and student representatives. That, of course, assumes that the Secretary of State has power under clause 48(5)(b), but that is precisely the power that would be removed by amendment No. 265, which is tabled by the very people who are trying to get more representation for college staff and students under amendment No. 264. There seems to be an inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members want everything to be spelt out in the Bill rather than in regulations, by what feat of crystal ball-gazing can they predict any difficulty that might arise in future over the composition of college councils? Of course, they cannot predict the unexpected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 243,1 accept the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart)
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
that there is a good case for schools being represented on college councils in view of their close links with colleges. I also agree that it will be easier for authorities to achieve that if schools' representatives can be appointed from the "others" block, rather than from the authority's own representation. Therefore, I am happy to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on amendment No. 217, I give an assurance that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities will be consulted, together with other relevant representative bodies, in any review of the regulations affecting the composition of college councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot accept most of the amendments in the group, I can accept amendment No. 243 and shall bring forward an equivalent to amendment No. 216 on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even by the Minister's standards, that was a dreadful response to straightforward concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 215, the Minister is receiving the wrong advice, or he is confused about the need to consult every employer in an area such as Fife, which has about 8,000 employers. That was a simple, straightforward amendment to extend consultation and allow individual employers to be consulted if the education authority believed their interest to be relevant to the work of the college. The Minister obscured the issue and did not respond in any technical sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alas, we shall withdraw the amendment, but hope that the Minister seeks further clarification of that point and that some of those issues will be taken on board to ensure that the composition of the college councils will be more representative than the Bill currently provides. With those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
