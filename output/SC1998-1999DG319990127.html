	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Department (Mr. Paul Boateng)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Codes of Practice No. 5) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
What a pleasure it is to meet this afternoon under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton—a feeling that I am sure is shared by all my hon. Friends—to consider an important matter that relates to the policing of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is perhaps no more important power available to the police in the exercise of their functions than the power to stop and search an individual in the circumstances prescribed by law. Because of its importance, and because of the aid that it can give to the police—when it is properly used—in detecting and preventing crime, it is right that the Committee should have the opportunity to reflect on the order. That is not only because it is a police power, which, when properly exercised, is of enormous significance and importance, but because where it is exercised in circumstances that give rise to concern, it can have a very damaging effect on the relationship between the police and the community. The police recognise that fact and have taken steps, over the years, to make sure that that power is properly available to them, and is properly used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members rightly want to ensure that the codes and orders that affect that power can be supported. We believe that the time is right to update code A to reflect changes in legislation made by section 8 of the Knives Act 1997, section 25 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and section 13B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. It is also desirable to clarify how searches under stop-and-search powers are to be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to commence section 8 of the Knives Act and section 25 of the Crime and Disorder Act at the same time that the revised code A would, subject to the agreement of the Committee, come into force—that is, on 1 March 1999. Section 13B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 is already in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 8 of the Knives Act amended section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, to allow an inspector to authorise the exercise of stop-and-search powers for up to 24 hours if he or she reasonably believes that incidents involving serious violence may take place, or that people are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons in a specified locality in the police area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Section 25 of the Crime and Disorder Act further amended section 60 of the 1994 Act, to provide a power for a constable to require the removal of, and to seize, items used to conceal identity, within the specified locality for which an authority under section 60 of the 1994 Act has been given. The office exercising the power must reasonably believe that the item is being worn or carried wholly or mainly for the purpose of concealing identity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware of the practice adopted by certain elements, from time to time, of wearing balaclavas to prevent their identity from being determined—for instance, in the course of demonstrations and sit-ins of the sort that are all too often the precursors to disorder and criminality. The concern on the public's part about the carrying of knives is something that Committee members will be aware of from their constituency mailbags. We are all united in our determination to support the police in using the law to bear down on such a dangerous practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 13B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provision) Act 1989 came into effect on 3 April 1996. It allows an officer of the rank of assistant chief constable, where it appears expedient to do so to prevent acts of terrorism, to authorise his officers in a specific area to stop and search pedestrians and anything carried by them for articles that could be used for terrorist purposes. Sadly, it has from time to time been necessary to use that power, but I hope that in the future it will not be necessary to use it with the same frequency. None the less that power is of importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the conduct of searches under stop-and-search powers, code A currently provides that where on reasonable grounds it is necessary to conduct a search that involves more than the removal of an outer coat, jacket or gloves, this shall be done out of public view, for example, in a police van or police station, if there is one nearby. That is to protect the dignity of the individual and all the evidence shows that it reduces the likelihood of intervention either by a crowd that may gather in such circumstances, or by the friends and associates of the person being searched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Code A does not specify the extent of a search that may be conducted in a police van, nor does it specify how searches carried out at a nearby police station are to be conducted. Consequently, there is some uncertainty about the procedures for conducting such searches, and the relationship with the procedures in code C for searching detainees at police stations on detention. The proposed revision to the end of section 3.5 of code A is intended to clarify these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 67 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides that the Secretary of State may revise the whole or any part of a code of practice, and when he does he must prepare and publish a draft code, consider any representations made to him, amend the draft as appropriate and lay it before Parliament for approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A draft revised code A was accordingly published together with a consultation paper in August 1998. The documents were sent to 137 consultees and 15 responses were received. In general, the proposals to update the code
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
to reflect changes in legislation were welcomed, as was the proposal to clarify how searches under stop-and-search powers are to be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the police use their powers is a key test of whether they are delivering their services fairly to all sections of the community. It can have a significant effect on the lives of citizens, on perceptions of the police—not least those of members of the ethnic minority community or by young people—and on the willingness of those communities to co-operate with the police in tackling crime and disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In December, we published a report on the results of the second year of ethnic monitoring of police activity under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Members of the Committee may remember the interest that that, understandably, generated. The report showed, as in the first year, that there were substantial differences between ethnic groups in the use that the police make of their powers to stop and search, arrest or caution suspects. Black people in particular were getting disproportionate attention from the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there are complexities that make interpretation of the data less than straightforward, the figures give cause for concern. I am pleased to see that the Metropolitan police service is tackling the issue and has developed a plan, currently being piloted in five sites in the Met, to manage the use of stop and search fairly and effectively. That focuses on ensuring that managers control the way in which the power is used and that they challenge unfair practices. More generally, the Association of Chief Police Officers is also taking forward work that will lead to the development of good practice guides for forces on the effective use of section 95 monitoring data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are currently awaiting the report of the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence. Getting to grips with the issue of stop and search will be one of the key challenges for the police service as it works to gain the trust and confidence of all sections of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, managing the way in which stop and search is exercised is central to its fair and effective use. That is why we have included a new note for guidance in the draft code, which emphasises the importance of supervising officers considering and addressing evidence that stop-and-search powers are being used in a discriminatory way. Supervising officers are advised to take account of the information on race and the criminal justice system published under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police associations have all welcomed the proposed revisions resulting from changes in legislation. Both the Police Federation and the Police Superintendents Association have warmly welcomed the clarification on the conduct of searches under stop-and-search powers, which will have the effect that searches involving exposure of intimate parts of the body may not take place in the back of a police van, and that such searches involving juveniles will require the presence of an appropriate adult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it heartening that operational police officers themselves consider it right that the conduct of searches under stop-and-search powers should be more tightly
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
regulated. That is for the benefit of the police officer as well as of the citizen who is to be searched. I cannot stress sufficiently how vital it is that our police should feel confident in using the stop-and-search power, which is an important tool in the course of their ordinary duties. We must never arrive at a state in which the police feel reluctant to use that power, as it is designed to enable them to act properly in a way that helps them bear down on crime and criminality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the revisions are made to the code so that the legislative changes can be fully implemented, and that there is clarification of how searches under stop-and-search powers are to be conducted. I hope that the Committee will approve the draft order, which will allow the revised code to come into effect on 1 March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Benton, I associate myself entirely with the Minister's remarks about the great pleasure that it is to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not take issue with the statutory instrument, and hope that the revision will lead to the appropriate use of important stop-and-search powers. The revision is appropriate in the light of three important legislative provisions: section 25 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, section 13B of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, and section 8 of the Knives Act 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree, too, with the general approach of seeking a balance, because, although the stop-and-search power is important for the police, it has to be used sensitively, for the reasons that have been outlined. It is our wish that it be managed appropriately, so as to lead to such sensitive use. We welcome what we have heard about the plans of the Metropolitan police and the guidance that has been put forward by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that use of stop-and-search powers is especially important in the context of the Knives Act, given the widespread use of knives in criminal incidents. I understand from a recent British crime survey that 350,000 incidents involving knives take place each year. That is a frightening statistic, and anything that assists the police in tackling the problem, which affects far too many of our constituents, is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Knives Act had all-party support in the previous Parliament. In section 8 of that Act, stop-and-search powers are carefully circumscribed by location and time, and they also require the authorisation of a senior officer. Clearly, in such a sensitive matter, it is right to consider how the powers are to be used, and how they can be appropriately circumscribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we want reassurance that when the powers come fully into operation, they will be used as effectively as possible. We would welcome from the Minister some indication that the Government will keep under review the use of how stop-and-search powers under the Knives Act. We hope that that would ensure that they are used as sensitively as possible, and that this will be an effective provision in the hands of the police, who, we hope, will not be in any way hindered in tackling the serious problems of knives. We trust that it will enable them to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
reduce the number of incidents in which knives are used. No doubt all members of the Committee share that sentiment. Subject to our request for a review, and our stated support for the police, who must deal with these problems, we take no issue on these matters. We hope that revision of the code of conduct will lead to the satisfactory use of this important power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We also are pleased, Mr. Benton, to be considering this important matter under your chairmanship. We all agree that stop and search is an important power. My party has no wish to hinder police operations. However, we have a traditional and, I hope, respectable, concern for civil liberties that the Minister shares and that we can treat seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the main provision. We have been concerned for years about the use of the stop and search power, especially in respect of ethnic minorities. In that context, note 4DA is especially welcome in that it requires supervising officers to examine the figures. We remind the Committee of the scope of these statistics, which show that black citizens are five times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched: there are as many as 1 million incidents a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other key issue on the background to the revision is that the Home Office report revealed substantial differences in the way in which police forces use their powers to stop and search. We hope that, as well as revising the code, the Government will make efforts to ensure that there is more consistency nationally because the figures reveal that, even with a national code in place, we still seem to end up with different forces using the powers in different ways. This causes us concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham (St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the quoted figures for stops and searches depend to a great extent on the integrity of police officers in reporting that they have carried out a search? Many officers do not bother to report that they have stopped and searched x and y on a Friday or a Saturday night. As for race, creed or colour, these are never mentioned unless more senior police officers are actually watching what is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the key element is the recording of what is taking place. Note 4DA requires all officers to record searches, but unless recording and supervision are carried out effectively, we are talking in a void. We hope that this will give supervising officers an additional incentive to ensure that recording takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some specific concerns about the revised code. Sections 1.6A and 1.7AA cover groups and gangs. We can all envisage groups or gangs known to carry knives or to take part in other illegal business. However, individuals such as motor cyclists, for example, who might mistakenly be thought to be hell's angels, may be concerned that they could fall into this category. Rastafarians are clearly identifiable, and a police officer might mistakenly use this to say that they are associated
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
with a particular group or gang that falls within the provision. I merely ask the Minister to ensure mat the group or gang provision is used for specific and targeted groups or gangs rather than being allowed to a fall into a general usage that would allow police officers to justify their actions against a much broader category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Note 1.AA, which relates to Muslim women and the removal of face coverings, obviously deals with a sensitive area. One concern is about whether a face covering, having had to be removed, will be returned. I am pleased that the provision requires privacy, and an officer of the same sex present. This may be a critical element because, although the police will have powers to confiscate the face covering, considerable distress would be caused to a Muslim woman who, having had it removed, was not able to re-cover herself before going from the private area into the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that note 1G gives instructions that when an authorising officer introduces powers on an area-wide basis, the geographical area of an incident must be limited. We shall be interested to find whether monitoring will take place to show whether areas are, typically, being drawn too tight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we have some concern about note 2A, which begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In some circumstances preparatory questioning may be unnecessary".</p></blockquote>
It is hard to envisage circumstances where it would not be necessary. Such questioning is helpful in defending police officers against accusations of illegal detention. We would like to strengthen the requirement to make preparatory questioning obligatory: that would improve stop-and-search powers. However, we welcome note 4DA in the code of practice, which stops such powers being used against specific groups, particularly ethnic minorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Government intend to examine other aspects of police practice? Will they give similar instructions in cases where supervising police officers have regard to the targeting of particular groups? That would certainly be in line with the Commission for Racial Equality's proposals on the broadening of such monitoring. It would also accord with assurances given by the Minister's predecessor, now the current Secretary of State for Wales, who, in a parliamentary answer last year, said that the Government would examine stop-and-search powers and the monitoring of police activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some questions for the Minister which follow on from those of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about the disorder created by the unruly behaviour of gangs. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) said, it appears that police officers do not always keep a record of their searches. In my constituency work, I sometimes deal with law-abiding citizens—or, at least, citizens who have not been charged with an offence—who complain that they have been victimised by the police, who are always stopping them. When I make inquiries, I find that there is no foundation to those allegations, as far as the police are concerned.

The police constables to whom I have spoken may not know what is happening. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South is nodding in agreement. If those officers do not know what is happening, we must examine why that is so. Respect for the law is the result of confidence in the law. Upholders and makers of the law must have integrity if they are to command our respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider this problem? Section 4.1 of die code of practice states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An officer who has carried out a search must make a written record unless it is not practicable to do so, on account of the numbers to be searched or for some other operational reason".</p></blockquote>
The code of practice goes on to specify what must be included in the record, which must be made immediately, or as soon as is practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cannot such a record be made on the police officer's duplicate booklet, and a copy given to the person who has been searched? Those who are stopped for speeding are given a ticket, so why cannot people who are searched receive tickets? It may be argued that that creates an onerous duty for me police, who cannot be expected to carry yet another notebook. However, I believe that such a system would ensure that search reports were made and taken to police stations. That seems to me an eminently good idea. Will the Minister assure me—not necessarily this afternoon—that he will consider it as a way of ensuring that me entire police force approaches this matter with integrity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Before I was elected to Parliament, I practised both as a solicitor and a barrister. In the 1970s, I went to the police station, where I was given my client's confession. It had been written out by me police officer in advance. "No doubt he would agree to this, sir," the officer said. When I said no, they used other methods with my client. The Minister, from his own professional experience, will know what I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served on the Committee that considered the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill. In an exchange between the then Member for Putney, David Mellor, we began to discuss all me things that went wrong. A code of practice was developed. For the first three or four years it was wonderful. Everybody kept to it. Then slippage began. For instance, there is not supposed to be photographic identification—mat is, a witness or victim picking out the villain from among the pictures of 12 faces. It is not meant to happen, but the Court of Appeal let it happen. The only interesting thing about that case—one in which I was involved—was that all the witnesses mentioned dreadlocks and, gosh, the only picture of the 12 that showed someone with dreadlocks was the one of my client. Some of those shown were white, some were Indians, some were Chinese, a couple were
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Afro-Caribbeans—and there was my client, with his lovely dreadlocks. Were we surprised when he was picked out! That was never meant to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code opposed such methods as police officers—of course no one in this Room will ever have heard of such a sinful tale—putting drugs in a van. We know that that happens. Look at what has happened in Notting Hill Gate. The Minister knows all about tins. He has fought the cause as hard as I have over the years in London. The code implied that searches should take place in the presence of me defendant, but the Court of Appeal decided it was not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent case in Northampton, when the man concerned had left the flat,—there was another villain there—die police suddenly found a gun. He was not there to challenge that. The other villain was not going to give evidence in a month of Sundays, because he was not charged. Such incidents are worrying. It is necessary to state in the code, in black and white, that the suspect must be present, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a classic case several years ago in Ipswich, the police picked up my client in a vehicle and said that he had all me tools for a burglary in it. I was fascinated. I managed to persuade the judge in that case, who was quite human, that it was wrong for the van to be searched by police officers in the yard of the police station while my client was in the cell that looked out—through frosted glass— over where the search was done. They would not take him out to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the point of codes that we do not enforce? I agree with every amendment that me Minister has made concerning stop and search. They are very good. It is the first time since the Act mat some positive amendments have been made to it. That may have something to do with the change of Government. I would not know, and of course it would not enter my mind to be biased or have favourites. The original idea of the code was that if it was broken, me evidence would not be admissible. That is a jolly good way to tell police officers to do their job properly—which is not too much to ask.

A friend of mine was driving a posh car. He was smartly dressed and was going to play squash. He had a bag in the back of his car. This was in the leafy suburbs of London. An officer, after stopping him, asked him, "What are you doing in this area?" He answered, "I am going to play squash." the officer asked, "Is that your burglary bag?" and he replied, "No, it is just squash equipment." He was then told, "Get out of the car. We are going to search it." As my friend, who is more than 6 ft tall, emerged from the car, the conversation continued, with me officer, who was about 5 ft nothing, looking up at him. My friend said, "The police national computer will have told you my address. If you go there, you will find my lawnmower still out and, if you like, you could be so kind as to mow my lawn." The officer did not take kindly to that and threatened to arrest him. The officer was then handed a business card stating that the man was a barrister of law, yet he has been stopped many times.

The late Mr. Lawrence's brother was stopped yet again last week. A West Indian friend who is a doctor has been stopped 40 times in the past three weeks. Whenever I drive up the Ml or the M6, I never see white people stopped. I have even seen the police stop someone who was on the inside lane from me—I was overtaking him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that codes are great, but please can we begin to enforce them? If we do not, the contempt felt in the early 1960s for police in the metropolitan district—those of us who were around in those days will remember it well—will re-emerge. What has happened to ethnic minorities in the past few years may be telling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that this does not happen only in London, but in Merseyside and many other areas. The targets may also be different—the Irish in some places, gipsies in others; the genuine gipsies are the Romanies. We cannot allow such discrimination and we must do something about it, which is why I am here to make these remarks. I know that the Minister understands what I am talking about and knows that we must begin to enforce all codes, not just code A. Then we might be able to ensure that people do their jobs properly rather than cut corners. When corners are cut there is a great risk of the wrong man ending up in gaol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and constructive debate. Both sides of the Committee have done what I anticipated when I introduced the order by reflecting on it and sharing their professional or constituency experiences. My hon. Friends the Members for St. Helens, South and for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam all emphasised the importance of getting the balance right, as did the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). The order gets the balance right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be naive—I am anything but, having become hard-bitten by the sort of experience to which my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South referred—to believe that codes by themselves are enough. That is why I am heartened by the significant change in attitude by both the Police Federation and the Police Superintendents Associations in supporting and warmly welcoming the codes. Their members include the superintendents who are frontline senior managers and the federated ranks who are engaged—day-in, day-out—in the difficult and dangerous business of policing our communities. They all recognise the importance for attitude and practice of adopting the philosophy that underpins the codes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Policing can be a dangerous business. I heard what the hon. Member for Hallam said, for instance, about bikers. If he for a moment visualised himself faced with a group of bikers in full leathers—sadly in the past groups of bikers have been associated with carrying weapons, violence and social disorders—he would realise that the snap decisions that a young or lone officer is required to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
make in those circumstances rule out the notion of engaging in an interview or a question and answer session before the act of searching. The codes have to reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When surrounded by a potentially hostile and dangerous group of men, some of whom may be tooled up or tanked up, a police officer's job on the front line is to protect the public by disarming them. One cannot engage in question and answer sessions in those circumstances. The House has a duty to equip me police with the powers, codes and order that enable them to exercise their discretion properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is possible to engage in a question and answer session police officers will do so. Good police officers do not want to incite a violent response and will take the necessary steps to talk someone into a search. However, in certain circumstances, they must have the freedom to do what this code allows them to do, which is to get on with the search and do the difficult and dangerous job of policing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to clarify the question of groups and gangs and the guidance that is going out to police offices; I did not mean that bikers as a whole are a group or a gang. There are specific gangs like hell's angels who are clearly marked out by their colours and are wholly different from a group of motor cyclists going to a rally in Peterborough on a Sunday afternoon. I simply wanted to clarify that the group or gang provision would be carefully monitored and that the tight, rather than the wider definition would be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence in the police's capacity to tell the difference between an innocent group of bikers and a gang of hell's angels because we as sure as hell can, as can our constituents. I have every reason to believe that the police will know the difference, and we will give them the powers to deal with gangs that terrorise the countryside when they come across them. I hear the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What characterises the Committee is that everyone has talked about balance. I have not served on a Committee with my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham for a long time and it is a pleasure to do so. We spent many happy hours on Finance Bills together. I will certainly turn over in my mind his suggestions and I will write to him. I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South, who brings with him a raft of experience as a practising solicitor and barrister, that we are aware of the reality and issues of management. The Metropolitan police are very much aware of it which is why the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis himself has taken a leadership role in changing attitudes and practice in this area. That is reflected up and down the country by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The management role is crucial and we are working to get it right; I believe that we can. I very much welcome the support of both sides of the Committee as expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I certainly give him
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
the assurance that we will keep these matters under review. Indeed, it was precisely such a review that led us to decide that use of these powers could be authorised by someone of inspector rank. We felt that the rules and powers were unnecessarily and unhelpfully restrictive and we wanted the police to have the flexibility of action mat we believe is correct. However, to get the balance right, there will be a requirement to inform a superintendent about the initial authorisation and a superintendent will be required to sanction any extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
It is a question of balance. We believe that we are getting it right. We are glad that both the Police Superintendents Association and the federated ranks support our proposals and we are glad that they have found a welcome on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
