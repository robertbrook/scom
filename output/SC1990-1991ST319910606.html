	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Andrew Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (Mandatory Awards) (Amendment) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote>
Although I have moved the regulations, the Opposition reject them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you, Mr. Leadbitter, for chairing our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition strongly oppose the Governments abolition of student's entitlement to the vacation hardship allowance. We do not object to the other points covered by the regulations; we welcome the extension of the benefits of European Community student status to students from the former East Germany. We do not object to the consequential amendment to the regulations that arises from redesignation of parts of architecture courses as eligible for mandatory awards. The whole saga of grant support for architecture courses was a spectacular and damaging fiasco for the Government. Their position collapsed in the face of the powerful arguments advanced by the Labour party and by the architectural profession, even though the courts dealt the final blow to the Government, forcing a humiliating retreat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition reject the regulation as a whole because they abolish the vacation hardship allowance, which has until now been payable, at the discretion of local education authorities, at a rate of up to£53·50 per week, to students who would otherwise suffer undue hardship during the vacations. The abolition of the payments will deepen the hardship that many students already face as a consequence of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This policy is wrong because it cuts away the last piece of the safety net that has existed for the poorest students, removing from them the protection of social security—which should be available to all citizens. It is wrong because it flies in the face of the advice given in the Social Security Advisory Committee report, which in 1990 examined the ending of students' entitlement to housing benefit, unemployment benefit and income support. It is wrong because the withdrawal of the allowance has been rushed through, during the first year of a previously untried system. It is wrong because the Government withdrew the allowance without consultation, without intimation that they were to do so and without giving any opportunity for comments to be submitted. It is wrong because the alternative sources of support to which Ministers have referred—the access funds—are patently inadequate to meet the needs of the many students who are in financial difficulties. Finally, the policy is wrong because it goes back on ministerial statements, made as recently as July 1990, which stressed the availability of the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We know that the Government make a habit of doing things that they said that they would not do and not doing things that they said they would do. However, in this case we are dealing not with speeches made at the hustings, but with statements made by Ministers on the Floor of the House and in another place. It is a serious matter. I shall give the background. The Social Security Advisory Committee examined the Government's proposal to end students' entitlement to housing benefit, income support and unemployment benefit and presented its report to Parliament in July 1990. It concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>"we believe unanimously that there must he a safety net which ensures that students are not left destitute.</i>Our overriding concern is that the Access Fund arrangements may not prove adequate to enter for the minority of students who find themselves with no means of personal support during the long vacation. If for any reason the Access Fund is not able to make a payment, a small number of students could suffer severe hardship."</p></blockquote>
The report went on to recommend discretionary payments of income support during the summer vacation, to avoid hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the withdrawal of most students' entitlement to social security was debated in the House in July 1990, the Minister for Social Security and Disabled People was pressed on the issue and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Social Security Advisory Committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"said that during the long vacation, some students might be particularly hard hit, and they should have recourse to a safety net. There is already a safety net—the power for local education authorities to pay hardship payments".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 July 1990; Vol. 176, c. 102.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister repeated that on a later date when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of course, a safety net is necessary in these circumstances … As I said earlier in response to an intervention, local education authorities have the discretion to award vacation hardship allowances during the long vacations. Those can be worth more than £50 a week to the student. The costs to the education authority are fully reimbursed. In those circumstances we do not believe that there is a case for retaining a social security safety net".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In those circumstances we do not believe that there is a case for retaining a social security safety net". [
	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 July 1990, Vol.176, c. 1101.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Member clearly implied to the House—I am sure in all sincerity—that, were it not for the vacation hardship allowance, there would be a case for introducing some other safety net, as was urged by the Social Security Advisory Committee. What has change since he made that committment? Nothing, except that the first summer vacation is approaching when students will really need the money and will want to take the Government at their word. Suddenly, the rules are changed, the Government's word is not their bond and the allowance is no more. We need an explanation of the Government's departure from their stated commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as though the Government had devoted much energy to monitoring the previous take-up of the allowance. Recently, I asked the Minister in a written question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How much money has been paid to local education authorities to reimburse them for expenditure on vacation hardship allowances; and how many students have benefited in each of the last five years including the current year to date".</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth), replied.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local education authorities in England and Wales currently have a discretionary power under Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1990 to pay a means-tested allowance … Since 1 April
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
1990, authorities' expediture on mandatory awards has been reimbursed by 100 per cent, grant from my right hon. and learned Friend. Lower rates applied in earlier years.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Authorities' expenditure on the allowance and the number of students in receipt of it from 1986–87 onwards are given in the table. Figures ace not yet available for either 1989–90 or the current year and, in the latter case, are likely to be affected by the improved arrangements for student support"—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 March 1991; Vol.187, c. 516.]</p></blockquote>
A table attached to that answer showed that the number of students in receipt of the allowance varied between 288 in 1986–87 to 305 in 1988–89 with a total value of grant paid of between£36,000 and nearly £41,000 per year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What did the Minister mean when he said in that answer that the figures for the current year were likely to be affected by the improved arrangements for student support? Was he attempting to claim that the new system was so generous to students that even fewer would need to apply for the vacation hardship allowance? If so, is not it an act of even more extraordinary spite to remove the support from the few whom expected would still need it? Or did he mean that the loans plus access funds regime was serving students so badly that there would be a sharp increase in need?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister square either interpretation with the remarks of his ministerial colleague, Baroness Blatch, whose response to the debate on the regulations in another place on 15 May was, I paraphrase, that the Government feared that there would be a deluge of unjustified applications from students working the system? Is that the Government's view or does the Minister take issue with that disgraceful slur from his colleague in another place? We demand a clear explanation of how the Government believe that they can justify such an appalling breach of faith. It is an appalling breach of faith with the students affected, with the Minister for Social Security and Disabled People, who stressed the availability of the allowance, and with the House to whom he made those statements on behalf of the Government. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary owes us a clear explanation of those points. Doubtless we will hear him attempt to claim that the vacation hardship allowance is superfluous. Indeed, he is recorded as saying that the allowance was
	<br><blockquote><p>"no longer needed, now that the resources available to students have been substantially increased, notably with the introduction of loans. Its removal will ease local education authorities' administration of awards."—[
	<i>Official Report</i> 27 March 1991; Vol 1553, c. 414.]</p></blockquote>
That does not square either with the evidence of student hardship as revealed by surveys and my post-bag or with the confusion over the operation of access funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many students are facing considerable financial hardship. Even if we count in the value of the student loan, many students are worse off as a result of the Government's changes in student support, especially because of the withdrawal of housing benefit. I receive letter after letter from students and their parents complaining about their deepening financial difficulties. It is a real struggle for people to study, especially for those from poorer backgrounds. I shall quote from one letter, picked from random, which describes the plight of a student at Loughborough University. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would like to present before you a case study of a typical student with typical working class parents who are proud of their children's achievements and want to help them succeed but have limited funds available to them."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to explain that Loughborough University was chosen
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"partly because of the implicit intention given in the prospectus of 1990 that if the student so wished it would be possible to remain in Halls of Residence for the duration of the course … However, he now finds that thanks to the Government policy to Universities and Polytechnics of 'Cram them in the courses to make more money' the university is unable to honour its promises to most second year students. In a small town like Loughborough this has put considerable 'business' opportunities to those people able to buy up property and because of the demand the students are having to agree to very unagreeable terms, i.e. the average rent being asked is£30 per week per student. The really disturbing fact is that these students are being asked to pay this amount for 52 weeks of the year although they are only there for 30 weeks of the year and the student grants which you will be aware are now falling in real terms each year by the rate of inflation contain an amount equal to£15.50 per week for accommodation for term-time only. At the same time as grants are frozen, Poll tax bills are levied at students, Housing Benefit payments cease and also Income Support ceases which until recently was available in the long summer vacation.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Your response may well be that students have the opportunity to work in the holidays. This is very true but in case it has escaped your notice because of the present economic situation it is not terribly easy to get jobs especially temporary ones just when you need them. My daughter already works one evening a week to try to supplement her grant but after all her main priority whilst at college is to obtain her degree."</p></blockquote>
The correspondent goes on to deal with student loans and writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the country cares enough to have its brightest talents developed why should they have to start off their working life with large debts around their necks. It does seem that this idea discriminates against the less well off parents as parents suffering financial hardship have to witness either seeing their children denied the chance of further education or of carrying a financial burden which makes the whole thing just too unattractive."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has read out a letter describing how hard done by students are in this country. Would he comment on how the United Kingdom system of financial support for students compares with that of other countries notably that of west Germany where, according to the Labour party, the quality of education is better.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am unable to provide a convincing refutation now due to the constraints on our debate, I should be delighted to write to the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter to which I referred, illustrates precisely the difficulty facing many students and their parents, especially those who are from poorer backgrounds. As the correspondent specifically mentioned, the real difficulty arises in the summer vacation, and especially at a time of mounting unemployment when it is not so easy for students to find jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
What is to become of the student whose college's access funds have been exhausted, who cannot find work in the summer vacation and who has no last-resort financial support? It is scandalous that the regulations will remove that last-resort support—the remains of the safety net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it any wonder that students are struggling when the outside-London mandatory award of£2,265 provides support for 38 weeks only. Student loans are meant to provide additional support for the entire year, but it means that, in the vacation, the student in London has a weekly income of£8.50. It is even less for students outside London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of students have lost entitlement to welfare benefits, housing benefit, income support and unemployment benefit, which is critically damaging to them. It is clear that student resources have not increased as Ministers like to claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to Government figures given in
	<i>Hansard</i>of another place on 26 March 1990, total student benefit claims were estimated at£68 million for 1989–90. That illustrates how much has been taken from those students who need it most. No wonder that the recent survey on student financial support conducted by the National Union of Students found that 36 per cent, of student unions found that their average student lost more than£400 in housing benefit during the academic year; 10 per cent, lost between£500 and£600 and 6 per cent, lost more than£700. The survey presented convincing evidence of the acute difficulties that students face. Students find it impossible to survive solely on their grant and student loans in the long vacation, when their financial resources are exhausted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a direct result of Government policy, many students have a weekly income well below the income support level. A student in London in receipt of a mandatory award and a loan from the Student Loans Company Ltd and with a weekly rent of£45 will be left with£18 a week to meet all other expenses. That is£10 below the 1990–91 income support level for 18 to 24-year-olds. It is wrong to expect students to survive on such an income. As a consequence students' studies will be harmed, drop-out rates will increase and opportunities will be lost. That is especially true for those who cannot turn to their parents for extra support. It is outrageous of the Government to take away the safety net of the vacation hardship allowance in such circumstances especially as, with unemployment mounting, the opportunities for vacation work will be so much harder to come by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will claim that the students can look to access funds for support. However, research shows that colleges have not geared access funds towards providing support during summer vacation. By February of this year, 53 per cent, of colleges were distributing their funds on a three-term basis and, of the other 47 per cent., many were allocating funds over a shorter period—usually two terms only—rather than over a longer period that would include the summer vacation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more, guidance issued to colleges by the Department of Education and Science encouraged them to discount the summer vacation in their allocations. Further education colleges have been instructed to return to the Department of Education and Science any access fund money held in excess of the original 15 per cent, allocated by 31 March. The recall date was the end of the financial year, that caused immense problems in providing support during the third term, never mind the summer vacation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The revised guidance from the Department of Education and Science that stated that institutions could, after all, retain money for the third term and the summer was issued at such short notice that it was too late to help them in their planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance to higher education colleges was even more confusing. Originally, institutions were told to return unspent access money to the funding council by 31 July, thus making it impossible to cater for hardship during the summer. Severe disruption was caused in January when the Department of Education and Science announced that any money held in excess of the original 15 per cent, had to be returned by 31 March. That ruling was dropped after representations from college administrators and the National Union of Students. The Department of Education and Science finally stated that unspent money did not have to be returned until 31 August. However, many colleges—not surprisingly, in light of this history of confusion—are still unaware of the new deadline and are working to the original date of 31 July. As a result, college administration procedures do not provide for extra support for students during the long vacation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us remember the scale of the inadequacy of the access funds. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals—CVCP—has pointed out that the Conference of Registrars and Secretaries is reviewing the administration and costs of access funds and assembling information that demonstrates the hopeless inadequacy of the£25 million allocated—it is to be increased by£8 million for next year. It cites the example of one university that calculated that it needed £370,000 to meet reasonable applications from its students against an actual provision of£198,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may claim that access funds are adequate despite evidence to the contrary. Can the Minister say whether they have monitored the adequacy of the funds? The Secretary of State for Social Security responded to the advisory committee's report as follows—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government intend to monitor the operation of the scheme to establish whether the funds are adequate for their purpose."</p></blockquote>
What stage has that monitoring reached? What results has it provided so far?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Access funds cannot and do not provide the last resort safety net which the Social Security Advisory Committee said was essential and which the Government said that they were providing through the vacation hardship allowance. For all the reasons I have given, the allowance must be retained for at the very least, the coming summer which, after all, will be the first summer vacation in which many students will otherwise be left with nowhere to turn for last-resort financial support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government who genuinely cared about education opportunities for the less well-off would not have decided to freeze student grant, having cut its value remorselessly for the past 12 years, and would not have ended entitlement to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The miserable proposal before us is the final confirmation, if any were needed, that the Government could not care less. The Governments decision to abolish the vacation hardship allowance is a thoroughly mean and vindictive step, a product of bad faith and one more Tory barrier in the path of the poorest students. I urge the Committee to reject the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Mr. Alan Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) observed, the amending regulations make three significant changes to the arrangements in England and Wales for mandatory awards for students on full time, first degree and comparable courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first two, affecting some architecture students and students from the former German Democratic Republic, are relatively uncontroversial and welcomed by those affected. I was glad to note that they were also welcomed by the hon. Member for Oxford, East. The hon. Gentleman, however, spoke specifically about the third change: the withdrawal of the vacation hardship allowance. I shall also restrict my remarks to that change as far as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend's speech will not be as long as that from the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) because I am sure that members of the Committee have better things to do. The hon. Gentleman's speech was long because he wanted to make up for the absence of five of his parliamentary colleagues and the Liberal Democrat. Does my hon. Friend agree that they take the matter so seriously that they are absent, elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) had had his way, the speech of the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) would have been three times as long. The hon. Gentleman has made a crafty, audacious but enjoyable parliamentary intervention. However, I agree that we should be brief so that the Chairman can remain completely happy. So, naughty, naughty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I was merely seeking to ensure that your experience in committee was more enjoyable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am thoroughly enjoying it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naughty, as you suggest Mr. Leadbitter, but very perceptive My hon. friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) made a fair point. The absence of the Liberal Democrat spokesman is deplorable and an indication that that party's protestations on behalf of students and their welfare contain a large element of humbug. We, however, are concerned about students, which is why our Benches are so well attended. We regret the absence of participation from the rest of the Labour party. The hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) looks a little forlorn and isolated. Therefore, he made a very long speech, which was observed by the Committee. The truth of the matter is that quantity of oratory is no substitute for substantial policies to deliver effective support for students. We have introduced such policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abolition of the vacation hardship allowance must be seen in the light of our overall policy on student support in higher education. The White Paper, "Top-Up Loans for Students", described our intention to share the cost of student maintenance more equitably between students themselves, their parents and the taxpayer. Since then, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
have introduced student loans and established the access funds while removing most full-time students from eligibility for income support and housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have announced our intention to freeze the main rates of mandatory grant for the forthcoming academic year at their present levels. At the same time we will hold steady, in cash terms, the contributions expected from parents whose incomes have risen in line with the rise in average earnings. On Tuesday, I announced our intention to uprate the supplementary allowances payable in addition to the main rates of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing those things, we have not only reshaped and improved on previous arrangements, we have actually increased the resources available to students. In the current year, the full year resources available to students from grant and loan together are 25 per cent, higher than the grant alone in 1989 to 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one of his rhetorical flourishes, the hon. Member for Oxford, East suggested that I had been positively spiteful in my treatment of students. I believe that an increase of 25 per cent, in a year of resources available to students is a curious kind of spite. I would prefer not to use such language, but it might be regarded as spite if the Labour party fulfil its pledge—in the unlikely event that it has the opportunity—to withdraw the loan scheme because, then, students really would be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most eligible students have still to take advantage of the loan facility. Substantial extra resources have been made available to help to support students in the summer, provided that they enter into a loan agreement before 31 July. Against that background, it is clear that there is no longer any need for a separate vacation hardship allowance. All except a few students have had no need of the vacation hardship allowance. We should remember that the allowance was intended only for those on full-time, first-degree courses, not for postgraduates, those in further education or part-time students.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister share the view expressed on behalf of the government by his noble Friend in another place—that the Government were anticipating a flood of claims this summer, and that that is why the benefit is being withdrawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily deal with that in a moment. In the meantime I shall continue with my exposition of the rationale behind the abolition of vacation hardship allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our new arrangements, the minority of students whose needs are not met entirely from the combined grant and loan will now be able to benefit from access funds, which we introduced this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East criticised me for failing to undertake consultation over the abolition of the allowance. However, he is not right to allege that there was no consultation before we announced its abolition. My Department discussed the allowance at regular meetings earlier this year with local authority associations and the NUS about future changes for mandatory awards regulations. At those meetings, we recognised the problems that could result from a potential avalanche of claims and we suggested various means of tackling them. In the end, however, we concluded that none of the alternatives offered a satisfactory solution, and that the best course of action would be to abolish the vacation hardship allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East made an intervention about the possibility of a flood of unnecessary claims for the allowance this summer. He will be aware that there was a campaign to encourage students to claim it. We knew about that and it was necessary, and our responsibility, to examine the implications of such a flood of claims. A range of factors influenced our judgment on the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had there been such a major flood of claims, local education authorities would have been burdened with processing many extra claims, of which only a tiny minority have proved acceptable. Moreover, the problem would have arisen at the very time when next year's grants must be assessed. I have already mentioned the increased level of resources for students and the availability of access funds. In those circumstances it was our view, that the overwhelming majority of claims would have had to be rejected—and quite properly so. Why should this be so? I owe the Committee an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the regulations authorities had to be satisfied that applicants were suffering, or were likely to suffer undue hardship before paying the vacation hardship allowance. Authorities also had to take account of student' means before making their decision. If an allowance were payable, theamount to be paid had to be determined. The allowance was not a fixed sum, but payable according to student' means up to a maximum of £53·50 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, any authority would have to be certain that any applicant had exhausted other sources of public support, and that there was no scope for temporary employment for an individual student during the long vacation. Other sources of public support any loan facility that may be available to a student; access funds administered by his institution or income support and housing benefit to which students or their partners remain entitled. To ascertain such facts would have been a complex and extensive administrative burden on authorities especially as it would have led them to conclude, in almost all cases, that the allowance was not payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make too much of the argument that local education authorities would have been overburdened because it is their duty to ensure that students receive benefits to which they are properly entitled. However, we judged it right to avoid the waste of time and effort which a flood of rejected claims would have meant, and—very important in the interests of students—the delays that that would inevitably have caused to next year's grant payments, those delays would have affected grant claims and the welfare of many students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We concluded that it would be wrong to stand by and allow a flood of such claims, prompted by an organised campaign, to cause local education authorities' awards offices to seize up at the worst possible time of year. All the indications at the grass roots, from LEAs, were that they were worried about the prospect of having to deal with so many unfounded claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must get the position of the local authorities clear. I have received letters from local authority associations that make it clear that they were not pressing for abolition of the student vacation hardship
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
allowance. They wanted clear guidance from the DES on the way in which the allowance was to operate. A letter from the Association of County Council states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be unjust to infer … that LEAs would have pressed for abolition of the hardship allowance … in preference to the other options".</p></blockquote>
In particular, the association refers to offering guidance to LEAs and amending the regulations to clarify the circumstances under which hardship might be established. The LEAs weie not pressing for abolition and the Government were wrong to rest their case on supposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to press the Minister about the concession. He said that there might be a small minority of justified claims. It is a slur on students to imply that large numbers would have submitted bogus claims. Will the Minister make it clear that that is not what he is suggesting? Given that he recognises that there would have been justified claims what will happen to those people if the new regulations are accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On representations from the local authority associations, student support is not a matter for them. That is implicit in the letter from the Association of County Councils that the hon. Gentleman quoted. It is not for them to determine the overall structure of the system of student support. What is important is for them to ensure that the system is administratively feasible and can be handled properly. If they are suggesting that one option would be for the Government to issue greater clarification and spell out the regulations that define eligibility, that is a reasonable point for them to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that it would have been incumbent upon awards offices to satisfy themselves that in every individual case a student was properly entitled to vacation hardship allowance. As I have explained, that would have entailed a massive amount of difficult work to ensure that they understood the detailed circumstances student by student. We had to conclude that that was an unreasonable demand to place upon LEAs and that the most important thing was to ensure that next year's grant assessments were not placed in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether or not a minority of students might still prove to have been eligible under the regulations, one can only speculate. It is a possibility that I do no discount. Again, as I explained in my earlier remarks, we must look at the abolition of the vacation hardship allowance in the context of the substantial overall increase in student support that we have introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East saw fit to make reference to remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Mr. Scott), the Minister for Social Security and Disabled People, in debates last year. It is true to say that in debates on social security and housing benefit, my right hon. Friend made reference to the existence of the vacation hardship allowance facility. The hon. Gentleman quoted only part of my right hon. Friend's speech and that quote was not entirely in context. I remind him that my right hon. Friend said of the Social Security Advisory Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not have to accept every word and condition that it puts forward."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i>18th July 1990; Volume 176 column 1101.]</p></blockquote>
Nothing that my right hon. Friend said in those debates entailed a commitment from the Government to preserve the vacation hardship allowance in perpetuity. No responsible Government would commit themselves to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
preserving an allowance for ever and a day. The right way to act is to observe the pattern and development of events. In that context, it is important to focus on the facility for student loans, which represents a major increase in student support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East mentioned housing benefit. Our survey demonstrated that the average claim for students who would have been entitled to benefit was about£327 per annum, whereas the loan for students outside London is worth£420 a year, and more for those in London. It is interesting that at this stage of the academic year at least three quarters of students eligible to take advantage of the loan facility have not done so. That leads us to believe that considerable unclaimed resources are still available to students. Therefore our decision to abolish the vacation hardship allowance must be seen in a different light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If conditions for students are as penurious as the hon. Gentleman claims, it is curious, is it not that the flood of applications from young people who want to go on to higher education continues. Last year, even when everyone knew that the loan system was to be introduced, applications from 18 to 19-year-olds increased by 10 per cent. This year, applications through the Universities Central Council on Admissions and the Polytechnics and Colleges Admissions System, are estimated to have increased by about 9 per cent. It seems highly improbable that if our system really condemned students to live in hardship, there would be that enormous surge in applications from young people wanting higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that our system of student support, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) said, is conspicuously generous by international standards, enables an increasing number of young people to take the opportunity of higher education mat we and, I would have thought, the hon. Member for Oxford, East, want for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East said much about access funds. We introduced them to help students who might experience difficulty. Higher education institutions are at liberty to use the funds to provide financial help when students face financial difficulties for whatever reason, including physical or other disability. The£25 million made available for access funds this year comes on top of the 25 per cent. increase in resources for students from grant and loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The access funds, if properly targeted, are a significant discretionary supplement to the main system of student support. The£13 million in the undergraduate fund available to support students who are in financial difficulties compares favourably with the£50,000 which, typically, has been claimed for vacation hardship allowance. Even taking account of every possible contingency that the hon. Member for Oxford East dreamt up, the funds available to help students facing hardship have been increased enormously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to allow institutions to decide how best to target access funds, including provisions for summer vacation needs. The hon. Gentleman suggested that institutions found it difficult to plan the use of those funds. However, he cannot have it all ways. He should recollect that there were apprehensions about institutions being slow off the mark in releasing access funds to students, because of the new system. Yet by the end of the financial year—31st March—institutions were encouraged to release those
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
funds. The original condition was a factor that we hoped would encourage institutions to make their dispositions rapidly to ensure that students did receive the benefit of access funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We listened to representations made by institutions, which emphasised the importance of greater discretion. It was made clear that institutions should not be required to dispose of such a large proportion of access funds by 31 March. We accepted that. In early February—still relatively early in the history of this issue—we made it clear that we would relax the condition, so that institutions had the freedom to apply access funds over the whole academic year, including the summer vacation, up to 31 August. The hon. Gentlemen's complaint does not bear close scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also taken further measures to assist certain groups of students—the disabled, lone parents and partners of students—have retained their eligibility for housing benefit and income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the commitment given by the Secretary of State for Social Security to monitor operations, may I ask how that monitoring has gone and what are its results? What plans do the Government have to monitor students living in exceptional hardship during the summer as a result of the abolition of the allowance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All institutions have been asked to report details of their experience during the first year, which will conclude in the autumn. Funding councils with the responsibility for distributing access funds to individual institutions, are also due to report their impressions. We have also said that we shall review the whole system after three years. We are clearly fulfilling our undertaking to keep the system's operation under close review. It is comon ground across the Committee that we should ensure that students are not in hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government change the system if there are proven cases of students facing hardship this summer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman seriously expects me to give any commitment on that. However, we shall certainly look carefully at the evidence. It is far better to work on genuine evidence rather than indulge in speculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has tried to suggest that the system of student support, which will greatly increase resources available to support students through the combined uprated grant and loan and the introduction of substantial access funds, is somehow an evil strategy designed to reduce students to hardship. We need less rehetoric of that sort and more systematic analysis of what is really happening. We shall take a responsible view in the light of what we find.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make an observation about the negative procedure before putting the Question. The negative procedure has an obvious function. It does not appear to change anything at all, but it gives the House an opportunity to debate a measure that is already in force. It is a privilege that has been granted to the House by tradition. It means that we do not waste time on the Floor of the House, but remain able to reflect upon and criticise something in a constructive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
However, it is discouraging to find that the special nature of that function is not reflected in attendance in Committee. It is important to put on record that the total absence of Learned Members, on either side of the Committee, is not encouraging and does not add to the import of the privileges that we have. It is important to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever else has been observed, it is true to say that the hon. Members who have spoken have worked hard on their speeches. After they have undertaken such work, perhaps involving considerable research, in order that speeches may have the fullest impact and that we are all satisfied with the conclusion of the Committee, they are not encouraged by the noted absence of other hon. Members. I apologise for having to say that. As I am retiring next year, it does not worry me too much personally, but I hope that hon. Members will have the sense to take note of what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate you warmly, Mr. Leadbittcr, on those remarks. You have made an important point about the operation of parlimentary procedures. This procedure is a means by which hon. Members can express their views on matters of detail without further burdening our time in the Chamber, which would mean that we would have to sit later into the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a briefing note from the CVCP, as other hon. Members doubtless did. The hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) certainly prepared well for his lengthy speech, and the result was worthwhile. Having been reassured by what my hon. Friend the Minister has said, I feel that I am now able to deal with the points made by CVCP. It is significant that nine Conservative Members are present; they could have sought to pair with Opposition Members and thereby been free to attend to some of the numerous other engagements that hon. Members undertake. However, they felt that it was important to be present. It is sad for the hon. Member for Oxford, East that his is a lone and solitary voice on the Opposition Benches. He has acquitted himself well in compensating for the absence of his colleagues, but I hope that we do not hear from him the cant that the Tories do not care. The Tories are here and have listened to the arguments. The Labour Party, which is continually beating its chest on such matters, is wholly absent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can do without the sympathy of the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth). I do not need to cast aspersions on any of his hon. Friends: the hon. Member will know that Conservative Members are required to be present. Some of his hon. Friends are here not because of their interest in the regulations, but to ensure that nothing goes wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might add—this relates to the serious point that you made, Mr. Leadbitter—that were it the experience of hon. Members that the Government were prepared to listen to debate and to amend their policies accordingly, there might be a bigger attendance at such proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not help me very much. I have been brought up in this place to keep at the fore front of my mind the fact that the first responsibility of a Member of Parliament is, totally, unquestionably, and without exception to the House of Commons. I am not worried about whose feathers I ruffle by my comments. The time of those who advise the Committee—Officers of the Departments who carry out parliamentary work and
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
House of Commons officials—is valuable and when there is a serious absence of hon. Members it is a great discourtesy. It is not the first time that I have been in the Chair and had this happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two absences are understandable because hon. Members are busy and one must not forget that they have many other duties. However, when there is significant level of absence, the debate is apparently given less worth. It would be remiss of the Chairman—or indeed of any Member of the House of Commons—not to concern themselves with that. If I am shot this afternoon hon. Members will understand why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) was in the Committee Room when the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) started speaking, but, by the time that he was finished, the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central had gone. In view of your earlier comments, Mr. Leadbitter, I wonder whether you think that the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central has shown the Committee more or less of an insult than his colleagues who never turn up at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman is on safer ground if he or she does not name an hon. Member. I have used the collective term throughout because it is not for the Chairman to offend anyone—indeed, it is not my purpose to offend anyone. If all the absences are legitimate because something important has intruded upon Learned Members' work in the Committee, I am sure that the Chairman will be told. The significant point is that the Chairman must not mention individual Members of Parliament. The Member of Parliament mentioned by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) is an outstanding worker in the House—I have worked with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I concur with your remarks about my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley). He said at the beginning of the proceedings that he had a pressing engagement at half-past eleven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Member who raised the matter has noted that. The end product of all such exercises is that there might be some chance of improvement or the Chairman might be reprimanded. If I am reprimanded I shall take no notice and, if there is an improvement, I shall be pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Laedbitter. you have made a fundamental point. It is the sort of point that we shall miss when you leave this House.
