	<div class='legislation'>Draft Broadcasting (Independent Productions) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Broadcasting (Independent Productions) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
May I welcome you to the Chair, Sir Anthony, and, for the convenience of the Committee, give a short introduction to the order? The Committee will recall that the Broadcasting Act 1990 wrote into the law earlier voluntary agreements by the ITV and BBC networks to take at least 25 per cent. of the qualifying programmes that they broadcast from independent producers by the end of 1992. The order defines qualifying programmes as those that the broadcaster commissions or makes alone and those that have been made in collaboration with others, so long as the broadcaster involved has contributed at least 25 per cent. of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order makes it clear that qualifying programmes do not include advertising, repeats, new coverage, party political broadcasts, Open university and separate items of less than two minutes' duration. The order also defined independent producers as those programme makers in which no single domestic broadcasting company has more than a 15 per cent. shareholding, and which itself has no shareholding above 15 per cent. in any domestic broadcaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nub of the order. I have no doubt that members of the Committee will have some observations to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.31 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I join the Minister in welcoming you to our proceedings, Sir Anthony? The last time I spoke in the House, I provoked the Chancellor of the Exchequer into saying that, in recession, rising unemployment is a price well worth paying to lower inflation. I hope that nothing that I say this morning will provoke the Minister into making such a callous remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delay in bringing the order is all to the good, because the context in which we discuss it is now clearer, following the blind auction bids for the new Channel 3 licences. Independent producers and their productions have a vital part to play in the development of Channel 3, Channel 5 and the BBC, as was set out in the Broadcasting Act 1990, which fathered this order. That Act provides that not less than—those latter three words are important-25 per cent. of total programme time allocated to qualifying programmes shall be from independent producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In a lunatic system that time may reveal has invited over-bidding, which will put a later squeeze on what is seen on the screen in terms of real choice, diversity and quality, some bidders will want not to make programmes but to provide the service that they plan to provide solely as publishers on the Channel 4 model. In other words, they will not make programmes, but will commission them from independent companies. That is new, deliberate and has been made possible by the 1990 Act. I believe that the Government have thought too little about the consequences of that on training, regional commitment and the development of in-house talents and skills at all levels, which has been the basis of the present commercial network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those companies which hold the present commercial television licences have axed hundereds of jobs, closed studios and put the permanent staff who remian on the short-term contracts. It is never-never land. Employees never know from one day or one series to the next whether they will have a job to go to the next morning. Mr. Will Wyatt, the managing director of BBC Network Television warned:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 25 per cent. independent production quota, coupled with Funding for the Future targets, puts a double squeeze on us to achieve the necessary savings.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are closing down studios and premises and cutting programme budgets, but we cannot achieve our targets without reducing the number of jobs."</p></blockquote>
When the previous Prime Minister got a bee in her bonnet that television was rampant with restrictive practices and old Spanish customs based on the former Fleet street model, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission could not please her. It found no such behaviour, but found instead an anxious willingness on behalf of people within the television industry and their unions to be as efficient as possible in the production of quality programmes across the range of tastes and interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has happened elsewhere, what has generated sackings and closures is cash, and the need to save it to fund the sealed bids, which are the basis of awarding the new Channel 3 licences, and also the need to use more independent material. However, the Minister and the Committee should know that there are dangers—I put it no higher than that at present—in what is proposed in the order in relation to qualifying programmes and defining independent producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the two major political parties were persuaded of the value of a 25 per cent. floor for independent productions, it was generally considered that times must change and that there must be room in both the commercial and BBC networks for new talent and ideas. Few people quibble at that. However, it has not worked out like that. Independent producers have been used to squeeze the cost of programming on both networks and, as a result, cheaper programmes have, in the main, been farmed out to independent producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not linger over the tales of "sweetheart" deals, especially at the BBC, where staff producers were tempted to cut the knot with a nice little commission in their pockets if they became independent. I shall pass over the heads of various programme sectors who claim the lone right to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
decide which independent company shall receive a commission and which shall not, and which companies are not allowed to put in bids or tenders. Why should they have that right? They dictate the price. They have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude as too many independent producers are chasing too little work while the main buyers have their eyes on Channel 3 licences. From October, when the Channel 3 licences are known, that may change. Among others, bank managers know that 700-plus independent production companies in and around London, let alone in the regions, will not survive unless such a practice changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to some other factors. Although independent commissions rose from 1,172 hours in 1989 to 1,301 hours in 1990, the average cost per hour fell from 149,000 to 124,000. The publication 
	<i>Television Week</i> for 5 to 9 May states that the cost of local programmes remains static at about £32,000 an hour. It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Media analysts claim the fall is due to the disproportionate share of low-cost, high-volume programmes with low profit margins being commissioned from independents."</p></blockquote>
Moreover, according to Jonathan Davies, managing director of Knowledge Research,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The bulk of commissions are quizzes and low-cost entertainment. Eight companies produce 65 per cent. of independent programme hours, mainly producing music and game shows … The average cost of an independent programme is around £78,000 an hour but ITV's programmes cannot average less than £100,000."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, if programme costs are being reduced in the independent sector, why are they not falling with in-house productions? Independent companies have overheads, too. It could be argued that, as they have fewer commissions spread over those overheads, as a proportion the overheads may be the same or even higher than those of commissioning companies. We must consider the discrepancy in cost that does not help the independents, which must invest many hours and much money in the origination and development of ideas for programmes before they can be submitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Margaret Heffernan, director the Independent Programme Producers Association summed up the issue when she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do have a fear, shared by the Office of Fair Trading, that some broadcasters will respond to the 25 per cent. quota by issuing junk commissions, mostly cheap game shows. OFT calls for the 25 per cent. quota to apply across the whole range of output and that means high-class dramas as well. If any broadcaster thinks that cheap programmes are the answer to the quota, they are wrong."</p></blockquote>
I refer now to the small fine-print provisions, the definition of an independent, and the cross-shareholdings made possible between broadcasters and independents. IPPA complains, rightly, about what it regards as a failure to "trust-bust". The order contains no controls on aggregated shareholdings by coalitions of broadcasters or production companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that, as the Minister will probably tell me, broadcasters will not directly affect the Channel 3 independent commissions, as those will be arranged by a central commissioning executive under guidance of agreed network policy. However, nothing in the order will prevent the development of dangerous
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
cartels. For example, seven Channel 3 licence holders could each take a 14.2 per cent. stake in five or six independent production companies, each specialising in a particular type of programme. Most independents have a major programme strand. The production companies would be controlled entirely by a group of broadcasters who collectively would control their suppliers and a full range of programming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional structure of Channel 3 network makes such collusion inevitable. If that were to happen—the order contains no anti-trust mechanism to prevent it—real competition to supply programmes to Channel 3 would vanish. The industry would be denied the vigorous competition that the Government say that they want to encourage between broadcasters to get the best programmes at the best price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the end of the matter. Those five or six independents would still qualify to bid for a slice of producing the 25 per cent. of independent quota of the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5. That would put them in a very powerful position to limit access for independent productions to a few powerful players.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have told us that one of the main reasons for the Broadcasting Act 1990 was to break up the monopoly in programme supply. As a result of the order, that ambition will be in ruins. The order will also allow four independent producers each to own less than 15 per cent. of a Channel 3 licence holder—thereby effectively controlling it—and still bid to supply the 25 per cent. reserved for independents, regional programming from that licence, and networking programming for Channel 3. Again, they could try to obtain chunks of the reserved independent productions on BBC and Channel 4. If that were to happen—there is nothing in the order to prevent it—it would fix the market in such a way that it would not be much different from the present setup.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister will tell me that if that or anything like it were to happen, the broadcasters and independents concerned would be clobbered by the restrictive trade practices legislation. Given that the order does nothing to prevent that from happening, I do not know how that could be the case. However, if that is what the Minister tells me, I will accept it. If that is not the case, and if such dangerous developments take place between and among broadcasters and independents, will he undertake to introduce an order to sort out the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have moved a long and risky way since they accepted the voluntary agreement defining an independent as one who had no shareholding by a broadcaster. That was cleaner, and left no room for doubt. The order runs higher risks, which were avoidable. There could have been less of a threat to real competition among truly independent companies. IPPA comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be nothing short of catastrophic if all the positive benefits brought about by the 25 per cent. initiative over the past 4 years were to be undone at a stroke by the creation of a small number of new production cartels whose structure would be more complex, more slippery and more pernicious than the old ITV/BBC duopoly."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I do not know whether the Minister is sufficiently concerned to withdraw the order to ponder the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Opposition Member would criticise him if he did so. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] In these changed times, one never knows, but if he does not, he should understand the real risk that he is taking with an industry in turmoil, faced with less cash for programmes and mounting competition from satellite and cable services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to two other matters. I wonder why the 25 per cent. quota is based solely on the status of the programme producer rather than on the cost of production which would have been fairer. As I have shown, the cheaper, low-cost, high-volume programmes have been farmed out. It would be fairer if the order specified the 25 per cent. in terms of each broadcaster's annual programme budget across the whole range of qualifying programmes. The present system may well inflate in-house production budgets and reduce overall turnover and value in the independent sector. That may be another reason why the Minister wants to abandon the order before its starts to breathe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other hole in the order is that it makes no reference to the status of non-EC production companies as regards the 25 per cent. quota. The general agreement on tariffs and trade may prevent barring non-EC producers, but the existing distinctions between co-productions—which are acceptable towards the quota—acquistiions, pre-sales, output deals and commissions are fast-changing and disappearing. The IPPA fears that the lack of clarification about production costs could enable United Kingdom broadcasters to fulfil their quota by massaging acquisition contracts to make them look like independent commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger in that is that the independent quota could be used as an incentive for broadcasters looking for cheap programming to import yet more American and Australian programmes, which would diminish investment in our industry and the possibility of exports, and be culturally damaging to an industry with a good record for quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, neither the order nor the 1990 Act is solely about broadcasters and the executives, managers, accountants and advertising salespeople who, as Robert Harris observed in last week's issue of The 
	<i>Sunday Times,</i> will be about the only people with safe jobs in the present set-up. He forecasted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The closer you get to a camera, studio or cutting room, the more risky your employment will be."</p></blockquote>
The order is also about viewers who have a right to rising standards of quality in terms of real choice, range and diversity. The latest Independent Television Commission "Attitudes to Television" survey, like last year's, shows great demand for more of what I described as scatch-your-head programmes—nature and wildlife, plays and drama, drama documentaries, science and technology and adult programmes—and for fewer quizzes, game shows and soap operas. The order will do little or nothing to serve thier proper interests or the Government's proclaimed aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I believe that there are four gaping holes in the order. First, there are no controls over the creation of a dominating cartel of Channel 3 broadcasters controlling most independent commissions. Secondly, there are no controls over a cosy cartel of major independent production companies carving up the 25 per cent. independent Channel 3 quota between them and still being free to bid for space on Channel 4, Channel 5 and the BBC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is no 25 per cent. cash share of programme spending to the independents. They may get the hours, but not the money to make the programmes that matter. Fourthly, there is no protection for either viewers or independents from broadcasters making non-EC acquisitions look like independent productions, although they originate in the United States or Australia. In turn, that means less opportunity for our domestic talents, less investment, less for export and less real choice for viewers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again to the Minister that his best course would be to withdraw the order and to allow a period of proper consultation, so that he can better try to get it more nearly right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into anything like the detail that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett). Having heard the voice of Jeremiah that we need to hear in our parly system because that is the way in which we obtain balance, it is only right that a balance should be made in the opposite direction. What the hon. Gentleman said should be heeded, but we should not see the order in that perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as the press is strengthened by outside contributions, so can and will television be strengthened. What a farce publishing would be if all that was published came from in-house sources. the cinema is a good example of the reverse way of proceeding. No cinema produces its own films; they take them from independent contributors. The essence of that arrangement, which is to its benefit, is that independents can exploit elesewhere with a single-minded energy and drive in a way that the programme contractors of the past never could. It is important that television should have a more fluid and flexible arrangement now that it is free from technical limitations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Member for Erdington said has to be answered. However, we should take a more positive view. The difficulties that he has enumerated should, if they come to fruition, be dealt with as and when they occur. Having followed the fortunes of broadcasting since the early 1950s, I am reminded that the Labour party has been absolutely consistent in its view. It has always warned that thingss would not work or that they would come to grief. I believe that, as before, so in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I correct the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). He suggested that the advent of independent production was, of necessity, the sole path for the regeneration of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
ideas and the development of more arresting new productions in the cinema. During the years of oligopoly, J. Arthur Rank encouraged the network of independent production companies that lay within his ambit, which often contributed to distinguished productions. It is not necessarily true that exhibition must be completely separate from production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that as background to the order, because —alack, alas—like all such statutory instruments, it cannot be amended. The order is complete; not a single word can be changed. We have to take it as read. That is one of the pities of our system of delegated legislation. It is not satisfactory that a three-and-a-half page document such as this should contain several ambiguities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North spoke about independent production. His theory was that independent producers would be able to concentrate or production and not have the problems of exhibition, and that new ideas would not be inhibited or restricted within the confines of a corporation, where the pattern of production was based on economics. If it gains a reasonable audience, there is no need for change. I assume that the idea behind the notion of independent production is that if it gains a reasonable audience, there is no need for change, and that with competion between production companies, there will be a challenge of ideas to help generate interesting programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That notion has a certain validity. However, the statutory instrument provides safeguards to ensure that independence means what it says, and that there is no intimidation or curtailment—or the corporation by another name. We know that the war chests garnered while the Broadcasting Act 1990 was going through Committee were built up to buy the franchises. Hundreds of millions of pounds are being bid for the franchises. Clearly, that means that the priority is to win franchises, not to make programmes, which means that money for exhibition is being sucked away. We would not want independent production to be used simply as a cheap alternative to make up for the removal of money from production to gain franchises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A valid point was made by the Independent Programme Producers Association in a letter written by Margaret Windham Heffernan that states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that it is crucial for the Stuatutory Instrument to make some reference to the 25 per cent. target being fulfilled by broadcasters in terms of each broadcaster's annual programme production budget across the whole range of qualifying programmes."</p></blockquote>
That would ensure that the chief game shows and quiz shows, which do not require much money or imagination, are not hived off to independent producers. That is not the aim of involving independent producers. They should not be given cheap low-cost, routine and mechanistic productions that do not require much ingenuity, skill or new ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not ensure in the order that a cross section of broadcasters' annual production is involved in independents, and not simply leave that to broadcasters' discretion? That might be a temptation for broadcasters because of the financial constraints
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that are placed on them due to their bids for the franchises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks an important question, which it is sensible for me to answer now. The 1990 Act requires that the 25 per cent. should be spread across all the programme types that the broadcaster produces. It is not possible within the law for independents to be given only the cheaper or easier programmes to make. Because that is already dealt with in primary legislation, it does not need to be repeated in the subsidiary order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. As the Minster will know, I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Stautory Instruments and it is always concerned with the user. It would be helpful if the requirement were repeated in the order—as it does not minimise, diminish or detract—or if there were a note in the explanatory note to that effect. If that weree done, the Independent Programme Producers Assocation, which regarded the order, as a document that stands by itself, would not have gained the impression that the requirement should have been in the order. As the order, rather than the lengthy Act, will be the document of guidance, it might have been worthwhile to repeat the requirement in it. That is possible and not unique.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister, as his comments will be circulated widely and avidly by the industry. The industry can remember to look at the Act—always a useful guide—but statutory instruments often stand by themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 2(2)(a) states that qualifying programmes do not include
	<br><blockquote><p>"a programme which has previously been shown in substantially the same form on the relevant television broadasting service"</p></blockquote>
so repeats are out—and
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) a programme which consists, wholly or mainly, of news."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (3) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A programme may fall within sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (1) above as being commissioned by the relevant broadcaster notwithstanding that it was intended to be first shown commercially in cinemas."</p></blockquote>
Will, for example, a feature film based on a series of programmes, such as the feature film "On the Buses" or "Till Death us do Part"—television has spawned a number of such feature films—be barred under subparagraphs 2(a) and 2(b) because it has been shown in substantially the same form on the relevant television broadcasting service although it was made primarily for the cinema and qualifies under paragraph (3) as an independent production? I raise that point because I should like to see television, which generates significant income, helping the feature film industry. The Minister will know that industry is in difficulties because of the Government's indifference and unhelpful policies. The Government have not remedied the omissions in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3(3) relates to the use of the facilities of a broadcaster by an independent programme maker. I presume that the argument behind that is that a broadcaster should not be able to require an independent producer—as a condition—to use the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
facilities of the broadcaster and not use other facilities. Can the Minister explain the rationale behind that? If facilities are in short supply, as they may be in some circumstances, will the imposition of the use of particular facilites lead to control over programmes? Independents must have access to facilities. Sometimes facilities are very expensive and it does not make sense to leave expensive equipment and stuidos idle simply on the basis that if a broadcaster provides those facilities to an independent producer, that producer will feel subordinate to the broadcaster and independence will be eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is a step on the road to the implementation of the Broadcasting Act 1990. I agree with the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Walden) that it will not help the industry in general. A lot of money has been sucked away from production and that will damage the pictures that people see on the screen. The beneficiaries will not be the viewing public, but the Treasury. The system of bidding for franchises means that war chests have been gathered so that the successful companies can retain their franchises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmigham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett). I am sure that the Minister has seen a copy of the letter from Margaret Windham Heffernan, the director of the IPPA. The first page of that letter contains a paragraph about the possibility of seven Channel 3 licence holders taking a stake in five independent production companies and operating like a cartel. The cartel would be the broadcasting companies by other names. The broadcasting companies could then hive off cheaper productions to low-cost independent producers that will negate the aim of the order. I look forward to the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall preface my remarks by declaring an interest as an adviser to Yorkshire Television. The statutory instrument and our brief gathering this morning are a landmark in the development of the independent sector within television programme making. When we considered in this Room a year ago that part of the Broadcasting Act 1990 which would impose a 25 per cent. quota for independent productions, no one knew the precise form of words that should be used to bring that about. Perhaps some potential abuses, as referred to by the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) may emerge and we may have to return to the matter on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be as well if the Committee was reminded that those independent productions to be commissioned for Channel 3 must be programmes that fit within the licence application—the bid—and must have been submitted to the Independent Television Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point because, listening to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett), it was almost as though companies will meet their 25
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
per cent. threshold by commissioning a lot of cheap rubbish. If there is that amount of cheap rubbish in the programme proposals—which do not include news or programmes of two minutes or less—they are unlikely to pass the quality threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the order is endeavouring to bring into television cannot be looked at in isolation from the obligations which are being entered into in the bidding process. That provides a valuable underpinning of quality that we should not ignore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern that I want to bring briefly to the attention of the Minister is rather different from what has been outlined already. There is a danger that, unless we are careful the independent programme making industry will be centred largely in Soho and the west end of London and not spread throughout the region. Part of the key to that is ensuring that those contractors who are successful in the bidding process have obligations to make programmes within the region. We have made our case about that on many occasions, especially during the proceedings of the Standing Committee which considered the Broadcasting Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was strengthened with regard to regional programmes being made in the region, and we look forward to seeing how the Independent Television Commission will judge that as it assesses the bids that were submitted last week. There is a concern that if too many producer contractors were successful in the bidding process we would see considerably more television made in London for national television and not in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What those who are critical of some of the content of the statutory instrument are suggesting is not entirely borne out by what has happened. I see no trend towards the big six or seven Channel 3 companies ganging up to provide a cartel whereby they control all the independent production. However—I can only speak from my experience with Yorkshire Television—two years ago, we commissioned independent productions from only 12 programme makers and we now commission programmes from 62 independent producers, of whom 40 are based in the region. That is encouraging. The objective of the statutory instrument—the 25 per cent. quota—is welcomed by both sides of the Committee, but some of those matters must be left to trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am far less worried than the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington about whether that trust will be betrayed. I do not believe that that will happen, because the Independent Television Commission will examine closely the quality of the applications. The programme proposals will underpin what can be put out on the air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to what my hon. Friend said. Does he believe, however, that the BBC will not be under the same imperative to buy programmes of quality, because it does not have to pass a quality threshold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. Were we able to consider the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
restructuring of the BBC at the same time as that of Channel 3, we might be able to turn our attention to the question that he raises. On balance, most Committee members would say, "Thank God the BBC is not under the microscope yet." Its time will come when we consider the renewal of the royal charter in 1996. All that we can do is to urge the BBC to play fair, as I believe that the Channel 3 companies will play fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective is to develop and harness new talent and new ideas for British television. That is a worthy objective. In time, it may be possible to improve the wording of the draft order and the presentation of the proposed scheme. However, we must not lose sight of the objective of not merely 25 per cent. independent production, but of independent producers making good television programmes right across the country, not just in London. I hope that the Minister will take that on board when he considers future steps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A considerable number of important questions have been raised, many of them relating to the 1990 Act. The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) suggested that some of those matters should have been repeated in the draft order. It is not the practice, however, to repeat in subordinate legislation chunks of the original legislation, but merely to extend and amplify, as the powers in the Act require to be done in the order. That has been done, but I accept that the 1990 Act is long and complicated, and that several orders flow from it. We must ensure that broadcasters and producers are aware of the opportunities and obligations that the law imposes on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) welcomed the increasing opportunities for independent producers. We do not differ on that point. The difference lies in the fact that the Government recognise the consequences of an increased role for independent producers. That must mean that there is less production by the broadcasters, and, consequently, that they will employ fewer people and fewer of their facilities in production than they did previously. There is no escaping that. The hon. Gentleman recognises, as my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Bradford, South recognise, the benefit to the viewer and the industry from the growth of independents and the attraction of new abilities and ideas to the production of programmes. The viewers, of course, are the prime consideration underlying the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the parent statute imposes on the independent companies an obligation of training—which, as he says, may have many virtues—to ensure that they do not use cut-price, poorly trained people to produce programmes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether there is anything in the original Act about that matter. I shall seek advice about it. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the quality threshold, and the interests of broadcasters, are such that broadcasters
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
will not wish to take programmes from people who do not have the skills to produce good programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Erdington understandably mentioned the contraction of production jobs in the broadcasters. A corollory and counter balance to that is the growth in employment opportunities in the independent sector. The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found no shortcomings in independent television. That is not quite true. The MMC found that shortcomings were being addressed by independent television companies. Few independent television companies do not agree that there is plenty of scope to improve efficiency. They have improved efficiency over the past couple of years, no doubt partly because of the fall in advertising revenue and because of the 25 per cent. undertaking that is in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Bradford, South, it is wrong to say that independents will be free to supply only the cheapest and least demanding programmes. The Act makes it clear that the 25 per cent. applies to all programmes that are broadcast. The full range of opportunities must necessarily be open to independents. The hon. Member for Erdington remarked that some broadcaster-publishers will be involved. Some have applied for licences. If they are successful in their applications they will take their output from independents and others, but not from their own production resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Erdington said that it would be possible for some licensees to unite effectively to control the network through cartel arrangements. He also said that that could happen if several independents joined to take a controlling share in a broadcaster. However, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's fear will be realised, for several reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Act clearly states that cartel arrangements are not permitted, and the Office of Fair Trading is required to police such arrangements. Secondly, the independent schedule that will be devised by the central scheduler will operate as the licensees wish. However, it will have to permit fair and proper access—as the Act requires—to companies in the system and to independents outside it. Let us suppose that it were possible for a series of independents to come together and find that they have a common interest in buying a contractor. Even if they managed to manipulate the scheduling system, it would be difficult to disguise that from the industry and from the OFT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Separate companies have an interest in competing and not in making cartel arrangements, but let us suppose they did so. The scheduler will be obliged to ensure that there is equal access to the network. If there were improper associations, it would be impossible to keep them secret. Moreover, if there were any suggestions that such associations existed, that would trigger an investigation by the OFT, which has a clear mandate under the Act to ensure that competition rules are thoroughly observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. Gentleman's fears will prove to be groundless, but he asked whether I should be prepared to re-examine them if I discover that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
are not groundless in respect of a specific aspect. Of course I shall. the Government want real competition to exist within the network—because that is in the viewers' interest—and we want real, fair and full access to it by independents from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was worried about cheap American imports and suggested that the order should tackle that subject. In fact, the hon. Gentleman himself gave part of the answer to that rather vexed question when he suggested that there might be some problems with GATT. If we legislated that only a specific number of purchases were allowed from the United States—if we put a ceiling on the number or said that none were allowed—that would breach our GATT obligations. However, we need not do that. The ITC, itself as part of its quality threshold, requires that at least 65 per cent. of that which is broadcast by the Channel 3 licensees should be made and commissioned by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible, I suppose, that a licensee will consider that it makes sense to commission a programme from the United States. For example, if a United States production company can produce what ITV needs, at a price and of a kind that the licensee considers will fulfil his obligations under the agreement—bearing in mind the quality threshold—that contractor should be free to do so because that will no doubt be in the interests of his viewers. However, it would not be possible, if that were at the back of his mind, for a large proportion of programmes shown on independent television to be acquired products that were made for other markets, whether in Europe or the United States. Part of the arrangements clearly laid down, by the ITC is that 65 per cent. of programming must be originally commissioned material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that those safeguards meet the hon. Gentleman's anxieties. The changes made by the 1990 Act are fundamental and radical. Therefore, if we find that there needs to be a further review of any of the arrangements made for the industry, the Government will want to do so. However, the order, in conjunction with the 1990 Act, provides an excellent framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) thought that television should involve more fluid arrangements. The order, with the 1990 Act, helps to achieve that. My hon Friend is right to say that we should take a more positive view of the possibilities that are now open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South asked several questions and I have answered one of them. He also asked about films shown in the cinema. If a broadcaster commissions a film and shows it in a cinema, elsewhere or on a video before it is broadcast, it can still be broadcast if it were made by an independent and be part of the 25 per cent. But I stress that that film must be commissioned by the broadcaster and that broadcaster will seldom want to commission a film that it does not intend to show on one of its programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South also asked about the requirement that no broadcaster can insist
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
on the use of its own production facilities when commissioning a work from an independent. Indeed, it may not insist, but if the independent company is interested in using those facilities and has a voluntary arrangement, that is in order. At times, that will be a sensible arrangement. The law forbids a broadcaster insisting that as part of a deal either the facilities that it is offering must be used or, indeed, the facilities that someone else is offering may not be used. Such a requirement would be outside the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister received advice on training and education, which is important? It is some while since I read through the 1990 Act because I have been sleeping well and do not need to read it at night. However, I recall that it contains an imposition on independents to provide training. Will the Minister confirm that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. If I can read the handwriting on the note that I have, I will tell the hon. Gentleman exactly what the position is! There is a requirement on licensed applicants to tell the ITC what proposals they have for training their staff, which can be written into the licensed conditions, but there is no requirement for independents to train staff. However, I trust that market forces will ensure that they do. If they do not produce good examples of programmes, they will not get the business, bearing in mind the competitive nature of that business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) made the extremely good point that independent programme commissions will be made by broadcasters only in terms of the undertakings that they have made in the licence applications, which are their licence agreements and those have to meet the quality threshold. Therefore it is not possible, together with the rules that we have been talking about, for the independent programme producers to be asked to produce across the range of programmes, or to produce programmes that are of low quality. If they do so, and do not meet the licence obligations that the broadcaster has already made, the broadcaster will be failing in its commitment to the ITC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right, but the problem will probably be solved by independents poaching people to obtain quality of production from organisations like the BBC. If evidence is given to the Minister during the next few years when the 1990 Act is operating that that has happened, and that indepenents are not providing their fair share of training, will the Minister consider whether the obligation on broadcasters under the 1990 Act can be extended, perhaps by statutory instrument to independents that take up the greatest proportion of commissioned work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of many reasons for our examining the efficacy of the Broadcasting Act 1990. It is to some extent inevitable that the large organisations and companies will probably provide the bulk of training. Small companies, especially those which are beginning, will not be able to do so. It is easy, however, to under-estimate the training
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
experience that smaller companies will offer, because their people will have had to do a range of jobs. Therefore, inevitably, they will have a range of experience and opportunity that they might not have gained in larger companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although many of the smaller companies will not be able to undertake the formal teaching programmes that the large companies offer, they will contribute to the variety and experience offered to newcomers to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale expressed the fears of many people that independent production will gravitate towards London. This is a widely expressed worry. None of us can predict how the 1990 Act will work, or where independents will be. I cannot say that such worries are groundless, but forces may act in the opposite direction. First, the scheduler will be mindful of costs. One worry expressed by the hon. Member for Erdington is that broadcasters will be greatly pre-occupied with costs, as will independent producers. Production costs are likely to be lower in the provinces than in central London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second possibility is that independent producers will find it useful to be in close proximity to the companies that form the network which are, of necessity, located in different regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should be most grateful if the Minister would address the Chair. That will make it easier for the 
	<i>Hansard.</i> writer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Anthony, to you and to the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reporter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help to reflect that the Independent Television Commission requires 80 per cent. of regional programmes to be made in regions. No doubt many of them will be made by independent producers, which will then find it essential to be in one of the regions, so as to make programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has yet to be decided how the network scheduler will operate. If it has an office in London only, independent producers will tend to move closer to it, but if it sets up a regional framework it may be easier to keep up contact with provincial producers by having a base in the provinces. That would counter pressure to move towards London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I list those possibilities to illustrate that the pressure need not be one way. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale that it would be a pity if everything was concentrated in London. Apart from anything else, the cost of all programmes commissioned from independents would be greater than necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend the Minister says strengthens the decision to go for only 25 per cent. Many of us worry that if there were producer-contractor licences, there would not be sufficient talent or infrastructure in the regions to allow the necessary number of programmes to be generated through independent producers. That would add to the problem of everything being centred on London. If we maintain the level at 25 per cent., it
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
would enable regional independent producers to provide the required number of programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 25 per cent. is the minimum. The publisher licensees that my hon. Friend mentioned may take far more than 25 per cent. from independent producers. Independents will gravitate to the areas that are most convenient for them and that will best facilitate their ability to have their programmes out on the air. So long as the programmes are good, it is right to leave such matters to their decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the changes are designed—as the hon. Member for Bradford, South has intimated—to allow a greater diversity of talent to produce programmes in the industry. The result of the new arrangements will be a wider choice of programmes to broadcast. Together with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990, the order will oblige broadcasters to provide viewers with a wide range of programmes. Viewers' choice will be enhanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to delay the Committee. However, I must respond to the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) who described me as a Jeremiah. If so, it is larger than a one-man club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Robert Harris published an article in The Sunday Times on 19 May. Let me preface my citation by noting that neither he nor his newspaper are known for their affection for the Labour party. On this occasion, it is a well balance article. Robert Harris states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The British have a peculiar genius for destroying whatever they do best. Commercial television, for all its imperfections, has produced some of the finest programmes in the world. Are companies with the traditions of Thames, Granada and Yorkshire really to be treated like shoe stores and knocked down to the highest bidder? The answer, apparently, is yes."</p></blockquote>
As anyone who studies our debates last year on the Broadcasting Bill will know, the Opposition are far from Luddite about the opportunities and possibilities in the changed television climate. Far from it. In a nutshell, our argument has been that the Government have got it wrong because they have been mesmerised by technology without thinking through the purpose for which it should best be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to reply to the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) who may have inadvertently given a mistaken impression of his views. He should recognise that the BBC has made it crystal clear that it is totally committed to the 25 per cent. independent quota; and to producing a range of quality programmes that are probably unsurpassed in the world. May I quote again from Mr. Will Wyatt, the managing director of network television, who said on the subject of difficult times for many industries:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Television is no exception, and the BBC must spend the public's money as wisely as possible in order to put the best possible programme services on the screen."</p></blockquote>
That should be made as clear as possible so that there can be no doubt about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for answering some of the issues that have been raised by Opposition Members. However, he has not dealt adequately with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the problems created by a consortium of broadcasters and a gaggle of independents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He says that there is no point in stopping those developments.

That must be so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish. There is nothing in the order to prevent these developments. The Minister wants the Committee to accept that there is no point in stopping because the central network scheduler for Channel 3, aided by the OFT, will pounce like an angry cat on a new-born mouse if broadcasters associate and, in the opinion of the OFT, its effect is to deny equal access.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not simply that. It is unlawful for broadcasters to associate in that way, as the 1990 Act makes clear.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that that was meant to be helpful and perhaps I am being a bit dim, but there is nothing in the order or the 1990 Act to prevent one or more broadcasters deciding to take up to a 15 per cent. holding in an independent company. I understand, although perhaps not as well as some members of the Committee, that the prime purpose of doing so is to make a buck out of it, otherwise why do it? However, there is a risk of a cosy relationship developing. It would stretch reason beyond belief to suppose for example, that when a single Channel 3 licence holder with a 15 per cent. slice of the major independent production facility—it is no longer a fellow working from his bedroom on a lap-top—places commissions it would not give first thought or refusal to the independent production company in which the broadcaster has the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an easy area, but in the placing of independent commissions it matters first and foremost who you know, as in many other businesses. When a person makes a telephone call or meets someone, it is important that he and the track record of his company are known. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South said, that puts pressure on independent producers to congregate in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Good as independent production houses in Birmingham, Bradford or Manchester may be, unless the producers hang about close to Charlotte Street or somewhere else in Soho—where the bulk of broadcasters congregate—it is a case of out of sight, out of mind. Broadcasting is a hard business, even leaving aside the licences. There are too many companies after too few commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of two or three broadcasters who together have a dominant share in a major, independent production facility. It appears that they are doing very nicely from commissions for the network. The central networking scheduler is happy
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
because he is persuaded that that is no more than an accident—horses for courses—because the broadcasters specialise in what he wants. However, the OFT says, "Not so fast, Tonto. There is something wrong." The OFT whistle them in and ask what is going on. The central scheduler says, hand on heart, "On the day, your honour, this was the best available in quality, price, service and speed of production. It is pure coincidence that three commissions in a row have gone to that production company." Even if the OFT took an interest in the case, it would be exceptionally difficult to sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has wheeled the OFT—and the BBC—into this area. However, I think that the reality will turn out to be awfully difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been cleaner not to have allowed cross-shareholdings. The Minister could have taken another route in this order. I understand why major production companies say, "Unless we become big and develop some muscle, we'll get screwed by the broadcasters." We are not talking about an open playing field, with lots of equal people running around trying to flog stuff and get commissions. I understand the commercial pressures on the independent companies; they need to be big to face up to those who hold the licences to ensure that they earn the proper price for the programmes that they are asked to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have had a two-tier system. For those independents with up to a 15 per cent. holding in a broadcaster, or in whom one broadcaster or more has up to a 15 per cent. holding, we could have restrained the right to bid for some of the independent productions available around the network. Those independents are not truly independent under the terms of the original voluntary agreement. The others, which do not have that shareholding, by themselves or in themselves, could have been totally unfettered. That would be rigging the market, in a sense, but it is not a totally free market in my terms—although perhaps it is in the Minister's terms, politically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the order, which allows cross-shareholdings, does not make the playing field level for every independent company. I acknowledge that in this case it can never be completely level, because decisions turn on experience, track record, price, and so on. However, if the Minister were really interested in encouraging the development of more independent productions, that would have been one way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South that by and large, the BBC has trained more people in television than any other organisation? That situation is likely to continue, because traditionally, the industry has relied on poaching. In case the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) thinks that I am again being a Jeremiah, let me tell the Committee that when Sky Television started broadcasting, not only did it poach its entire staff—perhaps it had no alternative, because it had not been in the business long enough to train them—but it did not, and, as far as I know, still does not have any training plans. When I visited the organisation, one excitable spokesman said rather
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
flippantly, "Things are getting so difficult that we may have to start training ourselves."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there will be problems. I am sorry that we could not persuade the Minister to withdraw the order, although I thank him for his undertaking to keep its operation under review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want very briefly to respond to a couple of the remarks of the hon. Member for Erdington, because the subject is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations from the independent sector show that it would like the possibility of investing in broadcasters and receiving some investment from them. There is no agreement as to what that level should be—some put it higher than the 15 per cent. figure, some lower. However, to have a very much lower amount would mean the Government denying independents the possibility of making useful investments for themselves in an area about which they have expertise and can make judgments. The Office of Fair Trading advise us that 15 per cent. is large enough to be a useful investment, but not high enough to permit control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Erdington was worried that if a number of independents invested up to 15 per cent. in a single broadcaster, they might act in concert. However, they would have no interest in doing that because the other independents would not want to take from one of their number a programme that was excessive in cost or not good enough in quality which they would be unable to get on the network and which would vitiate the financial benefit of their investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The hon. Gentleman should think carefully about the words that he used. He said that what counts is who one knows. I agree that that is an influential factor in many decisions, but if it is true, it is probably better to know everybody and not have an investment of 15 per cent. because such an investment would be well known and would excite attention in the industry about how programmes are commissioned. The OFT would have to consider carefully such interest and suspicion. The hon. Gentleman underestimates the OFT's ability to investigate thoroughly what prices were paid, how agreements were reached and what other opportunities were open to that licensee from other independents at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Erdington, the OFT is better able to ensure the fair activity of an independent which has marked itself out by taking up to a 15 per cent. holding in a broadcaster than it can control the mass of independents when the relationship is only personal. That anxiety, which is widely felt, is met in the 1990 Act and the OFT has a continuing role. I am certain that the hon. Gentleman's fears are not justified, but if there is any sign that they may be, we shall reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
