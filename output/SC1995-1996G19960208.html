	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 21, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and, in any case falling within paragraphs (a)-(c) above, it is a body which makes, or can be expected to make, provision for social housing consistent with an assessment as to the need for such housing made by the Corporation in accordance with section 3(1A) below.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 1, in Clause 3, page 3, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Prior to establishing the criteria for registration in accordance with sub-section 1 above, the corporation shall make and publish an assessment of the scale and range of social housing needs having regard to such estimates or guidance as the Secretary of State may from time to time issue, and other relevant estimates including those made by local housing authorities, and, insofar as it may be practicable, the number of existing social housing landlords, and their actual and potential capacity to meet current and anticipated future needs for social housing.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Winterton. On Tuesday, I recalled the fact that, when the previous Housing Bill was discussed in Committee, it was chaired by die hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) together with Mr. Me William. It seems auspicious that such matters are being kept in the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with the eligibility for registration under clause 2. The Bill makes it clear that certain types of organisation are eligible for registration, such as charities, industrial and provident societies and companies limited by guarantee. Amendment No. 6 would require that such organisations must be in existence to provide social housing and must do so in a way that is consistent with the Housing Corporation's assessment of the need for social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The linked amendment would require the Housing Corporation to undertake an assessment of housing needs and an assessment of the capacity of existing social landlords to meet those needs. Registration should not just be a mechanical process. At our previous sitting, we discussed the fact that there is a large number of registered housing associations, many of which are, to all intents and purposes, dormant. We would not be doing a service if the new register of social housing landlords became a fat document containing large numbers of organisations that made no positive contribution towards meeting social housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
The register should be a meaningful document. It should be prepared on the basis of a clear understanding of the needs for social housing and the capacity of existing social housing landlords to meet those needs. Those capacities will vary from region to region; no overall national rule will need to be adopted. It is important that the Housing Corporation, which is responsible for registration, faces up to such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable debate has taken place over many years about social housing needs. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is a member of the Committee. He is the Chairman of the Environment Select Committee, which has been carrying out a thorough investigation into the issue. It will be publishing a report in the near future. Hopefully, that will throw more light on what is an extremely important, but controversial, subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After many years of almost Trappist silence on the matter, the Government have produced some estimates of need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that two Conservative members of the Committee have also been examining the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only too happy to acknowledge the existence of other members of the Committee who are also members of Environment Select Committee. I knew of their interest in the subject when I, too, was a member of that Select Committee and I hope that they will contribute to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the remarks of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) at the end of our previous sitting, we must ensure that the report is not sent to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all look forward to reading the report. Whether the Minister will look forward to reading it is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have for many years drawn a veil of secrecy over estimates for housing needs, so the publication of estimates last summer was a pleasant surprise. Those estimates were extremely cautious, implying that the level of need for social housing was no more than 60,000 units per year. Most other organisations and specialists who have examined the subject recognise that the need is rather larger; figures vary, but tend to group around 100,000 new homes for social housing purposes per year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important matter, which should exercise the Housing Corporation when it decides how many more organisations should be considered for registration as social landlords and to what end their particular emphases should be directed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the register is to mean anything, it must have regard to social housing needs, but it must also have regard to the capacity of existing organisations to meet those needs. The Housing Corporation has recently had a presumption against the registration of many new housing associations, which have found it difficult to become registered, mainly because of the large number of existing associations. Will the same presumption apply in the case of new registered social landlords other than housing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
associations? How will the corporation assess the need to register new social landlords as opposed to new housing associations? What factors will it take into account? Will it have regard to the existence of other bodies in the area that are able to meet social housing needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are important questions, and should be taken on board, especially as the funds available for new development by social housing landlords are diminishing. During the past two years, there have been sharp cuts in the budget for the Housing Corporation's approved development programme. In each of those years, £300 million has been removed, reducing the budget to a limited size, given that, according to most commentators, the output of social housing is inadequate to meet the country's need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the sum available for allocation as grant to social housing landlords is being reduced, and as there is potentially an increasing number of applicants—given that there will be many bodies that want to acquire social housing landlords—there will be a problem. The corporation should not deal with that on a case-by-case basis, but should have a strategic view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the corporation should make an assessment in advance of the need for social housing and of the capacity of existing social housing landlords to meet those needs. There should not need to be ad hoc or arbitrary judgements on individual applications. The process should be rational and well informed, taking account of those wider consideration, so I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendments. Like the amendments we discussed on Tuesday, they are constructive and are designed to improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Winterton. Your co-Chairman, Mr. McWilliam, has clearly decided to preside over the Committee with draconian ferocity, and almost all its members were reprimanded at least once during our first sitting, including me. We come here psychologically prepared to be chastised by you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the tone of the remarks of the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), although, for reasons that I shall make clear, I cannot accommodate him on the amendments. He raised three issues. The first was the criteria for registration, which we discussed on Tuesday. I said that, although one should abide by the legal criteria of eligibility, the process was expected to be subtle and, as time went by, those criteria could be revisited as the sector became more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, I had the pleasure of giving evidence to the Select Committee on the Environment, which is so ably chaired by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). I understand that that Committee's report on housing needs is due out shortly. We all agreed that it is an extremely complex business, which is largely about forecasting, but with a great many variables. I look forward to the publication of that report. However, one cannot extrapolate from that that the Housing Corporation should duplicate the assessment of need. The corporation has a clear role, which is becoming larger and more complex. It should not become a housing needs think tank—the machinery already exists for that—because it
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
would duplicate the work of the Department and its consultants in assessing housing need and because it has no expertise in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, at that Select Committee hearing, the Housing Corporation's chief executive said that the corporation has
	<br><blockquote><p>"not got an independent view of these assumptions".</p></blockquote>
He also said that the need for social housing depended
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the long term propensity for owner occupation and on the long term changes in the private rented sector … I think it is the Government, with their overall assessment of macroeconomic prospects that are much best placed to take final authoritive decisions on such broad long term trends".</p></blockquote>
The argument is not made, and I must resist the amendment. Later today, I hope to be more accommodating to the Opposition, but amendment No. 6 is superfluous and would confuse and unnecessarily duplicate the corporation's role. I wish to see the corporation focus clearly on the expanding role that it now has before it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Winterton. I am sure that you will not be as draconian as Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Minister with interest, but I have great difficulty in agreeing with his conclusions. Surely the key aim of putting public money via the Housing Corporation into providing social housing is to meet housing need. I understand that there may be duplication, but the Select Committee on the Environment will report on the country's needs and how they can be measured. The Housing Corporation should be considering those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me most is that the Government's estimates are always much lower than anyone else's. In the White Paper, the Government estimated that 70,000 new social housing units a year were needed, but most people believe that 100,000 are needed. That is what worries me about the Minister's response. I hoped that he would say that he might think again once he had seen the Select Committee's report on housing need. Everyone concerned with social housing believes that it is important that the Minister should return to the subject once the report is published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few brief remarks about social housing. I and other members of the Select Committee on the Environment are still struggling to produce a report, so this may. not be a particularly helpful time to talk about it. However, I wish to praise the Government, and particularly the former chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, West (Mr. Jones), who chaired the inquiry into the Housing Corporation. Several other members of this Committee also took part in that inquiry. One of its recommendations was that the Government should produce figures for housing need. I was pleased that that recommendation was met last summer, albeit a little late. It was good to see someone become a Minister and not be forced by his colleagues to stand on his head. He managed to get the figures published, which was a great help in the housing debate. I give the Government full credit for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise also that the Government said that the figures were estimates and that they were intended to encourage debate. Again, that was welcome. I should have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
thought that there was some advantage in encouraging everyone involved with housing to submit their estimates of what was needed. The Housing Corporation should have the expertise to offer a view on that mater. Therefore, I should have thought that the amendment was attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no precise figure; it is a matter of everyone submitting their ideas, out of which some sort of consensus might emerge. Certainly, some arguments would emerge, especially within Government, about the allocation of resources under the public expenditure round. Therefore, it is in the Government's interest to publish the figures, ensure that there is a widespread debate and encourage any official housing bodies to produce estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering the registration of associations, it is important to have a clear idea whether numbers are the biggest problem,—whether there really is a crisis and too few dwellings are being built, especially in the social sector—or whether the quality and location of dwellings is the more serious problem. It is especially important to have a clear idea about the allocation of resources—that is, whether resources should go to existing housing associations to increase their stock, or whether it should go to new associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the crucial issues about the allocation of resources is the amount of grant. If grants go to existing housing associations with large portfolios, they might be able to produce a few more dwellings and, by averaging out the rents across their stock, not charge high rents. I am increasingly concerned to hear that, in my constituency people can move into housing association property only if they are on benefit. People in full-time work find it extremely difficult to pay the rents that are being charged. That is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If new associations—which are starting up under the present grants and without many dwellings to alleviate costs—are to be registered, it probably means that the highest rents will be charged. Such new associations will not be able to average out rents. So there are considerable implications for rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many bedsits within the existing stock of some housing associations. In the information that the Select Committee received, there was increasing evidence that elderly people do not like living in bedsits. Problems can arise in mixed developments when young, single people, or perhaps people with mental health or alcohol problems, live in bedsits close to elderly people. One or two housing associations have told me that they would like to be able to convert bedsits into one-bedroom or two-bedroom properties. Again, such work depends on the amount of money needed and the allocation of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should encourage the Housing Corporation to set out its policies and figures and balance the absolute figures against the quality of dwellings and rents charged. Given the Government commitment to much more open government, it would be sensible for the Housing Corporation to publish its agenda, which would remove the impression mat it secretly creeps up to the Government to give them some advice. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded by the Opposition's arguments. Of course, there will be a debate on housing need. In a sense, the Select Committee will establish the
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
groundwork for that debate, and the Government will respond fully to the Select Committee report. I have no doubt that that debate will continue. But would it be sensible for the Housing Corporation, independently and with its own cash and expertise—which it disclaims in this matter—to start generating its own sets of figures for need? The figures are uncertain and necessarily fall into the political arena. As the corporation has said that it would not welcome the role, we must have some respect for its views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions with the Housing Corporation take place about the best means of delivering various targets, the best mix of expenditure and the best way of using resources. Of course, the corporation must play a central role in that. The expertise in the development of the estimates is becoming more established and, although it is an imprecise science, much work is going into it. We are trying to improve the quality of our forecasting and the Select Committee report will be valuable in helping us to do that. I persist in my belief that it would be wrong for the Housing Corporation to duplicate that role, so I must resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not regard the Minister's response as either helpful or adequate. The Housing Corporation has enormous responsibilities. Even with the cuts in the budget that I described, it is still disposing of more than £1 billion of public money and is responsible for the registration—or non-registration—of organisations that want to act as social housing landlords, who are fundamental to providing homes for people in need throughout the country. For the Housing Corporation to have that role without being required to undertake an initial appraisal of the needs for social housing and the ability of existing social landlords to meet those needs is a strange proposition. I am astonished that the Minister is even suggesting it. We shall press the amendment to a Division because there should be a proper assessment of needs and the capacity to meet them before the registration process takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>On accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(g) engaging in other activities for the promotion of the social and economic well-being of residents, provided that these shall be incidental to its purposes under subsection (2).'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 9 in page 2, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(g) providing services or amenities to the tenants of other registered social landlords, local authorities or other public bodies.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment brings us to the definition of the permissible activities of registered social landlords. Subsection (2) contains basic conditions that must be satisfied: the body must not trade for profit and must be established for the purpose of "construction, improvement or management" of housing. Those conditions, which are slightly amplified, are the key requirements of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (3), additional purposes are identified. Those include
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing land, amenities or services, or providing, constructing, repairing or improving buildings"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"acquiring, or repairing and improving … houses to be disposed of on sale"—</p></blockquote>
outright or "on shared ownership terms", and other similar purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surprising that no general power is available to social housing landlords to act to promote the economic and social well-being of residents in their housing, provided that that is incidental to the main purposes for, which they are established. That is a necessary and appropriate role, especially as it is widely recognised that the provision of bricks and mortar alone is not sufficient. A wider view must be taken of the purposes of social housing and its contribution towards meeting other social objectives—for example, employment, community development or, in certain cases, community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of any general power to undertake such activities is a weakness. Associations that legitimately wanted to do useful and constructive work ancillary to their main purpose could be discouraged from doing so, which would be unfortunate. I shall give two examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of care to elderly or disabled tenants is increasingly recognised as a vital component of a policy of providing adequate housing and enabling elderly or disabled people to live in the community. That responsibility may be discharged by local authority social services or by other means. Housing associations such as the Abbeyfield societies or those that provide sheltered or very sheltered housing, such as Anchor housing association—both bodies are well known to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—recognise the need to provide more than just bricks and mortar and housing management. To keep elderly and frail people adequately housed often requires an input of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions arise about the borderline between housing management and care. Such questions have exercised many people, not least those responsible for devising housing benefit regulations. No doubt the Minister has had interesting and possibly lengthy discussions with his colleagues in the Department of Social Security on such matters. It would be unfortunate if too narrow and rigid a definition of permissable purposes prevented the provision of appropriate care to people who need it in order to remain in that accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would give two examples. Care is an obvious one; the second is employment. We recognise in many of our new developments, particularly in inner city
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
regeneration, the importance not only of providing good quality housing, but of helping people in areas of high unemployment to obtain work. Great emphasis has rightly been put on initiatives that will make it possible for local people to be trained and to participate in the building work involved in turning around their areas. Such local labour schemes have been very successful in a number of areas, and it is right that social housing landlords should be interested in promoting that kind of activity, which is ancillary to their fundamental one of providing housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that such activities are permissable. The Minister may say that there is no need to worry because there is a general power in subsection (6), which enables the Secretary of State to specify other permissable activities by order. I suppose that we will be told that the Secretary of State could use that to cover an association that had undertaken an activity, which was then challenged as being beyond its powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken two objections to that point of view. First, it is wrong not to specify or allow for the types of activities that I have described when subsection (3) spells out permissable ones. Secondly, while the Secretary of State may wish to be thought of as benevolent, not all of us believe that he is, and not everyone is satisfied that he will always come to the rescue if an association is taking part in an activity that is challenged. It may be a perfectly legitimate activity, designed to further the interests and promote the well-being of residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is whether there should be powers written into the Bill so that everyone is clear about it, or whether the matter should be left to the discretion of the Secretary of State. The Opposition favour a more explicit statement. I stress that we are not proposing giving a blanket power to social landlords to do all sorts of things that are quite separate from their main purpose; it is about enabling them to undertake activities that are incidental to their main purpose, but which provide benefits to their residents and the communities in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 refers to the ability of social housing landlords to provide services to other bodies. That, again, is not explicitly permitted in the Bill. We talked on Tuesday about the value of the diversity of the housing association movement and as more social housing landlords become registered, that diversity should increase. Inevitably, some will specialise in certain areas and will be able to provide specialist assistance to others. An obvious example is the provision of a community alarm service. Residents can be linked up to a central alarm, so that if they are worried, fall, or there is a break-in, they can ring for help. It is not economic for such services to be provided individually by each social housing landlord, it is recognised that such services are best promoted by one body and then made available to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
others. Obviously, if a social housing landlord undertakes to organise a community alarm system, he would want to be satisfied that it will be within his powers to do so not just for his residents but for other landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 refers to social housing landlords
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing services or amenities to the tenants of other registered social landlords, local authorities or other public bodies."</p></blockquote>
The amendments are common sense and would ensure that an ambiguous part of the Bill is clarified. I hope that the Minister will have less difficulty in accepting them than our previous amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go all the way with the hon. Gentleman, but I have a suggestion that he might find helpful. As the Committee will know, registered housing associations have traditionally had a range of additional permissible purposes beyond the specific provision of housing for rent. That allows them to use their expertise in a range of activities, which support the provision of housing and from which tenants can enjoy benefits. The Bill contains a list of such purposes or objects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the benefits that can flow from that, but the limitations placed on the activities of associations are an important element in their regulation. They prevent an association from undertaking activities that extend beyond the expertise and competence of the management committee and that could threaten the commercial viability of the association, bringing risks to tenants and to the public funds that are invested in the association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause takes as its starting point the permissible purposes and objects enshrined in the Housing Act 1985. It allows us to introduce further additional purposes if new activities are identified that would be appropriate for associations. We shall bring forward an order at commencement that will cover the additional items included in the current secondary legislation, which would have been unwieldy to include in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are somewhat loose and wide. Amendment No. 8 proposes that landlords should be able to engage in
	<br><blockquote><p>"other activities for the promotion of the social and economic well-being"</p></blockquote>
of tenants. That would open up the possibility of associations moving some way from their primary housing objects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that the amendment states that associations can engage in other activities

We have made it clear that they cannot move into other activities as their main purpose; other activities are acceptable only when they are incidental to the main purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a suggestion which I hope will enable me to meet the hon. Gentleman half way. We are prepared to consider possible new activities, and would consider any clearly defined proposals when we prepare the order to which I have referred.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the question of care, which could also be included if it were defined not in such specifics that would allow no flexibility, but as a bracket of permissible activities. I am willing to discuss such matters with the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock), to establish whether we could arrive satisfactorily at specific purposes that could be included in the order. That would meet some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and it would also meet some of mine, as I do not want there to be a general enabling power, which I fear could, in extreme cases, put at risk the primary purposes of the associations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that intention—to discuss whether we could arrive at what he wants to achieve through the mechanisms that I should like to use—so that we can come to an accommodation that would improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is half welcome news from the Minister. Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, I am particularly concerned about care in the community, as I represent a constituency with a high number of elderly people—one of the county council divisions contains the highest number of over-85s in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Greenwich and most members of the Committee, I recognise that the provision of the physical building of a house is not the full story. There has been much discussion in recent years between parties about regenerating communities and providing care in the community. Many more people are living to a much greater age, and a wide variety of ways to enable people to stay in the community have been developed. The Bill should build on such developments. I prefer matters to be spelt out clearly in the Bill—that is a theme that we shall return to time and again. I do not want to repeat myself too often, but I say again that, although I do not doubt the Minster's good intentions, there will be different Ministers, and we have seen how things change when a new Minster uses his powers. The matters that we are discussing are so important that we should ensure that what the Minister is offering is set out in an acceptable form. That is a fundamental difference between myself and the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Christchurch said, the Minister has gone a little way towards meeting our concerns. Given that the Housing Corporation spent much of the previous year promoting the concept of housing plus, it would be astonishing if he had not. We must recognise that housing plus is part of the agenda for social housing landlords. If the amendment were rejected out of hand, I would have said that the Minister was saying one thing, but doing another. However, I shall not stray into that territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's assurance that he is willing to look at the matter. We do not want it to be made subject to orders, but prefer that it is set out in the Bill. However, as we are confident that the Secretary of State who will be responsible for the orders will be a Labour Member of Parliament, we are happy to accept the Minister's offer.

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Once again, the amendment refers to the powers of associations. It would delete the words "for a limited period" that relate to activities undertaken by social housing organisations, which are incidental to their main purpose. The Bill enables associations and other social landlords to acquire properties that have been run as businesses. That is almost inevitable in urban regeneration. If an organisation buys a block of flats that has shops on the ground floor, it would have to deal with the commercial properties. It would be bizarre if social housing organisations were prevented from acquiring such properties, especially as the Government have rightly focused on the number of empty flats above shops and the need for them to be returned to use. A housing association or other social landlord can often do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are obvious occasions when, incidental to their main purposes, social housing landlords acquire premises that exist essentially for commercial purposes. The Bill will allow for that, but only for a limited period. The Minister will be aware of the number of housing associations that run their own charity shops. For some years, I was a member of the Notting Hill housing trust committee. It has run several successful charity shops that have raised much money for the trust, which has enabled it to do more than it would have otherwise have been able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having acquired a block of flats that also had shops, if an association decided to run one of the shops as its own charity shop not for a limited period, but indefinitely, would such action be in breach of the Bill? I suspect that it might. We tabled the amendment to avoid that risk; it is designed to cover circumstances that are ancillary to the main functions. I hope that the Government will not oppose the measure. We are not suggesting that social housing landlords should run businesses. We are talking about incidental circumstances. We are concerned about the way in which the Bill is drafted and I hope that the Minister will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just received a message, but nonetheless, I will say what I was about to say. The hon. Gentlemen's explanation has clarified the purpose of the amendment. Nothing prevents people from acquiring a block of flats, which contains a chippy or a launderette, but they should not operate a commercial business. After a reasonable time, they can dispose of it or appoint someone to run it. They can own the property, but not operate businesses because that is not their central purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if the landlord was a charitable organisation. My initial response is that an association could establish a subsidiary to run such an activity. However, if the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment, I shall reflect upon the matter in the light of what he has said, with a view of finding a definition that would meet his worries about activities of a charitable nature and my concern that we do not want charities to become accidentally involved in commercial activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the rather more fundamental question of the composition of the boards of social housing landlords. That is a matter of real concern to local authorities that are considering setting up local housing companies, and to tenants, who rightly wish to play a role in the management of their housing and who want to have some say in how their landlord operates. The amendment is most relevant in the context of local housing companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing companies are often seen as an attractive option for increasing investment and securing a more focused attention on the improvement or replacement of substandard housing and areas with serious problems. I first advocated the creation of local housing companies five years ago. I am pleased that the Government have eventually caught up and are giving the concept
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
legislative effect in the Bill. Although the concept is attractive, important practical considerations must be met if local housing companies are to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local housing companies must be established in a way that gives real confidence to the tenants and to the councils that establish them. The evidence shows that tenants will not vote for an organisation to take over their homes if it is likely to act like a private landlord. Part VIII of the Bill includes the repeal of the tenants' choice scheme introduced by the late Lord Ridley in the Housing Act 1988. The fact that that scheme is being repealed is eloquent testimony to the Government's failure to impose their will on tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Ridley believed that the tenants' choice scheme would enable tenants to vote in large numbers for private landlords, whom they would find an attractive alternative to the local council. The reality was entirely different. Tenants throughout the country made it clear that they did not want private landlords running their homes. Only in Conservative Westminster, where the council's antics are sadly too well known, did a significant number of tenants want to transfer to another landlord because they had had enough of the council. That is the only area where a significant number of people voted to take advantage of the tenants' choice scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lesson in that and I hope that Ministers will take it. Local housing companies will not succeed if tenants see them as an attempt at privatisation. They will succeed only if tenants are satisfied that the companies are set up in a way that takes account of their concerns, guarantees, their interests and ensures that they continue to operate as was originally anticipated. Several factors have to be dealt with to give tenants those assurances. We focus on only one of them in the amendment. We shall return to the others later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The composition of the local housing company's board is crucial. The amendment would provide a framework in which there would be no absolute prohibition either on tenants having a certain proportion of representatives on the company's board or on limiting the local authority to 20 per cent, of the membership. I shall deal with the reason for the 20 per cent, limit in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the amendment would not prescribe a certain proportion of local authority or tenant representatives on any board. That would be wrong. The arrangements must be made locally in the light of local circumstances, and there should be flexibility. There should be a framework in which tenants could have a majority interest on the board or a majority shareholding, or in which a council could have more than 20 per cent, representation on the board. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the reason for the amendment. We do not suggest that all, or indeed the majority, of local housing companies will have majority tenant representation. We suspect that that will happen only occasionally. In Glasgow, there have been some extremely successful initiatives for the creation of co-operative housing associations, which have taken over some of the city council's former housing stock and have run it well. They are tenant-controlled bodies; tenants are in a majority. There is no reason why that successful experiment should not be replicated elsewhere. Such arrangements should not be prohibited, nor should they be a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Of course, if such a body is to be successful it will have to convince the lenders that it has not only a robust business plan but an effective management who can ensure that it meets its objectives. No lender would advance money to such an organisation without being confident about its business plan and the calibre of its management. The fact that there is a majority of tenants in the management should not preclude it from being considered. That is the purpose of amendment No. 77.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 78 deals with local authority representation. Again, we are saying not that there should be a fixed proportion of local authority representatives on the board of a local housing company but that the proportion should not be arbitrarily restricted to less than 20 per cent. We accept that the proportion will be restricted by definition to less than 50 per cent, if the local housing company is not to come within the capital controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a grey area between the 20 per cent, figure, which is laid down in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, and the 50 per cent, figure, which is clearly necessary to meet public expenditure conditions. The local housing companies should have discretion to accept arrangements under which local authorities have representation of more than 20 per cent, if they so wish. They should not be precluded from doing so by the wording of the 1989 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that he is willing to be flexible. I hope that he will accept the amendment because it would provide flexibility and it would not be prescriptive. I hope that the Minister will not argue that the amendment is technically deficient. In case he does so, I remind him that the wording of the amendment has been taken verbatim from the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. So, if it is defective, it is because the Government's legislation is defective. The amendment's purpose is modest and clear, and I hope that the Minister finds it acceptable. I look forward to him being even more responsive than he was in the previous debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a problem with half of the amendment. I should make it clear that we have no intention of applying a 20 per cent, threshold to local authorities. The criteria that we have adopted are deliberately loose. We are agreed that the housing company must be in the private sector; nor must anyone have a dominant share in that company. However, a dominant share depends on how many people and in what way they hold the remaining shares. If one shareholder had 49 per cent, and 51 shareholders had 1 per cent., clearly the one with 49 per cent, of the shares would be a dominant shareholder. However, that would not be true if a shareholder had 30 per cent, and everyone else had fragmented shares. If a local authority had 40 per cent., the tenants had 20 or 25 per cent, and other stakeholders held significant blocks, clearly 40 per cent, would not be a dominant share. The Housing Corporation must consider each case as it comes—in other words, suck it and see. We have deliberately been flexible in that regard, so 20 per cent, has no merit in the world of the housing companies that we envisage. The amendment would permit the Housing Corporation to impose a 21 per cent, limit, but we agree that that is not what was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the tenant's majority, I have two problems that I should explain. I accept that tenants should play a significant role and I do not exclude the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
possibility that perhaps they could be the major single group of shareholders in a company. That is a possibility, although our experience is that, by and large, tenants want to be consulted rather than to manage. I am often told by them that they want effective consultation and are rather less anxious to get into the full business of management, but is not just a question of predilection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing companies could well be large organisations with complex finances which have to raise money on the markets. Small co-operatives which raise domestic mortgage finance and tenant management organisations that are responsible for day-to-day management have a good record. I acknowledge that, but for transfers there is a vital additional ingredient. The transfer landlords, who will be the biggest group of new registrations, will have a heavy burden of debt. In the early years, the management of that burden will be crucial. We must be satisfied that the boards will use their expertise and experience to enable them to deal with those responsibilities. It may be that we can revisit that concern when housing companies develop over time, but at present, I am worried about the idea of a tenant majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second concern—it is not financial but almost social—is that social housing is not there just for those who happen to be occupying it at present. Their needs, wishes and views are important, but others have a legitimate interest too. The local authority, which may have allocation rights to that social housing, those who provide the funding and those who may want social housing in the future, all have an interest. We must ensure that those who are inside cannot pull up a drawbridge against those who may want to come into the structure in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Greenwich and I do not think that we are very far apart. I have an immediate concern, which leads me to resist his amendment, but I do not exclude revisiting the topic when housing companies have gained some track record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried because I do not think that I declared an interest on Tuesday. I have a share in the London and Quadrant housing association. I resigned my post because parliamentary business took up too much of my time, but I spent a pleasant time in that association. What was so good about it was the diversity of the management and the way in which it went to great lengths to ensure that members of the governing board not only had an interest in housing, but came from diverse backgrounds. It was an extremely non-political organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry about organisations such as the London and Quadrant housing association that are becoming so large. They should be broken up, as small associations are better than big, monolithic organisations, which have the same problems as local authorities, in that management is difficult and often bad. I have much experience of that, and I cannot think of any instance when I felt that management was of such a calibre that it should be retained. Management is always much better when it is brought down to a local level, such as happens more and more in housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
What does concern me, which is different from my experience of the London and Quadrant housing association, is what sometimes occurs where there is a smaller housing association in an area that has traditionally been under the control of a single political party, usually the Labour party. Housing associations tend to be built up out of the Labour party, and are connected with a family or section of the party. People cease to be active members of the party, go into the housing association and draw a wage of £25,000 and £30,000 to manage areas, but the association becomes closely attached to the local authority. The local authority allows the land to be used and provides money to the association, which then becomes an arm of the local Labour party. That worries me, as it leads down a path that is contrary to the interests of tenants, good management, the housing association sector and the social sector generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry about local authorities' having nomination rights to association boards and having too much input to local housing associations which do not have enough independence and often make bad decisions. I have seen housing associations running their property as badly as the worst local authority property has been managed. Management seems to emanate from the same source—the people who manage associations are the same as those who used to manage local authority housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would provide nomination rights, and that worries me. Housing associations will develop when the governorship is in the hands of people who are independent and who have business experience. There is nothing special about housing; it gives rise to general management problems, of which many people have experience. We should ensure that more people with business experience are brought in, rather than people whose experience is purely political and of local authority housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We worry too much about tenants being represented. If local housing associations are run by people who have a knowledge of good management, the tenants will be happy. What tenants want is well-managed property, which is maintained and has a reserve for maintenance. They want a firm policy—we shall discuss that later—that enables them to live in their homes without worrying about neighbours who will make their lives a misery. They want to know that their homes belong to an association that is not running at a loss, so that it can maintain properties properly. They want associations to include people who are sympathetic, who understand their problems and the needs of the neighbourhood and area. I do not share the great belief that local authorities are the be-all and end-all and that they require nomination rights to run the properties. After all, they have nomination rights in respect of housing itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

community are elected to the boards of housing associations for their business acumen. They are there for the benefit of the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is misguided. He has limited knowledge of what happens in areas where social housing is important and where tenants are involved in their own destinies and the way in which housing associations operate. He should consider what is happening in social housing. Although he referred to Labour-controlled local authorities, he must have meant Westminster local authority. The hon. Gentleman was certainly not describing the housing authority in which I have been involved—the Wakefield metropolitan district housing authority. The Government regard that authority as efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such members of local housing organisations have experience and know how to administer housing. Housing management is significant. Members do not deal simply with the letting of houses or collecting rents. Without tenants participating in the local housing companies, there would not be good housing management. The properties should be well-managed. The boards should comprise tenants and those who have an interest in housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want people nominated to local housing organisations who have the same views as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire. There is no hope for local housing companies if the boards are to be made up of such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give careful consideration to the amendment. The composition of the boards of social housing companies must allow tenants' voices to be heard in any decision-making process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify a point for the hon. Gentleman. The only question is whether tenant majorities should be permitted. I take the view that no single group should form the majority. I have no objection to tenants holding a significant minority stake, just as the local authority, the housing association or independent members might hold a minority stake. So tenant involvement is not an issue. The only issue that divides us is whether they should be permitted to hold a majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Ministers intervention, which helps us to understand what the Government have in mind. I have my suspicions, however. I was a member of the Committee that considered the Housing Bill in 1988. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich mentioned, we debated the voting rights of tenants. We pleaded with the Government not to pursue their proposal as it was not in the best interests of tenants, but to no avail. History shows that we were right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should not deny tenants the opportunity to have a significant say in the operation of local housing companies. They are the people who will live in the houses, their rents will provide the resources and they should have a substantial involvement in the new companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the attention of the Minister and the Committee what happens in my area, where the Chantry housing association is working with the Wakefield metropolitan district housing authority to provide housing by taking over empty properties in the area and offering accommodation to people on the waiting list. That programme should be studied, as it shows what can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
achieved by a tripartite arrangement involving tenants, local authorities and housing associations. It is a programme of regeneration and improvement, in which tenants' views are taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee would be wise to accept the amendment, in view of our experience of housing matters and the way that housing companies are to be run. I appeal to the Minister to consider my hon. Friends argument and to allow tenants to have a major say in the management of local housing companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment because it goes in the right direction. There has been quite a lot of consensus this morning, but I disagree with some aspects—notably with the role of local housing companies. I do not object to them in principle but, unlike the hon. Member for Greenwich and the Minister, I do not believe that we should be absolute slaves to the public sector borrowing requirement. The setting up of local housing companies is another way of allowing people to get hold of money; it should be much feared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should local authorities have to jump through elaborate and bureaucratic hoops before investing in social housing? Everyone is aware of the need to keep public sector borrowing under control, but we must recognise the difference between good and bad investments. We must differentiate between borrowing capital for long-term investment and borrowing to bail out revenue accounts, which we do not support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of tenants and local authorities in social housing is important. Some parts of the Bill show that the Government agree with that view. However, I disagree strongly with the view of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire about the involvement of tenants. I hope that the Government also disagree. In his speech, the hon. Gentleman negated everything that the Government have said over the years—even about the disaster of the tenants choice scheme, which has quietly hit the dust. Dare I use the word "stakeholder"? Tenants are stakeholders in their communities: they pay rents and are part of their communities. It is often said that people should take responsibility for their own lives. It is also said that people should care about their community. If the role of tenants can be so lightly dismissed, the government will not be able to achieve their other objective of developing sustainable communities. Too many groups feel alienated. I hope that the Government's view is rather different from that of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady misunderstands me. We are talking about housing associations. How can tenants be represented on the boards of organisations as large as the London and Quadrant, which has hundreds of properties? We are talking not about management committees, but housing associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What worries me is the assertion that tenants need not be involved. I understand what the hon. Gentleman said, but tenants' views are crucial. Housing associations that cover a wide area will find it difficult to involve tenants. One of the strengths of local authority housing is that the tenants all live in the same area. It is vital that tenants are involved in the running of their estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
Liberal Democrat councils have enabled tenants to take part at every level. We have investigated imaginative schemes elsewhere, particularly in Denmark. Many of the decisions pushed through by the Government have been based on the fact that some local authorities have been badly run—and the Labour party may have some responsibility for that. However, we must not forget the good local authorities that have well-run housing schemes, that have worked and are working now with housing associations to provide social housing. We must not use what has happened in some local authorities as a justification for making blanket changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Greenwich and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) have been kind enough to try to make me feel at home by referring to Westminster city council, which may well be mentioned again during our proceedings. I should make it clear that, casting the Opposition as the angler and myself as the fly, I shall not feel obliged on every subsequent occasion to comment on the particular matters that have been mentioned today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same spirit of amity, I remind the hon. Member for Normanton—he knows this from an event that we attended in Wakefield—that my great-great-uncle served as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Wakefield. I should tell the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) that, when he arrived in the House, he decided that he greatly preferred Mr. Disraeli to Mr. Gladstone, and resigned at the following general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first sitting of the Committee at which I have been present, Mrs. Winterton, and I, too, welcome you to the Chair. Listening to the exchanges between the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, who leads for the Opposition, I was pleasantly surprised at the absence of party-political dogma. There is a concern from all parties with what should be central to all our debates, namely the best way to supply and manage social housing, for which there is a desperate need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, however, extremely disappointed when the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire introduced a party-political angle to our deliberations. It is extraordinary that he should castigate all local authorities, although I know that his party has lost control of the majority of them. It is quite wrong to dub all local authorities and councillors uncaring or incompetent, or say that they have only political interests and experience. Local councillors are at the sharp end. They know what are the realities of social housing for the people whom they represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the tenants of social housing are listened to. The majority of letters in my constituency postbag come from tenants in the private sector, who justifiably wail about the mismanagement of their blocks by people who present themselves as professional managers of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Tenants often have a more precise perspective of what will enhance their lives than do those who believe that they are improving the lives of the tenants. For example, there is in my constituency a small development of social housing that is occupied mainly by elderly people, some of whom are physically disabled. Someone—I do not know whom—thought mat it would be nice if the hard standing immediately in front of the block were improved and planted with perennial shrubs and small trees. When the tenants were asked what they thought about the idea, their overriding concern was that small trees and perennial shrubs could become hiding places for muggers and that crime could be facilitated on their small estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, therefore, always be sensitive to the particular needs of tenants in specific parts of the social housing sector. I hope that the Minister will think again about how strongly tenants' voices will be heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall spell out our position, as there are only a couple of percentage points between us. My view is simple. I do not believe that any single interest group should have control of the housing company. That applies whether the interest group is the local authority, a housing association or, for that matter, the Abbey National, Nationwide, Quality Street or Johnson Fry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That principle is not directed against tenants, but I do not believe that there should be one controlling interst group. Social housing exists to fulfil a purpose that goes beyond the immediate aim of satisfying the tenants who live in it at one particular time. Shareholders may want to take on new risks by bidding for funds to develop new housing or to receive transfers. It is important that there should be a balance, but there is nothing to prevent tenants playing a major role and being one of the significant share-holding groups. Indeed, I would encourage them to do so, as it has been demonstrated to work. I am not hostile to tenants; I simply believe that share-holding should be balanced, and there should be no single dominant group, irrespective of which group that might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's position is untenable. Behind him in his party he has the authentic Conservative voice opposed to tenant participation and to local councils having a say in local housing companies, and eager to stuff the boards with more business cronies. That is what he heard from the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition presented an entirely reasonable and plausible case for allowing flexibility, yet the Minister is still cavilling. Presumably, he is still in hock to his hon. Friends on the Back Benches, who have antiquated views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister believe that the Secretary of State for Scotland was wrong to allow the Scottish housing co-operatives to take over Glasgow city council's housing stock with tenant majorities? If not, how can it be inappropriate to allow something similar to happen in England, unless he believes that Scotland should be given more favoured treatment than England? I cannot believe that a Minister in the present Government would argue that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister believe that it was wrong for the Walterton and Elgin community housing association to take over housing from Westminster city council? The right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) alluded to his borough
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
in this context. That housing association is tenant-controlled and it acted under the tenants choice scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those cases in Glasgow and Westminster existing council property was transferred and a significant debt was involved. Those two points were used by the Minister to justify his opposition to majority tenant participation. His case is not valid, unless he is prepared to tell us that what happened in Scotland and Westminster was wrong, and that the Government have now decided to pursue a different policy because they made a mistake in those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for council representation, the Minister will be aware that section 69 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 remains on the statute book. As far as I know, there are no plans to repeal it. If there are such plans, I shall be happy to give way to the Minister. Although he says that the figure of 20 per cent, will not be rigidly imposed, the 1989 Act remains on the statute book and there could be a serious problem, particularly if he is offering us no more than ministerial guidance, or possibly an order, which would not stand up against legislation that states that where council representation is more than 20 per cent, that is a company influenced by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes sense to clarify the position, as our amendments seek to do. Unless the Minister can give us a plausible response, unlike that which he has offered so far, I shall have no hesitation in asking my colleagues to vote in favour of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 3, line 16, leave out from "Corporation" to "shall" in line 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a brief amendment. It would remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"may register as a social landlord any body which is eligible for such registration, but the Corporation"</p></blockquote>
from the first two lines of subsection (1). As anyone who has carefully studied the clause will know—I am sure that all hon. Members have done so—there is a tension between subsection (1) and subsection (2). The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation may register as a social landlord any body which is eligible"</p></blockquote>
but it continues that the corporation has to establish criteria, which the body must satisfy before being registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how the two can be compatible. Either the corporation must register any organisation that is eligible, or it must establish criteria and then register the bodies that satisfy that criteria, but it cannot do both. The amendment would bring clarity in place of confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in a deep cloud about what the amendment was meant to achieve, but there are now one or two shafts of light piercing it—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I could be much nastier if the Committee prefers, but I thought that we had established a rather agreeable tone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would delete some key words from the clause—those that give the Housing Corporation the power to register any body that meets the eligibility test in clause 2. That would leave the corporation with a duty under clause 1 to maintain the register and to establish criteria for registration under clause 3, but without the power to register any body in the first place, which makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
The point at issue is how the corporation will exercise the discretion under clause 3 to register any body that is eligible. The corporation will be required to act reasonably in using its discretion under the general requirements of administrative law and good practice. The clause goes further and spells out that the corporation must establish criteria for registration and then use those criteria in deciding whether to register an applicant. That will ensure that its decisions are intelligible and open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot remove the need for judgment altogether. Whatever criteria are adopted, an application will require judgment as to whether the organisation has fit and proper people running it or adequate financial expertise. It is not possible simply to say that any organisation that thinks it meets certain criteria must be registered. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the clause works as it stands and offers a clear framework within which the corporation can use its judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman has detected a technical problem, which I have not, I am perfectly willing to discuss that with him and table an amendment to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's comment that again he is willing to discuss the matter and table an amendment if necessary. It is helpful to speed the Committee along but is it always in the best interests of the Bill? It could mean that many amendments will be tabled on Report. As we proceed with the Bill, it would help if the Minister could table amendments at the same time as Opposition amendments, rather than waiting for the Report stage. I suggest to the Minister that he could be considering amendments to clauses 15 and 16 and the use of statutory instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will continue to be helpful and trey to table amendments during the Committee stage rather than on Report, which is often compressed. Political issues need to have a full debate in the House, but there is not always an opportunity to do so on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Often, in discussion, one discovers an issue that has not been detected in the initial reading of an amendment. In that case, I always want to see whether a real problem exists. The alternative is simply to advise my colleagues to resist an amendment and vote it down, which is not the best way to proceed. When technical points are coming up, I try to give advance notice to members of the Committee, including you, Mrs. Winterton, to try to explain them and facilitate the way the Committee works. I shall continue to do that. If Opposition Members discover problems about which they can give advance notice, that would be helpful. We must argue about issues of principle, but if Opposition Members draw my attention to technical snags, I shall certainly consider them and, if necessary, table appropriate amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously did not express my argument with appropriate clarity. We do not wish to prevent the corporation from registering social housing landlords. We support such a power. However, given the way in which the clause is drafted, tension might arise between the first phrase, which states that the corporation
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
may register any body that is eligible, and the second provision, under which it must draw up criteria and assess people against those criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may not be a problem, but some bodies may feel that they were eligible for registration and aggrieved by the decision not to register them. They could challenge the corporation on the basis that it had power to register any body that was eligible. To avoid that happening, the position needs to be clarified. That is the purpose of our amendment. I happily accept the Minister's undertaking to consider the matter further and, with that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that I can deal briefly with that amendment.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest anyone should feel that the large number of amendments means that we shall have a long debate, I should say that that will not be so. The principle behind the amendments is consultation. The reason why there are so many references is that the Housing Corporation, in exercising its functions under this part of the Bill, should consult interest groups before reaching a decision. Various stages are involved of which the most important are: before establishing criteria for registering social landlords; when considering applications for registration; when considering removing associations or social housing landlords from the register; and when considering transferring properties from one social landlord to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation will be appropriate at each of those stages but who should be consulted? We do not advocate a massive and bureaucratic procedure in which everyone has to be consulted, but legitimate interest groups whose opinions can be helpful should be taken into account before key decisions are taken. For example, representatives of local authorities will have considerable experience on a large range of issues relating to the need for housing and the appropriateness or otherwise of bodies which seek to become social landlords. Local authorities will have a valuable perspective on the needs of their own area and on the performance of social housing landlords. Groups representative of social landlords—particularly the National Federation of Housing Associations, which as provided much useful information to members of the Committee, as have local authorities associations—have been extremely helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certain words run through this series of amendments. For instance, amendment No. 16 includes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall consult such bodies appearing to it to be representative".</p></blockquote>
If a housing association has to consult all such bodies, it will spend its entire time consulting and never get on with its job, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman would wish it to do. A decision to consult no one would be open to judicial review, but under the amendments almost everyone would have the right to be consulted. Housing associations could not function like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing two organisations. He referred to housing associations, but the amendment would impose a duty on the Housing Corporation. The amendments have been carefully worded, and state that the corporation should consult with bodies that appear to it to be representative. There is therefore no right to representation and no right to be consulted. The requirement is that the corporation should consult with bodies that it considers to be representative. There is no question of the smallest housing association
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
in an obscure part of the hon. Gentleman's constituency insisting on the right to be consulted about matters entirely outside its area of interest. We simply seek to create a climate in which the Housing Corporation can shake off its image as remote, inaccessible, and insensitive to the views of local communities. We wish to make it more responsive. We are trying to create a culture of responsiveness, and to ensure good quality social housing, produced by people who really understand the needs of die areas in which they operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stressed in my earlier remarks that we did not want to create a bureaucratic nightmare in which everyone had to be consulted. The amendments have been purposely framed to avoid that. However, the principle of consultation is important. The views of local authority association, representatives of social landlords and tenants, and of others who are likely to have a significant point to bring to bear on relevant issues; such as professional associations, should be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not denigrate the process of consultation—the Housing Corporation should consult—the amendments need to be more tightly drawn and specify exactly what types of bodies ought to be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is shifting his ground by arguing that we should draw tighter definitions of the duty to consult. Amendment No. 16, which he quoted, states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Corporation shall consult such bodies appearing to it to be representative of registered social landlords."</p></blockquote>
We are talking about the establishment of criteria for the registration of social landlords. The concept that the corporation should do that without bothering to consult anyone is ridiculous. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that, before establishing criteria, there should at least be an opportunity for bodies such as the NFHA to express their views. I should be astonished if he objected to that principle. If he does not, I challenge him to find a wording that would express more tightly the requirement without imposing any scope for aggrieved bodies to challenge it. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to this huge raft of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give everyone at least some modest pleasure. I am prepared to accept in principle the amendments that would require the corporation to consult various representative bodies on general criteria. Those amendments are Nos. 13, 63, 16, 65, 17 and 79. I am advised that they need tidying up and could be presented more neatly; for example, we could roll up amendments Nos. 13 and 63 together. I shall table amendments to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also think it right that local authorities should have a chance to be consulted before the corporation deregisters a landlord, as proposed in amendment No. 66. I am prepared to table an amendment to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot, however, accept the other amendments. Amendments No. 64 would require consultation with local authorities on whether to register a landlord. If a landlord meets the corporation's criteria, and the corporation has consulted widely about those criteria, why should further consultation be necessary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
Amendment No. 89 poses a real problem. It relates to the exemption of some rural areas from purchase grant schemes. I have written to the Committee explaining our approach to such designation. We shall be consulting on that shortly, but if we were to include the requirement in the Bill we would have to go through the consultation exercise again, which would be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 67, 68 and 35 are about consulting when the corporation proposes to transfer land or assets on dissolution or wind-up of a landlord, or after an inquiry. I appreciate that people's homes are at stake and that it is a sensitive matter, but the corporation has the task of finding a new landlord who is able and willing to take on the housing. There may not be many options available in the short time scale necessary. I do not want consultation to raise expectations that there is a choice, as that may not be realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 104 and 106 would require the corporation to consult a wide range of bodies about performance standards for landlords and then consult them again on the information that it collected to check whether the landlords were meeting those standards. If we cannot trust the corporation to ask the right people for advice and collect the right information to do the job, there is a problem, which will not be solved by going around the course again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Member for Greenwich to meet me half way. I am willing to table Government amendments that will have the same effects as amendments Nos. 13, 63, 16, 65, 66, 17 and 79.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is welcome news. As has been said, concerns have been expressed about how the corporation has developed and how it operates. The amendments would given greater transparency to the corporation's work and satisfy many of the criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been increasing recognition of the role of local authorities. Different parties come to that recognition from different angles, but we all agree that local authorities have an enabling role, and must be key players in consultations on the provision of social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that local authority associations should be included. Earlier speeches have emphasised why that is important. People often judge the way in which local authorities operate by the misdeeds of some authorities. Local authority associations can give a wider view across the spectrum. I understand the Minister's opinion of amendment No. 67, but I am disappointed that he is not prepared to accept it. Tenants are important and, if their landlord is to change, it is of crucial interest to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not been able to calculate precisely whether the Minister has met us exactly halfway, but given the number of amendments debated and the number agreed to, we are nearly there, so I shall not split hairs about this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one worry. On Tuesday, I drew attention to the interesting article in 
	<i>Inside Housing</i> which gave a biographical picture of the Minister. I did not mention all that it said; I thought that I would leave a few nuggets for later use. The article contains one especially interesting statement, which is that the Minister
	<br><blockquote><p>"is said to have a 'love-hate relationship' with civil servants."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
I am not sure what that means. However, I am slightly worried that the Minister has accepted a commitment to return to so many amendments that his civil servants will be in hate mode, rather than love mode, because of the amount of work in which they will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are delighted with the concessions on more effective consultation; they will improve the Bill. We could argue about some of the amendments that he was not prepared to accept. However, to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REMOVAL FROM THE REGISTER</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 4, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(d) to the local housing authorities in whose areas the body provided or managed housing immediately prior to its removal from the register.'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that this amendment—on notification, rather than consultation—can be dealt with rapidly. Clause 4 deals with circumstances in which organisations will be removed from the register if they act in a way which is counter to the purposes of social housing landlords. There is a requirement that the corporation must give notice to various organisations if it decides to remove a body from the register. The clause states that notice must be given only,

	<ol>

	<li>in the case of a registered charity, to the Charity Commissioners,</li>

	<li>in the case of an industrial and provident society, to the appropriate registrar, and</li>

	<li>in the case of a company registered under the Companies Act 1985 … to the registrar of companies."</li></ol>
The amendment would add to that list
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local housing authorities in whose areas the body provided or managed housing immediately prior to its removal from the register."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, the purpose of that is to ensure that local housing authorities are aware of the decision and can take appropriate action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfortunate if they continued to negotiate with such bodies as possible partners in developments unaware that the Housing Corporation had decided to remove them from the register. In the interests of good administration, the Housing Corporation will want to notify local authorities, but it seemed sensible to ensure that it could not neglect to do so. Therefore, this sensible and practical amendment would improve the Bill. I hope that the Minister will have no difficulty accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment concerns the procedures under which the Housing Corporation may appoint directors to a social housing landlord where it considers that necessary. Usually the procedures apply where there has been a problem with the association or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
it is necessary to strengthen the board. The procedure is appropriate, but we believe that the way in which it is exercised should be circumscribed with suitable safeguards. The amendment would limit appointments to an initial 12-month period, which can be extended for a further 12 months, with the requirement that there should be a review at the end of the first period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A housing association is a voluntary organisation. Where someone who has not been chosen by the association's membership or committee is imposed on it by an outside body, there should be a safeguard to ensure that that is for a limited period. The amendment would provide that safeguard. It should not be a problem for the corporation to comply with such a requirement. I hope that the Minister will therefore accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some difficulty with the amendment. People appointed to deal with a problem in a body managing social housing are unpaid appointments. It would be sensible not to include a restrictive arrangement in the Bill. The corporation needs to use the benefits of its experience to consider the circumstances of the case. As the appointments are unpaid, we must ensure that able people are willing to undertake the tasks and that they can deliver the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also restrict the appointment of a director or trustee to a maximum period of two years. It would be inefficient for the corporation to appoint a new person, if a problem were still to be resolved. The amendments are impractical. Does the hon. Gentleman really wish to proceed with them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled by the Minister's response to the amendment. The main thrust of his argument seems to be that, because the people are unpaid, no restriction should be imposed on them. Surely, if people were given such an onerous task without pay, they would probably welcome the restriction of a maximum period of 12 months. Be that as it may, it is clear that the Minister will not be as accommodating as he has been previously. To avoid further delay, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to when the Housing Corporation exercises its powers to appoint a new director or trustee to a registered charity. It is right that such appointees should come from a register of suitable people, which is open to public scrutiny. It is not right for such appointments, made by a quango to the boards of charitable organisations, to be entirely at the say-so of the board or senior officials of the Housing Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is about transparency in the process of government. There should be a panel of people from whom the corporation may select whomever it considers appropriate in the individual circumstances when it wants to appoint a trustee to the board. It is important to maintain transparency and some accountability in that process. Having had experience of such powers for many years, I know that the voluntary housing movements suspects that the corporation chooses people to be appointed for certain functions for no apparent reason other than that they have some connection with the Housing Corporation. There may be good reasons for such appointments or, there may not, but the world does not know; the operation is closed. In the interests of open government and transparency—a principle that the Minister was happy to accept earlier—I hope that he will agree with the spirit of the amendment. I have no doubt, however, that he will find something technically wrong with it so that he can return with an alternative amendment rather than accept ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some difficulties with the amendment. It is not necessary. The occasions when people might need to be appointed differ throughout the country. There might be some places where no one needs to be sent in, as it were, for years, while other parts of the country may have a more frequent need for such appointments. The Housing Corporation must be able to choose the expertise that is necessary and appropriate in different circumstances. The amendment would not, add anything to the Bill. I invite the hon. Gentleman not to persist with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister completely discounts the amendment, is there not a danger that the most able people, who tend in the main, to be backward in pushing themselves forward in such circumstances will be ignored consistently? That has been my experience of what happens in other organisations. Commitment to the community and dedication to charitable work mean that people who should be given a higher profile in those sectors tend to be overlooked. Even though my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich withdrew amendment No. 18, I believe that always to preclude selection from a particular area or over time will mean that the opportunity to encourage others to enter different fields will be lost. I hope that the Minister will further consider what is suggested in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Lady's arguments, but I believe that they work in the opposite direction. People who are active in the community but are reticent and do not push themselves forward might be reluctant to be enrolled on a formal panel. There is a practical solution. The Housing Corporation is bound to consult people who are active locally about their availability, appropriateness and willingness to serve. I shall suggest to the corporation that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
it conducts a full shuffle of people who are available and have the right expertise. Such informal working is better than the imposition of rules, as proposed in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a certain contradiction at the heart of the Ministers argument. The NFHA recently conducted an important inquiry into the governance of housing associations. It made a series of recommendations to improve the process of the appointment of members of association boards, focusing on appropriate selection procedures and greater openness. It would be curious if the Housing Corporation continued to operate behind a veil of secrecy when making appointments to the boards of associations and other social landlords, while the housing association movement is being encouraged, not least by the corporation, to be more open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will talk seriously to the corporation about that and push it along the route that the NFHA has recommended for housing associations. Provided that he is happy to do that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to our proceedings to date, any betting person would undoubtedly be running a book to the likelihood of the Minister agreeing to accept the principle of the amendment. I hope that the odds are in favour rather than against this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will not accept the words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, the Minister will not accept the words, but let us hope that he will accept the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is straightforward. We are talking about a social housing landlord or housing association being wound up, whose assets must be transferred to another social housing landlord. That is a process that the Housing Corporation, as the regulator of the housing association movement, has the right to undertake. The question is whether all the assets should be transferred to one or more than one other social housing landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire—his constituency is a tongue-twister: he must have great difficulty with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps his constituents have—or at least, they do with him, but let us not pursue that. He expressed concern about the size of housing associations and he said small was beautiful. If a largish body was dissolved and its assets were all transferred to one other body, that would greatly increase the size of the receiving body. There may be circumstances when that is appropriate because of a geographical split. A social housing landlord may own properties in a number of different areas, but the transfer should be not to a single, alternative landlord. It should be to a number of different ones with stockholdings in the respective areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is simply to allow transfer to one or more specified registered social landlords instead of all to one. It is a common sense principle, which I should have thought that the Minister would accept, but no doubt he will find the wording defective so that he can suggest an alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our deliberations, it may be that the Opposition will table one amendment that I can accept in its entirety. Perhaps we can work on that so that we can accept one celebrated Opposition amendment.

This group does not include one of those, although the principle gives me no problem. We shall be tabling amendments for the same purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say that it is quite difficult to see how else the concept can be expressed other than in the words "one or more". However, I look forward to seeing the fruits of the ingenuity of the civil servants who will, if the analysis of 
	<i>Inside Housing</i> is right, have even more reason not to love their Minister. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 72 and 76 and the following amendments: No. 94, in clause 23, page 14, line 40, leave out '17 (social housing grant)' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'41 of the Housing Associations Act 1985 or any enactment replaced by that section'.</p></blockquote>
No. 95, in clause 23, page 15, line 11, leave out '17' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"41 of the 1985 Act or any enactment replaced by that section".</p></blockquote>
No. 96, in clause 25, page 16, line 5, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) The Secretary of State may delegate to the Housing Corporation, to such extent and subject to such conditions as he may specify, any of his functions under sections 23 to 25, and, where he does so, references to him in these sections shall be construed accordingly.'.</p></blockquote>
As amendments Nos. 71, 72 and 76 tabled by the Government deal with the removal from the schedule of matters referred to in clauses 23 to 25, which the Government intend not to move Opposition amendments Nos. 94, 95 and 96 have been grouped with them, although they relate to the aforementioned clauses. In debating this group of amendments, therefore, it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
intended that the merits of clauses 23 to 25 be debated. When those clauses are reached, the questions thereon will be put forthwith. I hope that that makes it clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clauses 23 to 25, the Housing Corporation can require registered landlords to establish accounts showing surpluses arising from rent income on housing built with new social housing grant; and it can recover those surpluses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clauses replicate section 55 of the Housing Act 1988, which applies similar provisions to housing built with housing association grant. In practice, section 55 is applied only to housing built before the 1988 Act was passed. It is not applied to stock built with a high proportion of private finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no intention of changing that policy now, so the provisions in clauses 23 to 25 that would apply to new stock are unnecessary. I have agreed that they should be removed. Amendments have been tabled to achieve that, but they wold not have been debated until we reached clause 23—except that you, Mrs. Winterton, have just ruled to the contrary. The removal of those clauses requires consequential amendments—Government amendments Nos. 71, 72 and 76—to be made to schedule 1 and clause 61. I hope that those amendments make it unnecessary for the hon. Gentleman to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard an interesting and revealing admission. The Bill was introduced only three weeks ago. We have already heard of the Government's intention to withdraw clauses 23 to 25. A raft of Government amendments tabled only last week have since been withdrawn. I have to ask whether the Government know what they are doing. They publish legislation, yet within days they have to amend it. They table amendments that mysteriously disappear as a result of hasty letters from the National Federation of Housing Associations, saying a few rude things about the Government's proposals. That is an extraordinary admission of incompetence. That is no way to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More careful consideration should have been given to the Bill, but it has been cobbled together in a hurry, then cobbled apart in a hurry. Not it is being hacked apart at a slightly more leisurely pace, with the benefit of our observations. As I said earlier, had the Minister discussed those matters with us earlier, we could have saved him and his officials a great deal of unnecessary work, However, the Government have seen some of the errors of their ways. We have no objection to the withdrawal of those clauses or to what the Minister proposes. However, we note what has happened; it is not the most glorious episode in the Minister's career or the Government's history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the Minister can have made this sound so matter of fact. He got it wrong; he has had to change his mind. Concern was expressed on Second Reading about how the Bill was put together. It is the first Housing Bill for some time. We have known for some time that one was coming; indeed, we expected it a few weeks earlier. We all heard the rumours, and the Minister's statement this morning has confirmed those rumours to be true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman reminds us how better the Bill would have been if the Minister had consulted him in private, before the Bill came to Committee. I speak only for myself, but I believe that the hon. Gentleman underestimates the pleasure that we take in hearing him speak in Committee. Had he followed the course that he suggested, we should have been deprived of that pleasure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 57.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my final sally this morning in my efforts to improve the Bill with sensible and practical amendments. The amendment deals with the appointment by the corporation of people to conduct inquiries into the activity of social housing landlords. That power exists, but must be changed in accordance with the wider remit of the corporation that is established under the Bill. That provides an opportunity to rectify problems that arise from the existing procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the corporation must appoint one independent person to conduct an inquiry. That may be a little inflexible. We accept the need to widen the scope, as it may be appropriate to appoint one or more people, but it would be wrong if there were a monopoly of Housing Corporation employees on the inquiry. We therefore propose that the corporation
	<br><blockquote><p>'shall appoint one or more persons to conduct the inquiry at least one of which shall not be an employee of the Corporation, nor shall have been for the last five years.'</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
That would retain the principle of independence that is part of the existing legislation, but allow greater flexibility. It is a compromise proposal with a great deal of merit. We hope that the Minister will accept the spirit, if not the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the spirit of amendment No. 31. We will supply wording to improve the typically untidy draftsmanship of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
