	<div class='legislation'>Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Quota Measures) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Quota Measures) Order 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 387).</p></blockquote>
I am grateful for the opportunity to query some aspects of the enforcement order, which makes provision for various penalties to enforce European Council regulation No. 3919/92. The regulation raises many issues concerning total allowable catches and quota measures and their impact on the United Kingdom fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also confers powers of enforcement on British sea fishery officers under article 6. That is topical in view of what happenedd recently off the Channel Islands when sea fishery officers experienced difficulty in boarding ships at sea and HMS Blazer had an unfortunate experience in Cherbourg harbour. It is coincidental that our debate is taking place against the background of those activities, but I shall refer to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled a prayer to enable us to raise some important matters concerning the United Kingdom's fishing industry and we would welcome the Minister's comments on them. First, we want to consider the enforcement measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 3 to 5 cover existing penalties and the recovery of fines. The Opposition have no objection to implementation of the Order because we want proper fishery management in United Kingdom waters and proper powers to back that up, but are the regulations working properly and meeting their objectives of ensuring that our fishery resources are properly managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue that I want to raise is black fish and the illegal landings that take place in almost every port in the country. Such landings tend to be identified with Scotland, but I do not believe that Scotland is alone in that. We do not know the scale of black fish landings, but they occur in every port. A fisherman told me that there is an unofficial black fish economy with black fish quoted rates and that the orders given for black fish exceed the legal quotas which are laid down by the European Community and covered by the order. That fisherman went so far as to say that because the black fish economy is illegal, prices are more stable than the official price offish in the present problems. How does the Minister intend to tackle the problem of black fish, which has existed for a long time and is suspected to be considerable? I have been told that sometimes more black fish are landed in Scottish ports than legal fish, although it is difficult to discover whether that is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations on quota management apply only to fishermen and not to processors. Will the Minister confirm that it is not illegal for processors to buy illegally-landed fish, and will he consider extending a penalty to processors?
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
It is one thing to deal with the landing of fish by the fishermen—the regulations clearly state how penalties will be enforced in that respect—but my understanding of the provisions is that, if the fisherman gets his fish ashore to a processor, the processor can legally buy them. In such a case there seems to be no deterrent that the Minister can implement. In future, could regulations such as these be amended to make it an offence for the processor knowingly to buy illegally landed fish from outside the quota?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fishermen are also involved in that matter. Is the level of fines that is laid down a suitable deterrent? I have spoken to fishermen about black fish and they have told me that they are forced into going down the road. They either break the law or go bankrupt. Faced with such options they take illegal action. I am not saying that that is a justification for breaking these quotas, because there is no such justification. Once one starts to go down that road, one undermines the development of a sustainable fishery and becomes involved in a vicious downward spiral in which fish become scarcer and scarcer and the pressure greater and greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think that the Minister would accept that there is much disaffection in the United Kingdom fishing industry. I hope that the Minister recognises that fact, which cannot be denied when our ports are being blockaded by United Kingdom fishermen. In such an atmosphere, it is harder to get fishermen to obey laws because they become disaffected with authority. They regard the law and the regulations as authority and, quite wrongly, feel that by ignoring the law they are hitting back at authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I do not justify such an attitude, but the British fishing industry faces a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of quotas and TACs is controversial. I know that when we have debated other regulations we have had similar arguments about the best way to manage the European fisheries. Quotas and TACs are a management tool. The problem is highlighted when there are large swings in quotas. The haddock quota was dramatically increased at the beginning of the year. That is a contributory factor to the present crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for introducing technical conservation measures as an alternative to quotas, although I accept that they would be difficult to develop and even more difficult to enforce. The current abuse, with illegal landings, does not inspire confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fishermen must know that they are taking a risk; the penalties for black fish landing are clearly outlined. Fishermen can have their catch and gear confiscated and face considerable fines. However, apparently those penalties not seem to be an adequate deterrent. Will the Minister consider taking the penalties one step further so that fishing licences are suspended? I am reluctant to suggest such a measure because I know that by suspending someone's licence one is suspending that person's way of making their living. However, fishermen suggest that the issue needs to be tackled and that strong deterrents are needed. The strongest deterrent would be licence suspension. Will the Minister consider that possibility?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 of the provisions relates to the powers of British sea fishery officers. Article 6(2)(a) clearly provides that British sea fishery officers have the power to board vessels. If they suspect that an offence has been committed, they have the power to take that boat and crew to the nearest convenient port. In the case of La Calypso, it appears that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
there was a difference of opinion about what was the nearest convenient port. The captain was adamant that it was Cherbourg. He set off for that port, despite what the boarding party said, and with the boarding party on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in such an incident are clear. Article 7 makes it an offence to obstruct officers carrying out their duty. Will the skipper of La Calypso will be prosecuted under that article for ignoring the direction, legally given, by the British fishery protection officer who boarded his vessel? That raises the question of what will happen if a skipper will not co-operate when he has been boarded and directed in that way. In all fairness, the Calypso incident is not the first time that a boarding crew has been taken off a boat against its will and I do not suppose that it will be the last. A policy statement from the Minister would be useful to clarify how he views such incidents and how he thinks the crew should react when the captain of the fishery protection vessel sees his boarding party illegally taken to a foreign port by a vessel which will not respond to his radio signals and which will not stop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current dispute, the press hinted that the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) was suggesting that boarding parties should be armed. It is one thing for the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal to have a little tantrum about Perrier water at press conferences, but it is another to lead a boarding party waving pistols, with a cutlass between his teeth, demanding that action be taken. I know that the Minister takes a more sensible line. I hope that he will calm down the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal when, from time to time, he gets carried away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious issue. What will happen if a vessel, particularly a foreign vessel, will not obey the regulations? I recall that, during the cod war, Icelandic fishery protection vessels began using solid shot. I am loth to suggest that as a solution, although it would be effective. If my memory serves me correctly, the idea of using solid shot was to punch a hole in the fishing vessel to slow it down. However, at least one British crewman was killed accidentally as a result of its use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Co-operation is essential. The order results from an EC measure. It should be taken for granted that every EC member state will abide by the measures agreed by the European Community and will ensure that they are enforced. If one member state is seen not to ensure that its fishermen abide by agreed negotiations and treaties, others will follow suit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incoming French Government have not helped this matter by stating that they want to reopen negotiations on the common agricultural policy and on the general agreement on tariffs and trade. That sends the wrong signal to their citizens and in particular, their fishermen. If the French Government give the impression that they can suddenly renegotiate international treaties that they do not like, how do they expect French fishermen to abide by EC rules that they do not like? The incoming French Government may have given misleading assurances and promises to their electorate. It would not be the first time that that has been done. But I know that you, Mr. Hill, would not want me to go down that road so I shall confine my comments to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crews of HMS Blazer and the Brocklesby acted properly in the circumstances. They carried out their duty professionally, particularly those on board HMS Blazer which had fairly young trainees on board when it was
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
boarded in Cherbourg. They did not allow themselves to be provoked nor did they retaliate inappropriately. Although those crews have been very frustrated by the way in which they were treated, they acted professionally and responsibly. They are entitled to support from the Government and the European Community. I hope that we shall receive assurances that they will be supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the framework of the order and the powers that are being given to the Minister to enforce agreements within the European Community. The Opposition feel, however, that there are problems, particularly regarding black fish landings in Scotland. We feel that there are weaknesses in the way in which the order will operate. Sanctions should be taken against processors. At present, processors can legally buy and use black fish even though, in many cases, they know that it has been landed illegally. If we do not stop that practice, there is no future for the fisheries in this country or in the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the order. I accept that it sharpens the means of enforcing European Community rules on fishing and fish quotas. Much as many of us would like to see the military presence of the Royal Navy strengthened in the channel and offshore waters, I think that the 1,140 days of patrolling which the Royal Navy spends in its operation of the fishery protection service is probably sufficient. No doubt the Minister will let us know whether he disagrees. However, the way to proceed is to increase not the arming of the Royal Navy but diplomatic and political pressure on Governments that are not enforcing the rules. We need to strengthen legislation that is enforceable throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. H. S. Dyson, one of my constituents, wrote to me in January to say how distressed he was when, on holiday in Scotland in late October last year, he saw a large quantity of dead fish in the loch alongside the Kylescu hotel, which is beside Loch Glencoul. I visited Mr. Dyson at his home to discuss the matter with him and his wife. He told me that, the previous evening, a trawler had docked at the loch. It was carrying over the quota of fish that the present law allowed and that surplus had to be dumped in the harbour. I took up the matter with my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. He replied on 17 February with a dead-pan explanation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The requirement to discard fish arises from quota restrictions which limit the amount of fish which can land and the size of fish which can be retained."</p></blockquote>
He went on to expain that because the boat had fished more than its quota it had dumped fish in the harbour. End of story: no shame, no disgrace and no apologies from anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a mere soft-handed southerner from England—albeit married to a Scot—I thought it peculiar that fish could be dumped in such a way. It struck me that there should be a better way of controlling not only how fish are landed but how they are caught. I have read the order, and it seems that at last there will be proper restrictions on the landing and the catching of fish. We will not just be catching fish and dumping them, but will be preventing fish from being caught. The point of the exercise is not to prevent fish being landed, but to prevent the oceans from being deprived of fish for future generations. If that is the purpose of the order, I wholeheartedly welcome it and hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure me on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disabuse the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Vigers) of the notion that the order has a chance of solving the serious problem that he rightly raised. The problem with discards and the conservation regime are, alas, not embraced by the order. I am sure that you, Mr. Hill, would rule me out of order if I went too far down that route, so I shall merely say that the Scottish inshore fishing fleet had been making representations to the Government for years about steps that could be taken to prevent the current level of discards. If the Government spend more time listening to what the industry thought was necessary to address that problem, the problem raised by the hon. Member for Gosport, which concerns us all would not be as difficult to solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is too constrained to deal with such problems and covers enforcement. I should like to emphasise some of the good points made by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). I know that he has studied these matters and that he has the confidence of the fishing industry. He put the case extremely well. However, I want to reinforce his point about black fish because my constituency has one of the smaller North Sea, white-fish boats in Eyemouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is growing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is growing, but if we got a harbour from the Government, it would grow even faster; we are working on that. However, that is an argument for another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the stories that I have heard from the quayside. The problem is that many of them are anecdotal and I do not know how much is true. Do the Government have a way of researching the extent of blackfish in light of the depressing market price of fish? Somebody somewhere must be making a killing. When I do my shopping in my liberated husbandly way at the weekend and buy my quota of haddock from Eyemouth, I notice that the price has not fallen a penny. However, when I hold my surgery after my shopping, fishermen complain about the price offish. Something is wrong with the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman uses the wrong shop; he should try Ian Waddell's shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, it was Ian Waddell's shop!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point is that the Government must look beyond the problem of illegal landing and research what is happening to the structure of the market. They should also consider what is happening with processors. I am told—but there is no evidence for this—that the processors are operating black contracts, many of which were arranged last year when the problem was more acute because quotas were much tighter. More relaxed quotas should mean that the problem would disappear and I am concerned that it is continuing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent to which quayside prices are depressed is deeply worrying and cannot continue if the industry is to be sustained. Will the Minister say whether any research is being carried out to consider the downstream or upstream effects—whichever is the correct term—on the market for white fish after the processing stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about smaller boats, which are in a more vulnerable position than bigger boats. It is not in the industry's interests that fishermen should fall out with one
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
another. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation and other lobby organisations and associations that work for the industry south of the border and in Scotland are advancing a coherent case. I do not want to introduce any division into the debate but owners of smaller boats tell me that they are suffering more than owners of bigger boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are there enough sea fishery officers? I tabled some written questions, which revealed that the number of sea fishery officers is inadequate to meet demand. I understand the constraints on public expenditure and that we cannot expand that number overnight because training and experience are necessary, but is there no way in the short term—perhaps in the next six months—in which people could be drafted in to back up sea fishery officers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. Members for Gosport and for Glanford and Scunthorpe about the need for diplomacy rather than open warfare when dealing with the French situation. The problem is worrying for our industry and gives added impetus to the argument that enforcement in other Community countries is much more lax than here. I do not know whether that is true, but the industry has made strong representations to me that we strictly enforce regulations but other countries allow their fishing industry and skippers to get away with the fishing equivalent of murder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Piracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Murder or piracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me neatly to my final point—the French incident involving 
	<i>La Calypso.</i> The Government must take a firm but diplomatic line. I am content that the matter is left in the hands of the Minister, so long as he assures us that we may go back to our ports and fishermen and tell them that no stone will be left unturned, that the perpetrators of the piracy will be properly dealt with and that the regulations will be stringently enforced. If we cannot do that, their suspicions and fears that they are dealt with more severely than fishermen in other countries may be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is important and I know that the Minister will not deal with it casually. I hope that he will give us some assurances about our home ports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I share the interest expressed by my neighbour and Member of Parliament, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). We both represent fishermen who work from small ports in southeast Scotland and who are concerned about their livelihoods and the competing interests of fishing fleets in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe about black fish and the need to control that trade. I agree with the hon. Member for Gosport that it is obscene for fish to be caught and killed and then dumped overboard because EC regulations do not permit the marketing of that fish. It is even worse if the fish is dumped at the quayside. That should be a contravention of environmental health regulations and I was surprised to hear the terms of the reply that the hon. Member for Gosport received from the Scottish Office.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I share another interest with the hon. Member for Gosport: we are both Members of the Select Committee on Defence and I believe that all its Members will be interested in the implications of recent events on the future of fishery protection operations, which is on the agenda of the Committee's meeting for tomorrow morning. It would be helpful if the Minister of State would deal with that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6(1) covers the powers of British sea fishery officers and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of enforcing article 3 of this Order, a British sea-fishery officer—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) may go on board any fishing boat registered in the United Kingdom wherever it may be or any other fishing boat which is within British fishery limits"—</p></blockquote>
I believe that that includes the Channel Islands—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) may require any such boat to stop and do anything else to enable him to board it;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) may require the attendance of the master of the boat or any other person on board;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) may require any person on board to assist him in the performance of his functions".</p></blockquote>
Whether the master of the boat can tell him to "Allez Sauter dans la mer" may be irrelevant but the regulations are important. What is the point in fishery protection vessels patrolling the seas, which they do very efficiently, if, when they board a vessel that is contravening regulations, they may be hijacked?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a British sea-fishery officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence under article 3 of this Order has been committed in respect of a boat that he has power to go on board … and if he has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been committed within British fishery limits, the officer—

	<ol>

	<li>may require the master to take, or may himself take, the boat and its crew to the port which appears to the officer to be the nearest convenient port; and</li>

	<li>may detain the boat in the port."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe said, the appropriate port would have been a Channel Islands port, but the crew of the fishing vessel made off with the crew of the fishery protection vessel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 covers obstruction of officers. What happened in the Channel Islands recently could be loosely described as "obstruction of officers"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We all have copies of the order and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will merely refer to the various articles rather than reading them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had concluded, Mr. Hill, but it is relevant to refer to article 7 which states that any person who
	<br><blockquote><p>"assaults an officer who is exercising"</p></blockquote>
his powers
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be guilty of an offence and liable—

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>(i) on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000".</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
The order is excellent. I am sure that we all agree that there should be more effective and efficient enforcement of European Community fisheries protection legislation, but it is pointless if it does not work. It is right that we are debating the matter following the recent topical events when the preceding regulations were flouted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pointless to ask naval personnel to board fishing vessels to enforce regulations and to attempt to bring offenders to justice if they know that they may be hijacked with impunity, as has recently happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to say something about what has happened in recent days and that he will report to the Committee and the House on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
discussions with his French and European Community counterparts on what action will be taken. Without appropriate action, the incident is degenerating into a joke. Quota regulations are held in low regard in many ports where it is felt that the British enforce the regulations for their own fishing fleet but fishing vessels from other member states are allowed to treat the regulations with total impunity. If the legislation is to stand up in future, it must be credible. Surely we can give the French a clear assurance that were British fisherman ever to behave in such a way, we would ensure that they were taken to France to face the music in front of the French authorities. The least that we can expect is for the French authorities and other EC authorities to reciprocate. For the welfare offish stocks and our fishing communities, the regulations must be respected across the board. I am sure that the Committee is unanimous on that issue and I hope that the Minister and you, Mr. Hill, will not object to me, as an interloper, coming here to put that point on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.5 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I received a little card that invited me to the Committee and so I came along. I do not think that I shall be invited again after I have had my say. I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe. I would oppose the order because it is utter garbage. I speak as a tired old lawyer, and I declared an interest as a practising barrister. When one considers the question of quotas and penalties, it seems to me that, once quotas have been reached—the Minister can correct me if I am wrong—we say, "That's it, boys; your fishing stops for a while."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I select as an example the Lowestoft fleet because I understand that Lowestoft's Member of Parliament, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, would be slightly interested in this matter. It is not my passion and I do not want to trespass because St. Helens may have seamen but it has yet to have a fishing fleet. One never knows what might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out goes the fleet. Three tonnes of cod are left on the quota. At dawn the fleet returns. The boats have been communicating with one another but, when a net is cast over the side, it cannot be calculated how much fish will come up with it. The 17 fishing vessels come back into the port and, instead of having 3 tonnes, they have 7 tonnes. That means that they are 4 tonnes over quota. Which vessel is prosecuted? The order does not make that clear. Should any prosecution be carried out proportionately or should it be on a first-in, last-out basis? These are serious points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind that the French have yet to obey a Community order. Why should we think that they will obey these regulations? There should be a level playing field for all fishing fleets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 deals with penalties. It is interesting to note the distinction in article 5 between how the law is enforced in Scotland and in England. It is a minor point but apparently in Scotland the boat can be sold but in England it cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4(1)(b) provides that, in England, fishermen can be subjected to a
	<br><blockquote><p>"fine not exceeding the value of any fish"</p></blockquote>
or the fish, net and gear can be forfeited. However, having made that provision, the order does not state whether the boat can be sold at that stage or whether it will be forfeited. If the boat is forfeited, how can the fine be paid? That may seem academic, but if a man's livelihood is removed, how
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
will he pay the fine? I cannot see the good burghers of Bordeaux or of any other French fishing ports going down the same line and enforcing the order. I think that, once again, we have been sold a small pup.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question of recovery, in England, the court may
	<br><blockquote><p>"issue a warrant of distress against the boat and its gear and catch".</p></blockquote>
In Scotland, however, the boat, its gear and catch can be sld. Why the difference? When we draft legislation, we must get it right. Practising lawyers have made their fortunes over the years getting it wrong. Everytime the law is wrong, I go to court to get it right or to get a judgment one way or another. The Committee has heard me say far too often in the past that that is not good enough. What happens when a company that is a partnership, not a corporate body, breaks the quota? Corporate bodies are dealt with in articles 7 and 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Grimsby trawlers are in partnership; several people own several boats. Four partners may own three boats or three partners may own four boats. Which boat is levelled against? Such a case would not be covered under the legislation. If one partner, acting on a frolic of his own, decided to break the quota, should we find against the partnership, thus penalising his innocent partners? That may be right in medieval French law, but not in English law. It completely flies in the face of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a corporate aspect that must be considered. How could it be proved that the company director or manager gave a direct order? I shall wait for the Minister's advice before I finish devising on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 deals with the powers of British sea-fishery officers. Article 6(1)(e) states that the officer
	<br><blockquote><p>"may take with him, to assist in performing his functions, any other person and any equipment or materials".</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? Will the officer bring along his own hacking device to get into the computer of the trawler company? Articles 6 and 7 refer to documents which would mean that the officer would run up against the laws dealing with computers. If the knowledge is on a computer disc or in the storage cells of a computer, is it a document? The answer would be "no". What is the point? If the officer cannot get into the computer, he will get nowhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are not many computers on fishing boats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many computers in companies which store information about the trade in vessels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, wants to intervene; the hon. Member for St. Helens, South will give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Hill. It would probably be quicker and simpler to take the hon. Gentleman outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the equipment and materials mentioned in article 6(1)(e)? Could the sea fishery officer take along the Scots Guards or armed soldiers, or sailors? Who would make that decision and would that person be accountable? In other parts of law, a warrant, issued by a magistrate or sheriff, is needed to carry out a search whether it be in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The British sea fishery officer would make the decision himself. But on
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
what would that be based? Article 6(6)(a) and (b) refer to "reasonable grounds". How would reasonable grounds be defined?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that that question has traditionally been well answered by Customs and Excise over many centuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say from some little experience, having declared my interests in advance and having spent the past three months arguing with Customs and Excise officers at the Bar, that evidence is needed to prove reasonable grounds. However, the sea fishery officer will carry out spotchecks. I am not criticising the sea fishery officers who do a great job. I thought that it was sad that the French fishermen will never be brought to justice. Let us be blunt about that—no one will seek to enforce the law. The Minister cannot assure me that he is seeking the extradition via the Home Office, of those terrible French fishermen who kidnapped our poor boys. We have been made a laughing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officers can board out of the blue. But there should be a need for evidence. A case would never stand up in an English court without it. The officer might get it wrong and what would happen then? Would he say, "Sorry chaps, we're off now". Let us be reasonable when we pass legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6(1)(f)(iv) allows the officer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"take copies of any such document."</p></blockquote>
That, presumably, will be a document that has been left lying around which says, "Yesterday, I caught four tonnes of black cod." How wide is the power? Surely, the order should state "relevant documents". On the basis of what is in the order, the sea fishery officer could enter the home of a trawlerman or a trawler captain and take his marriage certificate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no power to go into a home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I realise that. I used the home as an example. You could walk onto a trawlerman's ship and take his marriage certificate. That must be relevant. If the Government are going to draft legislation, it should be within the meaning of English justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6(5)(b) states that the sea fishery officer
	<br><blockquote><p>"may examine any fish on the premises".</p></blockquote>
I have a wonderful little thought going through my head, facetious though it may be. I suppose that your black fish and non-quota fish carry a special stamp. How do you tell a quota fish from a non-quota fish? Let us be realistic. Of course you can examine the premises, but how will you show that that particular cod, in cold storage, in Grimsby—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to have to show it, am I?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Hill, you will not have to show it—you have more sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are addressing me, therefore, you are asking me to have special stamps for black fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Hill. But—if I may put it this way—I am using you as the wall against which I bounce the balls to hit the Minister. I am not allowed to address him directly; my comments must go through the Chair. I did not really want to hit him anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do tell—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does one tell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does anybody tell—how does the court tell what is a black fish among any load offish? Article 6(5)(c) states that a British sea fishery officer
	<br><blockquote><p>"may require any person on the premises to produce any documents".</p></blockquote>
What documents? How does one know? Again, the legislation is badly drafted and—to put it bluntly—it has no teeth and does not facilitate access to computers. I do not understand how the article will stand up if it is ever tested in, for example, the European Court, on the question of thefts and equality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure us that every EC country will bring into effect or have foisted upon them similar legislation? We must bear in mind that there are 12 different legal jurisdictions, with 12 different methods of enforcement. I ask myself one very simple question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not asked a simple question yet!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that might be the problem: I look forward, with joy, to hearing the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In whose jurisdiction does one bring the charge of assault? Let us take a mythical example, similar to what happened to La Calypso. The boarding party are bashed on the head and rendered unconscious. The fishermen flee to their French, Dutch or Belgian havens. If the ship is registered in France, Germany, Holland or Belgium, it is French, German, Holland or Belgian territory. Where is the charge of assault made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a British officer enters a foreign jurisdiction. Bearing in mind the different legal systems on the continent, how do we force the French courts of French examining magistrates to bring a count of assault, or its equivalent under French law? We have no such jurisdiction. We can ask politely for extradition, but we will not get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure me that the level of fines proposed in the order will be the same in real terms in each of the European courts? If the franc is a weak currency at any particular time—or the mark, lira or any other currency—we must ensure equality. Can we force the French Government—or any other Government—to impose a series of statutory fines in their system of legislation as we have in column 3? If we do not, we do not have a level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also undertake to ensure that if the regulations are brought in across the EC, prosecutions will be brought in other ports? My information is that nobody if prosecuted anywhere on the continent for any matter connected with fishing, for breaking limits or anything else, but our fishermen are prosecuted. That is not fair, as we say in the north-west. We do not think that the Minister will be treating British fishermen fairly until he ensures that everybody in the European network is treated the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.20 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) at least convinces me that two of my three children were right in deciding to study jurisprudence. No doubt what he said will come in extremely useful for administrative law studies when they are studying at Corpus Christi, Oxford, and King's, London, respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The hon. Member for Glandford and Scunthorpe suffers from a major defect as the Opposition spokesman: he is, basically, a reasonable man. Furthermore, he accused me of being a reasonable man, so two of us stand accused of reasonableness before our peers. I hope that that will not affect our respective careers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first deal with the order and then I shall discuss other issues raised by hon. Members in the debate. I should tell the hon. Member for St. Helens, South that this is the tenth or eleventh appearance of the Order. It has been operating for a decade or so and appears to be working effectively. Confusion does not seem to be reigning throughout the United Kingdom and its dependent territories because of the working of the Order. The answer to the question whether it is working seems to be yes, because, as far as I know, nobody has challenged it or referred it to the European Court of Justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, there will always be work for lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is a routine document. I hesitate to say that. Whenever a document is not routine I always tell the Committee so, so that when I do they believe me. It is a routine document and we have considered it in previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every year, we need several statutory instruments for full enforcement of the annual TACs and quotas. Some refer to technical conservation, for example. The 1993 TACs and quotas were set out in Community regulation No. 3919/92, which was approved by the Fisheries Council on 20 December. Some Community regulations on sea fishing are directly enforceable in United Kingdom ports under section 30(1) of the Fisheries Act 1981. The Act permits us to bring charges against people only for illegal fishing in United Kingdom limits—not for the fish that they might have on board even if they are not fishing, or the fish that they land. The order permits us to charge in relation to offences that occur outside the British fisheries limits. It is necessary to supplement our permitted action under the basic rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1981 Act also provides that if we wish to set lower fines for certain offences where the maximum penalty of £50,000 would be too much, we must introduce a statutory instrument to do so. That, again, permits us to levy lower fines. The level of fines is set in accordance with the generality prevailing across the legal system for certain categories of offences. The order, which is made under section 30(2) of the Fisheries Act 1981, covers any fishing boat registered in the United Kingdom, wherever it fishes, or any fishing boat, of whatever origin, fishing within British fishery limits, including the fishery limits off the Channel Islands. It provides for penalties which include a fine and forfeiture of gear and of the catch. The maximum penalties that the order specifies correspond to those for analagous offences under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Offences for illegal landing of, for example, over-quota fish, will be punishable on summary conviction by a fine that does not exceed the statutory maximum, which is usually £5,000. The order provides for the necessary powers of entry for sea fisheries officers. Those powers are provided for other fisheries offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, who said that he did not contest the order. I wish, however, to use the occasion to debate several fisheries issues. The hon. Members for Glanford and Scunthorpe and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire focused on black fish. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe quoted remarks that fishermen have made to him. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said that much of the evidence is anecdotal and thus difficult to pin down. Anyone who believes that there is no black fish market must live in utopia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe claims that a parallel market exists for black fish. The fish are sold on the black market; they are not declared for income tax purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All cash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be cautious when we assess income levels in the industry because they discount any earnings on the side from the black-fish market. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe said that that undermined stable fisheries. We agree. But what can be done? We have examined the problem. The hon. Member for St. Helens, South would be the first to stress that it is difficult to enforce some measures. We could move away from our current policy of liberality, which allows fishermen to land fish in any nook and cranny of the United Kingdom where a ship will float. We could establish designated ports and focus our enforcement efforts on specific ports. Some arguments exist in favour of that. However, there are two arguments against that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I would not wish to receive representations from hon. Friends who represented ports that were no longer open to fisheries. There are about 200 ports. There are many sea fisheries in which fishery inspectors operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it might be illegal to land outside a designated port, but people will continue to do that. Evasion will still be a problem. Enforcement might be slightly easier in that any vessel that was in a forbidden nook or cranny would be committing an offence. However, we would have to prove that the ship had not landed there because of engine failure, or because the fisherman was visiting his mother-in-law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been considering how to deal with processors who buy black fish. It would be simple to place the onus on them to demonstrate that they bought the fish listed on their books from a bona fide seller of bona fide fish. Changing the emphasis could tighten up matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have sought to get to grips with the problem. However, we must ensure that any further regulatory action could be effectively enforced. I am open to all suggestions, especially those of qualified people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Designated ports could be linked to compulsory radioing in. Fishermen would be allowed to land only in specific ports and required to telephone in advance the time of arrival and the contents of the boat. What is to be done if the fisherman claims that the phone broke or that he could not get through because 15 others were trying to telephone at the same time? Courts deal with fisheries offences fairly leniently. They tend to believe a fishermen who claims that
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
he couldn't avoid committing the offence or that he has 15 children to feed. The stories that magistrates believe are legion. It is quite difficult to get convictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making some very serious points, but a recent court case in Scotland is relevant. A fisheries protection plane with two people on board indentified a vessel fishing illegally. However, only the observer was able to see and verify the vessel because the pilot of the plane was distracted. Scottish law requires that two people must verify such a sighting. Should not that requirement be examined in connection with the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill dealt with Scottish rules of evidence. Previously, the uncorroborated evidence of log books could not be used to secure a conviction in Scotland, whereas such evidence was valid in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for St. Helens, South said, the third matter under examination concerns whether we can create an offence of handling black fish, or whether the onus can be put on the processor. However, the hon. Gentleman acknowledged the difficulties involved in identifying which fish are black and which are not and of disproving claims that fishermen did not know which was which. We are investigating the possibilities and intend to pursue that line of investigation further. I do not pretend that we have an answer to the problem, but we are trying to find one that will deliver a positive benefit without requiring a whole new apparatus of regulation that would be unenforceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Ministry and the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department are doing their best. However, will the Minister confirm that the Home Office and the police are equally interested in enforcing the legislation? Last summer, I found myself in a dilemma when an unmarked Transit van driven by people from the North Shields area appeared outside my door at home with fish for sale. What was going on was self-evident to me, and it entered my head that I should telephone the local police. However, it then occurred to me that they had more important things to do than chase up such obscure leads. Are the police interested in enforcing fisheries legislation at that end of the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the normal law enforcement agencies can be called upon if a pattern of activity is identified which reasonably can be suspected of illegality. From what the hon. Member for East Lothian said, the unmarked Transit van might be caught on public health grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept that there are problems with managing and policing quotas. The possibility offered by multispecies TACs may provided an alternative to that fairly rigid annual division, but the danger is that a fisherman will catch his three-year quota in the first 15 months. It is interesting to note that at present, in the absence of restrictions on fishermen apart from those imposed by the broad TAC regulations and the technical conservation regulations, it appears that fishermen are going out to catch early in the season. Even though quotas such as those for haddock are significantly higher than last year, there may be a problem towards the end of the year because the quota

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
will have been taken up. Certain habits in the industry are deeply ingrained and militate against the management of the stocks. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe is a reasonable man and will understand that that is one of the problems that we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn to the problem of La Calypso and the events off the Channel Islands. On Sunday, the Royal Navy vessel put a boarding party on La Calypso. Everyone knows what happened next. Had the captain pursued that vessel there would have been the possibility of a collision and a resultant loss of life. At that time, three naval officers were on board the French vessel. Moreover, the vessels were in an area where our territorial waters ended and those of the French began, with practically nothing in between. Such circumstances do not arise often. There were no high seas in which a pursuit could be conducted, although boardings usually take place within our 200-mile fishery limit, with an awful lot of sea between the vessel being boarded and its home port. If the vessel concerned is English or Scottish, the naval vessel will be stationed between it and its home port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe that the captain behaved sensibly in the circumstances. We all feel aggrieved and shocked by the incident, but in the circumstances the judgment that was made was probably right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such incidents are few and far between. Our fisheries protection vessels make 500 boardings a year, so for most of the time the system works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of arming boarding parties was raised. If we were to follow that suggestion, all boarding parties would have to be armed because boats interchange. Thirteen or fourteen vessels are on patrol periodically and five vessels are on patrol permanently, including those of the Scottish Royal Navy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arming boarding parties would alter the character of the protection that we offer and the risk of the loss of life would always be present. A silly crisis might arise over fish, but as soon as there was a loss of life it would take the crisis into an entirely different realm. We must therefore be extremely cautious before saying that we shall use this episode to justify a permanent escalation in the protection that we offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked about the use of the Royal Navy in fishery protection. Indeed, we renewed the Royal Navy's contract only last week after lengthy negotiations. There were some problems with the service offered. For instance, Navy ships were liabel to be called off duty. Some of them had limited endurance, and the amount of time that they could spend at sea was not as long as we should have liked. When on duty, they provided outstanding service, but there were problems with the regularity of their duty and their ability to stay on station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when we renewed the Navy's contract we quite properly sought to enhance its performance to achieve better value for money. We pay a significant amount under the contract and wanted better service from the Navy. Some people may accuse me of being unduly hard on the Navy, but as my son wishes to join it I have a vested interest that he will still have a Navy for him to join.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been about 50,000 boardings since such an incident last occurred in the mid-1970s, when the skipper of the French boat concerned lost his licence and was imprisoned by the French authorities. The hon. Member for St. Helens, South asked whether other countries impose the same fines as us. Some countries, of which France is one, impose more severe penalties than us. When the French throw a book at somebody, it is a pretty heavy book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the problem is that when the French throw the book it is fairly heavy but that they have only one copy and they do not pick it up very often?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only incident with which we can compare the latest one took place rather a long time ago and I am glad that it has not been repeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport mentioned Mr. Dyson. I suspect that Mr. Dyson encountered a skipper who was intending to land more than his quota but who had the misfortune to find a sea fishery officer on the quayside. Therfore, he got shot of his fish—quickly and illegally—in the harbour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport was right to ask why we had discarding. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe may say that at least there is one benefit but, in fact, there is no benefit. The sheer amount of discarded fish that is available for scavenging has changed the ecology of the sea bird population around the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is twofold. We could say that every fish that is caught must be landed. That would mean that there would be no discarding. In reality, fish would still be dumped because fishermen would be anxious to ensure that the catch that they landed was of the highest-valued species and best sort of fish. A fisherman would not go into port carrying fish of low value if they counted against his quota. The committee would agree that that would only be human nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we allowed fish to be landed without being counted against the quota, we would be establishing a parallel market of poor fish. We would remove the incentive to avoid catching poor quality fish and a fishmeal undermarket would be created on the basis of quotas. Therefore, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport that discards are intensely unsatisfactory but we have yet to find a means of avoiding them. A longer-term way of dealing with the problem would be to introduce technical conservation measures that are more selective about the nature of fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that there is a problem, but we are trying to find ways to make the system work better. This is not a matter for political argument because we acknowledge the nature of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire has left the Committee, but I think that I covered his points in my earlier remarks about enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a valid point about the level of fishery enforcement in the ports. Will the Minister touch upon the impact of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1992? In answer to a written question, he said that he thought that it would cost an extra £1.4 million to enforce the days-at-sea regulations under that Act. What impact does he think that that will have on fishery enforcement? He has already acknowledged a potential problem in enforcement and yet a measure will soon create even greater problems in that respect. Where will the money come from for that provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have the money in the budget; it has not been docked out of decommissioning. I make that clear in case that was the purpose behind the hon. Gentleman's question. The answer to the question of the hon. Member Roxburgh and Berwickshire, which the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe has now taken over, is that there are 158 officers, as well as auxiliaries. That makes a total complement of about 200 people who are competent to carry out the job. In addition, including the Scottish operation, there are five Royal Navy vessels on control, and the Scots have also contracted civilian vessels which carry out enforcement effectively. Three aircraft are contracted, against the civilian contract, to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and two to the Scottish Office. That means that five aircraft carry out enforcement. To some extent, where the ships go depends on what the spotter aircrafts have seen and where they direct them. The pattern of activity, for obvious reasons, is operationally confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vessels are dedicated fishery protection vessels that have been built for that purpose. They are not naval vessels that have been pressed into fishery protection service. They are subject to specific naval training and discipline. They rapidly acquire the ability to understand what another vessel is doing by, for example, using satellite which is an eventual option. The pattern of the movement of a boat often indicates the nature of its fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the mysterious equipment taken on board by the sea fishery officer is a ladder and measuring gear. Even in the high-tech age, there is still only one way of getting from one level to another on a fishing vessel, short of installing lifts. High-tech was not one of La Calypso's stronger points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quotas of producer organisations are individual to the boats and to back records. Outside the producer organisations—the non-sector—quotas are applied as a whole in a particular fishery. We monitor carefully the pattern of the landings, and the findings are available to local fishermen, who are able to ascertain how the catches are coming along. At the end of last year, when all the fisheries were closed, I went over every fishery to examine the success of the closure. I accept that declared landings are not the same as actual landings. However, the 100 per cent. declared landings were accurately hit across all the fishing grounds.

I hope that the hon. Member for St. Helens, South will forgive me for taking refuge in not being a lawyer for not answering some of his more complex questions. I promise that one of my lawyers will draft a letter to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before this harmony goes too far, I want to put to the Minister a couple of my earlier points relating to the Calypso incident. He moved on from that matter quicker than I thought he would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it would be bad if we were to have armed boardings. That would give the wrong message and, as the Minister has rightly said, it would be seen as escalating the situation and as being provocative. We would not want that. By the same token, surely an alarming precedent has been set. Someone has illegally and with impunity been able to make off with naval personnel on board his boat. The Minister told us that 50,000 boardings ago, the French threw the book at the last person who did that. Does the Minister think that the French will throw the book on this occasion? It is an important point, and I assume that it has been discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used the term rules of engagement. That was not intended to suggest that people boarding vessels should carry sidearms. In light of the precedent set, it is important that it is made clear to any skipper of any vessel who may be minded to try that trick again that he would be running the risk of getting into genuine trouble, either with British fishery protection vessels or with fishery protection vessels from his own country. There must be reciprocal action, otherwise the entire arrangement is a farce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we have been in close contact with the French authorities. That, by necessity, has been at senior official level because I do not have an opposite number. The French Fishery Minister has not yet been appointed. In this lacuna, we have had no option but to talk to senior officials. We deal frequently with them so they are well known to us. Indeed, the senior permanent official in the Fisheries Department is, at this minute, talking to the Normandy fishermen about the episode. The fishermen have been called to Paris and will be told that the agreement, which was signed on the Schole bank, has not been renegotiated. We asked the senior permanent official this morning to discuss the matter with fishermen and to guarantee free trade. It is agreed that that is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clearly stated that the Navy has clear instructions and that the Government will ensure that there are the means to carry out the instructions. It is hoped that talks will defuse the problem. Easter weekend is coming, and it usually provides the best market for fish each year. It would be sensible to start fishing and supply the market. It would be intolerable if there were a peripatetic flotilla of French vessels collecting Danegeld from various ports because it felt offended by a fisheries agreement. We shall ensure that if that were to happen, the necessary deterrent is available. The hon. Member for East Lothian understands that I do not want to say, "I am going to send a boat here, a boat there and a boat somewhere else." That would not help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I represent more of the Royal Navy than any Member of Parliament. Does my hon. Friend realise how deeply the Royal Navy, my constituents and people throughout the country were affronted by the

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the use of force is wrong, but have representations been made at the highest level? I accept that the French are progressing from socialism to right-of-centre Government, but perhaps official representation is not enough. Have representations been made at ambassadorial level? If not, why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a distinction between representations which are specific to fishing and representations about the affront to which my hon. Friend referred. The answer to his question is yes, at the highest level. When the new highest echelon in France is established more clearly, the matter will be pursued. I give my hon. Friend the undertaking that the Government will pursue it. I intend to discuss fisheries with my opposite number.
