	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Ms Joyce Quinn)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Framework Agreement for Trade and Co-operation between the European Community and its Member States and the Republic of Korea) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to consider the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Economic Partnership, Political Co-ordination and Co-operation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the United Mexican States) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate focuses on an agreement designed to extend economic and commercial co-operation between the European Union and Korea and Mexico. The framework agreement with Korea was signed in October 1996. It aims to strengthen relations through increased economic and commercial co-operation. It includes steps to improve co-operation on trade liberalisation and on the harmonisation of economic structures between the European Union and Korea. This process should create new opportunities for trade and investment, bringing benefits to business and consumers in the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement contains provisions for economic co-operation in a wide range of areas, including agriculture and fisheries, maritime transport and shipbuilding, and it provides for co-operation on issues of mutual concern such as drugs and money laundering, environmental matters, science and technology, energy, culture and aid for less-developed countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement represents an important development in the European Union's relations with Korea. Once implemented, it will provide the basis for a new level of communication and co-operation at all levels. Eight of our 14 EU partners have ratified the agreement. Britain has a long-standing and close relationship with Korea, which, in many ways, it views as its natural partner in Europe. I ask the Committee to support the further development of this special relationship by giving its approval to the principles behind the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The economic partnership, political co-ordination and co-operation agreement with Mexico was signed on 8 December 1997 and replaced an existing framework co-operation agreement signed in 1991. The new agreement responds to conclusions reached at the June 1994 European Council, which set out the European Union's intention to strengthen its political and economic relations with Mexico. The agreement aims to strengthen relations with intensified political dialogue, reinforced economic and commercial relations and increased co-operation in other areas. It includes provisions to improve political dialogue on bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest. It permits regular meetings at ministerial level under the auspices of a joint council, established by the agreement. It contains provisions to encourage the development of trade in goods and services between the EU and Mexico, including the negotiation of an EU-Mexico free trade agreement in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations on a free trade agreement began in November last year, following an interim agreement and, when concluded—probably later this year—it will help to redress the competitive advantage gained by the United States and Canada in the Mexican market through the north American free trade agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement also includes measures to allow more active co-operation on issues such as drugs, the environment, social affairs and education. The agreement is underpinned by a commitment by the parties to respect democratic principles and human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement represents an important development in the European Union's relations with Mexico. Once implemented, it will provide the basis for a new level of dialogue and co-operation in all areas of the EU-Mexico relationship. Trade figures show that Mexico is one of Europe's most important partners in Latin America. The United Kingdom has a long-standing relationship with Mexico; it has become stronger in recent years, with regular high-level political dialogue on a range of issues. We were active within the European Union in bringing negotiation of the co-operation agreement to a successful conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy to respond to the hon. Member's questions and comments. As the Minister for Europe, I take a keen interest in agreements such as these. The countries with which Europe concludes agreements cover the globe. Responsibility for those other countries often lies with other Foreign Office colleagues. Our much-lamented and respected colleague, Derek Fatchett, accompanied the Queen on her recent successful visit to Korea. He did much to establish a relationship between Britain and Korea. The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd) has been in ministerial dialogue with colleagues in Mexico. I undertake to provide the Committee with further information if I am able to answer questions on the matters before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Trend 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Windsor)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is becoming increasingly familiar with mixed competence agreements, of which these are the latest to come before us. I am becoming increasingly familiar with them, having done a few, yet I still ask myself precisely what they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the agereement with Korea. South Korea has had a difficult and turbulent history over the past few years. Last Monday 
	<i>The Times</i> reported that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the once-bouncy tigers are rising shakily to their feet. South Korea leads the way. After contracting by 5.5 per cent. last year, forecasts for 1999 predict 2 per cent. growth for this year",</p></blockquote>
which is welcome news. That growth must be set against the background of an extraordinary amount of rescue loans—about $58 billion was put into South Korea. Investor confidence in South Korea is increasing, and for the first time that I can recall outside investors are being invited to invest capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the European front, there have been problems with the agreement, principally in financial services, capital flows, shipbuilding and the carrying of bulk cargoes. Will the Minister assure us that those have been addressed satisfactorily? Inward investment in to the United Kingdom from South Korea has been an important feature of our lives in recent years. I understand that we are South Korea's largest European trading partner, having recently overtaken Germany. The relationship is important to both countries, and in that regard the Minister referred to the extremely successful, high-profile royal visit to South Korea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a number of important links with South Korea. We were the first European country to establish diplomatic relations with it, and it is the 50th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations after the second world war, when it regained its independence. In the light of the priceless memory of the important role that British armed forces played in the Korean war, the royal visit was very welcome and it is welcome that we should be entering into this agreement with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister cast some light on a remark in the Government's explanatory memorandum of September 1997? The Government's view then was that we were awaiting a commission proposal on a legal basis. There clearly was some disagreement or uncertainty about the legal basis of proceedings, especially about whether the European Parliament's assent would be necessary. I imagine that it would be, but I cannot find an answer to my question from public records, which is why I ask now. The matter was resolved because the European Parliament voted on it in May 1998, but what was the area of doubt? If an important precedent was created by taking the agreement through the European Parliament, did it represent a development in the extraordinarily complex theology of the European Union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 19 April reported on the fourth round of talks between the European Union and Mexico. In its opinion, these
	<br><blockquote><p>"showed the first serious signs of tension since Mexico and the EU began free trade negotiations last November."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
There was some doubt about whether the parties could proceed to a fifth round of talks unless the talks had some purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister envisage any change in the nature of the relationship between the European Union and Mexico as a result of our passing this agreement? Clearly all is not well between the two parties. In broad terms, what does the agreement add to attempts to resolve the difficulties that exist between the two parties? Which parts of the agreement are diplomatic niceties, and which are obligations that the parties intend to stick to and, if necessary, enforce? The Minister spoke of human rights and of an underpinning in the agreement. We know that in Mexico in recent times there have been serious difficulties due to the long-running conflict between the Zapatistas and the Government forces. There have been reports of disappearances and drug-related crimes. Amnesty International has, for many years, published reported that are not wholly favourable. Under the agreement, the observance of human rights does appear to be not an objective but a pre-supposed condition that Mexico has, in theory at least, already fulfilled, although it must also continue to fulfil its obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 58(2) of the PCA on the fulfilment of obligations is intended to include article 1 within the remit of the joint council's mandate. Article 3(1) is vague on the sanctions that might be taken, referring only to appropriate measures as measures to be taken in accordance with international law. Will the agreement make any difference? How does it add to our desire to improve the observance of human rights throughout the world? Mexico, like South Korea, has been through difficult economic and social problems in the recent past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish both agreements well, but I ask the Minister to address some of the specific questions I have put to her and the sense that I have that, however worthy the agreements are, their purpose must be tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my condolences to the hon. Lady and colleagues on the death of Derek Fatchett? This is the first opportunity I have had to record my feelings. He and I had many exchanges over the past two years. His ability as a Minister and his qualities as a man shone through. We will miss him greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mexico and South Korea are important countries in the context of their regional settings in south-east Asia and central America. I do not want to detain the Committee for long because I believe that we should support the orders, but I have some brief questions. As the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend) said, financial circumstances have changed in south-east Asia since the framework agreement was originally formulated in October 1996, but to what extent is the agreement, as drafted, appropriate to the changed financial situation? We should recognise and congratulate the Korean Government on the speed with which they have coped with the financial crisis.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
They have shown how a popularly elected Government with a mandate can work their way through a crisis, whereas the way in which the Government of Indonesia have handled the crisis has led to long-term instability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the continuing process of constitutional reform in Korea, further checks and balances will be incorporated in the system, which is very welcome, but there is a perceived problem with the dominance of the larger companies in Korea. Will monopoly issues have to be resolved before improved market access can become a reality? The European Union must be sensitive to the delicate position of relationships between South Korea and North Korea and to the welcome overtures made by the Korean Government. Does the agreement encourage increased trade across the border and throughout the peninsula as a whole? Will the EU benefit from increased access, if that is possible, to North Korea under the agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worldwide financial crisis has affected the united Mexican states. In order to mitigate the effects of fluctuating oil prices, the OECD has proposed the creation of a stabilisation fund for Mexico, which would stagger the impact of volatility and provide economic stability. Is that a real prospect, and does this agreement affect that process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the point made by the hon. Member for Windsor about Mexico's human rights record—it is a matter of concern. A number of allegations have been made against the Mexican Government over recent months and years. The attitude of the Mexican Government has been to resist foreign intervention from any source, be it from Europe or elsewhere. Nevertheless, I hope that, under the agreement, we shall use every ounce of leverage to improve human rights and move forward with Mexico on a secure footing for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the tenor of the comments that have been made and the thrust of the questions asked by the hon. Members for Windsor and for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). I do not know whether it is of some consolation to the hon. Member for Windsor to know that we have undergone a similar process of asking questions about the nature of the many different agreements that come before us. There are different types of agreement, and I shall answer his questions about why certain agreements were felt suitable for particular countries and circumstances. There are different ways of approaching our relations with third countries and there are different provisions within the European union's treaties that help to explain some of the differences. For example, some agreements can come exclusively within the competence of the European Union, especially those that arise strictly out of common commercial policies. Other agreements that have wider economic and political clauses become mixed agreements, under which they are partly within the competence of the European Union and partly within the competence of
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
member states. The larger-scale agreements, of which the Mexico agreement is a good example, must be scrutinised and ratified in national Parliaments, which focus on some of the areas that come within the competence of member states as well as that of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Windsor referred to confusion over the legal base with regard to the agreement with Mexico. I think that he is incorrect. If he has other information, he should let me know; the procedural disagreements and difficulties were over the agreement with Korea, which was more limited. At first it was wondered whether the agreement would fall within the treaty's bases on commercial and trading policy or whether it was wide enough to justify being based on article 235, which relates to wider mixed agreements. That has taken some time to sort out. It fits better within the mixed agreement than within the original, narrower interpretation. I am not sure whether there was any procedural difficulty with the Mexico agreement, but it has been dealt with within a shorter time scale than the Korea agreement. The Mexican agreement builds on an earlier agreement and was therefore a more straightforward process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Windsor asked about the opportunities and possible difficulties arising from the Korea agreement. He and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome spoke of the crisis in south-east Asia and how it has affected Korea and had repercussions for jobs and export possibilities in many constituencies. Korea has made much progress in coping with the crisis and now feels that the time is right to bring the agreement into force. It believes that the agreement will strengthen orderly trade and economic relations with important economic groupings in the world. We are happy with the agreement because it corresponds with current economic circumstances, and the Korean Government feel that it will benefit both sides. Shipbuilding was mentioned—an issue that has always been dear to my heart and to that of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark), who is present. We believe that the agreement is a step forward in bringing Korea into a more international framework for shipbuilding practices. Korea's commitment and ratification of the OECD shipbuilding agreement is a welcome step in that direction and it showed that it wants to work with us in eliminating unfair practises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Windsor mentioned trade and investment, which we believe will be helped by the agreement. We have a particular interest because, by some considerable margin, we have been the biggest recipient of investment from Korea and because we have a substantial trading relationship with Korea— the most important within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked about North Korea. It is not affected by the agreement and, for reasons that are familiar to us all, there is little contact between North Korea and the European Union. None the less, we have applauded the Korean Government's efforts in their sunshine policy to try to build up a relationship, despite the real and undoubted difficulties that there are. The only relevance of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
agreement is the ability for the European Union and Korea to discuss issues and look at possible ways forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Windsor asked about the benefit of the latest agreement with Mexico compared with earlier agreements. One of the benefits is that it creates fuller mechanisms, particularly for political and economic dialogue. In the creation of the joint council, in political matters and in the move towards a free trade agreement, it represents a considerable advance on the earlier agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trend</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For some time, negotiations have been continuing between the European Union and Mexico, which one wants to go well. Will the new agreement make that process different and better, and will the series of talks between the two parties continue until the resolution of the agreement? Problems with the agreement on South Korea were resolved before the agreement, but the Mexican agreement is being considered in the middle of a very difficult and protracted negotiation. Will the agreement help, or is it to run parallel and not come into force until the problem is solved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It helps because the institutional mechanisms provide for more regular and deeper dialogue. Other partnership and co-operation agreements have shown that the partner countries are able to work much more closely than under previous agreements. The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central, believes that his contacts with Mexico will be intensified as a result of the agreement and that the European Union's negotiating strength will help to move the process forward.

The hon. Members for Windsor and for Somerton and Frome, rightly, mentioned human rights. The human rights aspect of the agreement with Mexico was the focus of a recent debate in the European Parliament. Various organisations, including Oxfam, have expressed concern about human rights in

Mexico. However, as with all human rights difficulties, there often is a hard choice to make between saying, "We are not happy about human rights in particular areas so we do not want to enter into a closer agreement", and saying, "This closer agreement allows a much better framework within which the issues can be dicussed and therefore we feel it is better to adopt this approach." We have had discussions with opposition groups in Mexico, with civil society groups and with interested non-governmental organisations. It seems to us that the preponderance of opinion has been very much in favour of the agreement, despite the concerns that have been expressed. This is obviously an issue of concern to hon. Member and no doubt it will be raised in further discussion on the partnership and co-operation agreement.

Having attempted to answer those questions, I hope that the Committee will approve the orders and that we will be able to move forward to better relations with Korea and Mexico.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
