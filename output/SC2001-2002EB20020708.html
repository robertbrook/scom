	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development(Ms Sally Keeble)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to serve on the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the world summit on sustainable development, which will take place in August, and the European Union regulation on aid for poverty diseases. I am sure that we will have a substantial debate on those important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware of the criticisms that often accompany large international summits, but the world summit is an important event that can make a difference to international efforts to eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development. The Committee will also be aware of criticisms of the European Commission's development programmes. We should all clearly understand that the draft regulation on poverty diseases could be part of the answer to many such criticisms. The benefits of the work that it proposes will be focused strongly on the poorest countries and, as a recent report showed, the likely outcomes will have a major impact in the fight against poverty in those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will outline the Government's approach to the world summit before I talk about the European health regulation. In seven weeks' time, Ministers from across the world, including our Prime Minister, will meet in Johannesburg, South Africa, for the world summit, which is the culmination of an international process. The millennium summit in 2000 gave us the millennium development goals—a set of ambitious but achievable international targets that included the overarching goal of halving by 2015 the proportion of people living in poverty. In November last year, the Doha meeting of the World Trade Organisation placed the concerns of developing countries at the heart of the next trade round. In March this year, the Monterrey conference on finance for development led to pledges of increased development assistance from the European Union and the United States. Both meetings have been important steps in improving the effectiveness of the international system. The world summit in Johannesburg must build on those achievements. It provides an opportunity for world leaders to show the same willingness and resolve to work together in the fight against poverty as they showed in the fight against terrorism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The EU Development Council conclusions on preparations for the world summit on sustainable development stress the centrality of poverty reduction to the achievement of sustainable development. They emphasise the importance of completing successfully and on time the work launched under the Doha development agenda, the importance of increased official development assistance, and the need to ensure a successful third replenishment of the global environment facility. They also recognise that supporting African development is a high priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that the European health regulation is still being negotiated; it will be taken to the new General Affairs and External Relations Council later in the year. The United Kingdom has strongly supported the regulation. The landmark report of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, published last December, made it clear that the link between investment in better health and economic development and poverty reduction is far stronger than previously understood. The fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria—the three diseases on which the regulation focuses—is central to that effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation will provide the basis for the Commission's future contributions to the new global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. For the past year, the Commission has worked closely with the UK and other countries to ensure that the fund was set up as an innovative and effective public-private partnership to provide leverage and to allocate quickly substantial new resources to the fight against those three diseases. The Commission's continued contributions to and involvement in the fund will be important to its success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elements of the regulation include: work to promote better access to medicines in the poorest countries; work on differential pricing; work with the World Health Organisation to help Governments to make the best choices about selection and use of drugs; and funding for further research into vaccines and treatment. Work to help countries to monitor health outcomes better is also proposed. Overall, the regulation envisages a cross-cutting approach, bringing together development, trade and research sections of the Commission. It is looking to work in partnership with other international partners and in countries in a way that supports their Government programmes and priorities. The UK Government support that approach wholeheartedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues remain under negotiation. First, the European Parliament suggested changes that could be taken to misrepresent parts of the Doha declaration on TRIPS—trade related aspects of intellectual property rights—and public health. We all want rapid progress to be made on access to affordable medicines for the world's poor. Importantly, that declaration clarified a number of ways in which the TRIPS agreement could and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' right to protect public health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament amendments highlight some aspects of the Doha declaration, such as compulsory licensing, over others. That is unhelpful
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
and could serve to unpick that internationally agreed and broadly welcomed declaration. Furthermore, although we regard the elements that that Parliament has highlighted as important safeguards, it is clear to us that the best way to achieve widespread, sustainable and predictable access to medicines over a short time scale is to build support among all the key stakeholders for a package of measures on differential pricing. The United Kingdom has been working on that over the past year with the Commission and others through our working group on access to medicines. That group will report to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister at the end of the month, after which we will need to build further international support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There can be no interventions during the opening statement. There will be ample opportunity for questions later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our concern is that a European regulation that highlights compulsory licensing could be counter-productive. A number of member states share that view, which the Commission is referring back to the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other outstanding issue is the financial allocation. The letter of 2 July from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development outlined discussions about that issue to date; members of the Committee have copies of that letter. The UK continues to press for the regulation to be allocated an amount commensurate with its potential impact on poverty. If the budget council approves the budget package on 19 July, it will be for colleagues in the European Parliament to consider whether the financial allocation is adequate and to respond accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of us—member states, the Commission, the WHO and others—are working hard to build international consensus on access to medicines, which should result in substantial progress being made in the fairly near future. We recognise the urgency of the situation. The work of the UK working group should be a great asset in moving forward the international agenda. However, many member states, including us, feel that some of the European Parliament's proposed amendments might serve to unpick the Doha agreement and might be unhelpful to international progress. We understand that the Commission is referring member states' views back to the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to discussing these important issues with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is now an opportunity to ask the Minister questions, until 5·0 if necessary. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and put singly. If they wish to ask further questions, there should be ample opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. Before asking my brief and single-issue question, I join the Minister in welcoming you to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Do Her Majesty's Government have a view on the Khanbhai report of the European Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a note on that, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware of the terrible experiences of people in Africa and other countries who are dying, particularly of AIDS. Does my hon. Friend not find it uncomfortable to be discussing the rights of companies to patent and profit from medicines at the same time as millions are dying? Has that issue been raised in the discussions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of relevant issues. Clearly, the Government support the work of a number of states to combat HIV/AIDS and minimise its impact, particularly in Africa. To give the Committee an idea of the scope of the disease, in some parts of Africa, 60 per cent. of teacher recruitment is simply to replace those who die of AIDS. We are giving support to the health and HIV/AIDS programmes of different states. The time lag in the introduction of TRIPS is to ensure that developing countries can build up their own capacity and benefit from the international community's proposals. We want both a reduction in the incidence of AIDS and better treatment of the symptoms, and we are working with our international partners to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pursue that point a little further, would it not be a more productive approach to providing medicines to those who need them if Governments throughout the world were involved in joint research and production initiatives, in the same way as they collaborated in the war to counter terrorism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is partly what the documents are about, and our domestic working group is also working on access to medicines, so we are covering that in two forums. We must also ensure that, like other development work, the work to combat AIDS is sustainable, which means ensuring that developing countries have their own health systems in place so that the medicines get out to people and are used properly. Ensuring not only that medicines are provided to developing countries, but that they are delivered in a sustainable and long-term fashion, is a major issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boris Johnson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Henley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister twice used the Foreign Office codeword "unhelpful" to describe the European Parliament's amendments. Will she clarify how she finds the amendments unhelpful? In layman's language, to what aspects of the European Parliament's proposals do Her Majesty's Government object, and what is the relationship between that objection and what we are doing now? Will the Government veto the measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I talked about unhelpfulness, I was referring to the position taken by the European Parliament, and in particular some of the amendments that were proposed. The Government's view is that we have made progress through several major summits, especially those on development. A lot of work has been done on access to medicines and balancing that with patenting rights, and that work must be taken forward. We are concerned that efforts to go back to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the past and unpick some of the previous wordings and agreements could stall progress and prevent our reaching voluntary agreements that can carry the work forward. That is what we are working to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a nutshell, would it be fair to say that the European Parliament is trying to make it too hard for the pharmaceutical companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say that the European Parliament is trying to revisit the past whereas we want to move forward. We already have ways in which to take forward the agreements that have been made. We believe that consensus and voluntary agreements are the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pursue the same line as before, I am concerned about the slow pace of progress while people are dying. The phrase "fiddling while Rome burns" sounds trivial in the circumstances. Would it not be quicker if Governments directly took over research into and production of the specific pharmaceuticals that are designed to alleviate the symptoms and prevent death and disease?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help my hon. Friend if I differentiate the issues. There are issues of patenting, of pricing and of distribution. If the new drugs that are constantly needed are to be developed, people must be able to meet the costs of research and development; that raises patenting issues. I am sure that my hon. Friend recognises that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Distribution to developing countries is crucial. The Government are carrying out a great deal of work to secure agreements on differential pricing to ensure that drugs can be delivered to developing countries at realistic rather than high prices. One danger is that drugs sold at lower prices might leak back into more affluent markets; we must ensure that such leakage does not occur. However, we are making considerable progress on the crucial issue of pricing. We must get all three issues right if we are to develop the quantity of drugs needed at the price needed and secure the improvements that people in developing countries need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all share my hon. Friend's frustration at the high and sometimes increasing incidence of illness and its impact on developing countries. We are working hard to tackle those issues. Meanwhile, as well as providing projects from outside, we are encouraging developing countries to improve their health services through domestic health programmes. A great deal of work is in progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Julian Lewis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) correctly, bilateral assistance rather than assistance provided through the medium of EU institutions would be more profitable. I do not want to put words into his mouth, but I suspect that his view is based on other forms of aid given directly by the Department for International Development compared with aid channelled through European institutions. Is she confident that regulations proposed to tackle the AIDS pandemic, in which 3 million people are reported to have died last year, can be carried out
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
most profitably with the limited resources available through that route?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We continue bilateral work, but issues such as working with the pharmaceuticals industry should also be examined across Europe—and, indeed, globally. Many of the proposals outlined in the regulation build on the Commission's work under previous regulations, which showed considerable success. The effectiveness of the work has already been demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We and our international partners support specific health programmes. One important issue, particularly in respect of HIV/AIDS, is the need for strong political leadership and direction at local level. I could send the hon. Gentleman examples of countries in which that has proved successful. Tackling local governance issues has been a key part of this country's approach to development work. Dealing with patenting and pricing issues can be frustrating, but we are tackling health problems on a range of different fronts. The death rate is still too high, but we are securing some positive results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all welcome the initiatives, especially in the light of recent reports that life expectancy is dropping under the age of 30 in certain countries. Reference is made to the EU setting up a taskforce to explore innovative mechanisms for international financial solidarity in the context of global public goods. In other words, improvements should benefit not only the country where they are initiated, but neighbouring countries—indeed, perhaps the benefits should be global.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister have any idea what sort of innovative mechanism might be introduced? One thinks of the Tobin tax, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have notes about the European taskforce, which I understand is to be announced at the summit. I will write to my hon. Friend to ensure that he has the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Watkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that to further one of the objectives, to increase the affordability of key pharmaceuticals, financial support is to be given to a specific project
	<br><blockquote><p>"to improve pharmaceutical policies and practice, and help developing countries, at regional and national level, to develop high-quality local production of off-patent and/or licensed key pharmaceuticals".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say a little more about what progress that has been made towards that aim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the key issues. The hon. Lady might have noticed that the introduction of TRIPS in the poorest countries is delayed until 2016, to give them the chance to develop their own pharmaceuticals production capacity. She will be aware that at present such capacity is lacking, which is why those countries are reliant on imported products from developed countries. I cannot tell her precisely which industries are being developed locally and in which countries, although I will ensure that she is kept informed. There are 14 years yet to go on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the world summit on sustainable development, does the Minister agree that it is important to recognise that very different meanings attach to the term "sustainable development", depending on whether one looks at it from the point of view of an industrialised country, or a non-industrialised country? For example, it has been suggested that wealthy nations regard sustainable development policies as having to do with recycling, energy efficiency, conservation, and the rehabilitation of damaged landscapes, whereas for poorer nations they mean policies for equity, fairness, respect for the law, redistribution of wealth, and wealth creation. Does the Minister think that such widely divergent viewpoints create a danger that people will be talking on different wavelengths in the forthcoming summit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but, as I said, the summit is building on a number of previous meetings and commitments. There is a fairly good understanding among many world leaders about the development needs of developing countries, focusing particularly on the millennium development goals, especially poverty. Focusing on poverty is quite new, as is our commitment and that of the EU and others to do so by supporting the Governments of developing countries and making sure that they have some ownership of the development plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The papers from the EU set out a number of priorities, which include basic matters such as water and the use of natural resources and some of the governance issues; our proposals focus on those matters, too, so we will not be talking on different wavelengths. There is an increasing understanding of development needs and of the need for the development to be locally owned and sustainable in the longer term. The Government have done a great deal to foster that understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that some people, foremost among them Commissioner Patten, have expressed great concern about the misuse of a great deal of aid delivered through the EU, and about the fact that much of that aid has apparently gone missing? Rather than going to the people whom it was intended to help, it has disappeared to line somebody's pockets as a result of corruption and the lack of good governance in many of the recipient countries. If the Minister accepts that, do the Government have any plans to reconsider their previous insistence on delivering aid—UK taxpayers' money—from Government to Government through the EU, and to return to the policy of delivering a great deal of aid through charities and non-governmental organisations, which appears to ensure that far more of the money reaches those who need it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister answers that question, I should point out that the scope of debate is EU aid overseas and not EU allocations within the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone recognises the dangers of which Commissioner Patten warned. They are key matters that we must deal with. If hon. Members look at the current pattern of delivery of our aid, they will see that only 15 per cent. is delivered through Governments. The rest continues to go through
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
project aid, because those programmes are up and running. However, one could look at the amount of money that went into projects and ask what impact many of those projects had, and find that while they might have done some people some good at the time, they have not produced any institutional change and they have not provided the kind of sustainable development that the African countries need. They need to have year-on-year growth of between 5 and 7 per cent. if they are to achieve the millennium development goals and get rid of poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A massive change is needed. It is precisely the kind of issue that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) mentions that led the Government working with the EU to ensure that a good amount of the support that we provide goes into tackling governance issues; that is reflected in the statements that have come from the EU about the world summit. For example, the development of judicial and legal systems in Russia, of judicial systems in Uganda and Kenya, and of security reforms in Afghanistan will provide those countries with the institutions and frameworks that are needed, first, to ensure that our aid and European money get through and, secondly, to create the right climate to attract private sector investors. That combination, particularly the private sector investment, will in the long term provide a secure future for developing countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will not mind if I revert to the constitutional question. This is a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. The Minister said that there are European Parliament amendments that the Government find unhelpful. Can she make the current constitutional position clear to me? What can the Government do about those unhelpful amendments? On what basis is the regulation framed? Is it part of co-decision procedure or negative assent procedure? I cannot remember what they are all called and how it all works. Is rejecting the European Parliament's amendments now a matter for a majority vote in the Council; if so, who do the Government have on their side in the Council? Is the Minister confident of overturning the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the European procedures are byzantine. As I pointed out at the beginning, I understand that the Commission is to put the member states' views to the Parliament and a further vote will be taken. If the hon. Gentleman likes, I will give him a complete note detailing precisely the form that the votes will take, and when and where they will occur. We have made our views well known and a number of other states share our concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Several questions have been posed directly at the Minister. I have let them go, but I remind the Committee that questions should be posed through the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will see from the paperwork that the European Scrutiny Committee listed three conclusions of its own when it agreed to the report on the world summit on sustainable development. The second conclusion states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The depressing fact that the Conclusions highlight is that, despite a string of international conferences since Rio, the list of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
serious problems which need to be dealt with, urgently, seems to get longer and effective solutions are proving elusive."</p></blockquote>
What priority should be given to the various urgent problems? It is obvious that up to 3 million people dying every year should be given an overwhelming priority over almost everything else on the agenda combined. If she agrees, why does it not have that priority? If she does not agree, will she say why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman, his question is why health does not have the overwhelming priority because of AIDS. We are discussing two propositions—the world summit and the regulation on AIDS, TB and malaria. As he knows, the EU priorities include some health aspects while ours cover a different range of issues. Clearly, health is recognised. We certainly recognise that health is part of economic development. It must be strongly argued that achieving sustainable economic growth as well as tackling energy issues and access to resources are key to the longer-term well-being of developing countries and to ensuring that such countries meet the millennium development goal of halving poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health regulation clearly focuses on health. Some $2.1 billion will be given to the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and we aim to lever in more. That is a sign of the international community's serious intent to combat the risk that those three major diseases pose to the well-being and prospects of individuals in developing countries. The two issues under consideration have a slightly different focus, but that does not mean that we do not take health seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee must forgive me if I pursue again the question of authority. Will Parliament or the Council ultimately take the decision on the regulation that the Minister mentioned? She said that the Commission will let Parliament know the Council's views, but what will happen if Parliament does not agree with the Council? Is there a conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I must give the hon. Gentleman a procedural note on which has the final say and how the problems are resolved. It might help him to note that most European countries are coming round to our views. Austria remains the most vocal in pushing for unhelpful language around compulsory licensing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Watkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the comparison between the size of the financial envelope—in other words, the money available—to be devoted to the regulation, which will also cover the EU's contribution to the global fund, and the cost of the administrative processes that lead to the decision on how much goes into that envelope?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figure in front of me. Does the hon. Lady mean the €35 million provided for the cost of implementing the regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Watkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal is unlikely to be ready for adoption because of the size of the financial envelope. In other words, insufficient funding is
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
available for all the proposal's different elements. I am asking the Minister to compare the amount devoted to coalface services with the costs of EU administrative procedures underlying the decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it hard to comment on comparative costs, and as I said in my opening statement, some financing issues are still to be agreed. The pledges to the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria stand at $2.1 billion and those funds are going out to developing countries. We expect more donations as more pledges are received, but substantial sums are already getting there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seem to be no more questions, so we can debate the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 7727/2/02, draft Council Conclusions for the preparation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and No. 6863/02, draft Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on aid for poverty diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in developing countries; and welcomes the Government's approach to the World Summit and to discussions on differential pricing of medicines and other key issues. [
	<i>Ms Keeble.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>5.6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to her responsibilities. This is the first time that I have served on a European Committee with her, although I have already welcomed her in Westminster Hall and in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members acknowledge the good intentions of Governments throughout the EU, including Her Majesty's Government, in supporting continuing aid to deal with the scourge of disease across the developing world. However, as I intimated in a question to the Minister, we have grave reservations when so much aid fails to reach people in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When someone as eminent and experienced as Commissioner Patten expresses grave concerns about how much EU aid goes to line the pockets of corrupt people in various recipient countries, when so many people with generations of expertise affirm that Government-to-Government aid is not necessarily the best way to deliver it and when the European Scrutiny Committee states that the matter should be debated today because it is so "politically important", analysing the Government's position is crucial. Are the reservations about the European Parliament's approach rightly held and will the proposals help the people in greatest need in the most effective way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In several speeches and at international development Question Time over the past year or so, my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) has expressed our fear that many of Africa's problems are due to the lack of good governance. That does not mean that the developed world cannot provide considerable aid, but we must ensure that it is provided effectively. We are not convinced that the Government have it right, that the Government's right hand knows what the left hand is doing or even that the right and left hands agree with each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
On a number of occasions—I shall not detain the Committee by going into great detail—the Secretary of State for International Development has contradicted not only the Prime Minister's statements, but other Cabinet Ministers' statements at a time of international crisis. We are therefore entitled to question whether the Government always get these issues right and whether they always speak with a single voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly surprised that the Minister could not answer my question about the Khanbhai report, because the European Parliament refers to it in paragraph 11 of the report that we are discussing. Much good work has been done by people in the European Parliament, including my colleagues Bashir Khanbhai—a Conservative Member of the European Parliament from the East of England—and Nirj Deva, who was Member for Brentford and Isleworth from 1992 to 1997. He now represents South-East of England and is our European Parliament spokesman on international development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament adopted Bashir Khanbhai's report in 2001 and, more recently, accepted Nirj Deva's report on aid and the way in which multinational companies must play their part. Both men have been at the forefront of arguing that it is important, when aid is suggested, to have some security of good governance in recipient countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to questions from me and from my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden, Ministers have often said that they, too, are concerned about good governance, but they do not seem to have made the connection between the need for good governance, to which they always pay lip service at least, and us querying the fact that they constantly say that we are moving from aid via NGOs towards more Government-to-Government aid and more aid delivered through the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in constituencies such as mine, particularly those who work for major pharmaceutical companies that develop medicines that will be used to help the developing world, become concerned when they see that much of the aid that comes from their taxes does not necessarily help those who should be the recipients. There are two such companies in my constituency—Novartis and Eli Lilly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament has said that we must take greater account of concerns about pharmaceutical patents and so on, so it is not good enough for the Minister simply to say, "Well, we think that the European Parliament has got this completely wrong." There is much expertise in that Parliament. The matter involves not only history, but ensuring that the aid provided through our taxes and those of people elsewhere in the developed world gets to the right place and is used most effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many questions must be considered carefully, but Opposition Members certainly will not oppose aid to combat poverty diseases. We recognise, as does every Member from every party, the enormous problem being caused by the AIDS pandemic as well as the problem with economic development and ensuring
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
good governance in any country—particularly in Africa, but also elsewhere in the developing world—where so many of the population are stricken by AIDS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that there are at least two relevant pharmaceutical firms in his constituency. Now that an agreement has, I believe, been reached on differential pricing for drugs going to stricken third-world countries, have those firms said how they regard the options? Would they rather their drugs be supplied as a result of arrangements made Government to Government, or are they happy for the arrangements to be made through EU institutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to say that both companies try to stay away from matters of political and, in particular, party political controversy as much as they can. However, without referring to people by name, it is fair to say that in discussions with me and my friend and colleague in the European Parliament, Nirj Deva, individuals have expressed great concern about corruption and the fact that the move from supplying aid through charities and other NGOs is not helpful. It would not be wise of me to go further than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) enables me to remind the Committee of one controversy that was stirred up by the Secretary of State. In summer 1998, conflict and food shortages in Sudan left thousands of refugees in need of aid. In June 1998, she criticised the charities of the Disasters Emergency Committee for raising money for Sudan, and was quoted as calling their campaign "unnecessary". At the one world international media conference on 3 June 1998, she said that charities were "compounding compassion fatigue", which angered many people who spend their lives working for charities. Despite her words, the campaign, which was launched on 21 May that year, raised £10·5 million for a very good cause. Indeed, recipient countries are all grateful for the work done by charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other hon. Members may want to speak, and I do not want to take up the Committee's time. We shall not oppose the motion, but we wanted to place some concerns on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.16 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to pursue some of the themes of my earlier questions, but it would be unfair to ask the Minister to answer them because they are my own thoughts and have been given no other airing. Indeed, I expect my hon. Friend the Minister not to answer my comments, but to take them back to the committees on which she sits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point raised by the hon. Member for New Forest, East, we have discussed the delivery of EU aid in this Committee before, and we have concluded that the Department for International Development does a better job by delivering aid directly rather than passing it through the EU machinery. That is just in terms of efficiency, setting aside questions of corruption. I would have more confidence in DFID than in the EU. That is not a slur on the EU, but follows the inevitable fact that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
more machinery is gone through, the more wastage happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not my prime concern—my prime concern is that millions of people are facing death. We should all recognise that. It was even suggested this weekend that some communities are facing extinction because of the ravages of AIDS, and we cannot just sit around and talk about it for months or years while people die in those numbers. Something must be done, whether that is by individual Governments helping particular countries or by all the Governments of developed countries working together in a coalition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if we are to give money to help South Africa fight its AIDS problem, we should demand from the South African Government a recognition of the link between HIV and AIDS and a repudiation of the continual assertions by Thabo Mbeki to the contrary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there has been some movement on that point recently, but if the hon. Gentleman is prepared to wait a little, he will hear that I am not suggesting giving money. I shall come to that later. We are all aware of the obvious and established link between HIV and AIDS. The important thing is to get the drugs to those who are suffering from AIDS, or who are HIV positive but who have not yet developed AIDS. Governments are acting directly, especially the British Government: we have a good record of delivering on aid. That action may not be enough, but it is direct. We also have Commonwealth links with some of these countries, and a history of close links with many other countries as a result of our imperial past. We also have the advantage of language. We can do a good job, but we need to put more money and effort into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this were a war, Governments would not incentivise private companies to do their best to help people, but would act directly with Government employees—soldiers—to solve the problem. Indeed, Governments do that individually and collectively. We face a problem that requires a campaign of military proportions throughout the world. If we are serious about dealing with these issues, we must consider stronger Government involvement in research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also consider the direct commandeering of production to ensure that we produce enough of the necessary pharmaceuticals and deliver them cheaply, or even free of charge, to the countries that need them. As a modest economist, I appreciate the importance of differentiated markets with differentiated prices. One must insulate markets from each other. It is not beyond the wit of Governments and modern technology to tag pharmaceuticals so that they can be used only in those areas, and are immediately identifiable if they leak out of those markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as worried as some are about pharmaceutical companies. I am an old-fashioned socialist, and I remember the days when we talked about public ownership of the pharmaceutical industry, although we are some way from that at this point. The hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
laughs. Perhaps he is not as old as I am and does not remember those days, but I do. There is a case for direct Government involvement in the provision of the necessary pharmaceuticals to those poor countries. It will delay, not solve, the problem if we go through EU machinery and try simply to incentivise private producers to deliver by protecting their profits and their patent rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When history is written and future generations look back, they will ask why we did nothing, but just let things happen. Were we simply protecting the sensitivities of the free market and global corporations, or were we seriously concerned about the people being infected and dying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman support the European Parliament amendments to the regulations to give effect to compulsory licensing for the drugs in southern Africa and elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That strikes me as a step in the right direction. However, I would go further, and urge other countries to do the same. Governments should not wait for amendments to a directive, but should take direct action and persuade other Governments to do the same. They should not to be too sensitive to the resistance of pharmaceutical companies who might be more interested in protecting their profits, licences and patents than in saving the lives of millions of people. The problem will get worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the weekend, there was much publicity about the problem of AIDS, which was close to home. In fact, it came to my home. I recently noticed the significant increase in the number of African immigrants coming to live in Luton, and I wondered why. One reason why people try to get to Britain appears to be that they can get drugs here that they cannot get there. They face almost certain death if they are HIV positive, or have developed AIDS, and are forced to return to Africa. Here, they at least have the possibility of acquiring the necessary drugs. Last night, it was suggested on the "Panorama" programme or on Channel 4 news that some doctors are prescribing these drugs even though they perhaps should not. They are doing so because they are humane people and are trying to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the earlier part of his speech too far behind, let me make a point. I am interested that one agency that he did not mention was the United Nations. The UN has a grave concern about the pandemic and I would have thought that for the quasi-military campaign of supply of drugs that he has in mind, it would be the appropriate relief organisation, as it was after previous forms of holocaust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that sensible suggestion. My one worry is that the UN is often hamstrung by lack of funds and by a lack of support from certain Governments. In a sense, some developed countries could take a lead and pull the UN with them. I agree entirely that we should use the UN as best we can to promote what I am suggesting. I should point out that these are only thoughts that arose today as I read through the papers. They are not a political initiative that I have developed before. It just occurs to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
me that we must do something much more serious than we are now contemplating if we are to solve the problem of the millions of people who are dying and are likely to die in Africa and elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I correctly divined that the hon. Gentleman was coming towards the end of his remarks, but before he moved too much further on, I wanted to say that I hope that despite his remarks about pharmaceutical companies and their profits he will pay tribute to the huge work of their scientists in developing the drugs that have already been widely used in the developing world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I recognise the contribution that pharmaceutical companies and their scientists have made to the world. We have made some advances. But pharmaceutical companies are not beyond criticism, even in the work that they have done. They are commercial companies. They are trying to make profits. They will act as commercial companies do to try to maximise their profits in the way that they sell their products. Direct Government involvement has a role to play here. If the pharmaceutical companies have to be constrained in some way or used by Government, so be it. I want to say no more than that. We need direct Government involvement and the UN would be a useful route too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.27 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene, but in view of the interesting comments by earlier speakers, I want to make a couple of points. I declare an interest in that I continue to advise my former company, Novartis. It is a pharmaceutical company although, as far as I know, it is not involved with AIDS drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree about the gravity of the situation. It is possible to spend too much time debating the relative virtues of different bodies for delivering aid because in reality it often turns out to be either the same or very similar people involved in the delivery. We all have our favourites. Some of us like the EU, some of us like bilateral aid, some of us like the United Nations and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North said, the issue is urgent and the answer has to be to push ahead on all fronts as fast as possible. I have two points to make following his speech. Because of the sheer intensity of the crisis we are perhaps losing sight of the old adage that prevention is better than cure. In the efforts made by the European Union, by Britain bilaterally and by the UN we need also to stress that, as much as we attempt to deal with those who have already been infected, the AIDS pandemic can be contained by prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, important though the debate on the price of drugs is, it needs to be linked to the debate on the delivery of the treatment. It is a mistake to think that that if only we supplied millions of pills, the problem would be solved. That leads us to the longer-term programmes of the EU, the WHO and Britain in bilaterally building up health care infrastructures in the countries concerned. I hope that in her discussions with her European colleagues the Minister will keep that aspect in mind as well as pushing the urgency of the whole issue, as all hon. Members have stressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support one aspect of the speech of the hon. Member for Luton, North. It was an interesting contribution, particularly as he has a general prejudice in favour of bilateral aid, as opposed to EU aid or multilateral aid. It is not that one should be against EU aid, or of aid being provided through multinational institutions, but my experience is that the bilateral system works best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak as one who had the benefit a few months ago of visiting South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe to see what is happening there in the struggle against AIDS. I have seen what NGOs are doing to prevent the spread of AIDS and its transmission from mother to child in the womb; and remarkable success has been brought about by hard working NGOs in reducing the infectivity rate in Uganda—from one in five or 10 to about one in 20. It is a considerable reduction. For Uganda, that is thanks largely to the donations of the Government. The UK is the biggest single bilateral donor to Uganda. There is also a political spin-off: we are also Uganda's biggest single trading partner. That is the best way to do it, because people have a clear idea of who is in charge and who is accountable.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what it is, Mr. O'Hara; I long ago decided that some of the hon. Gentleman's contributions sounded as if they could have come from a Liberal Democrat. That may have sowed the confusion in my mind. I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the Committee will indulge me in my mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite my false ascription to the hon. Gentleman of Liberal Democrat thinking, one of the sensible things that he said was that in the end it is the same old people who tend to do the job. That is profoundly true, regardless of whether it is the EU or the UK that gives the money; even UNICEF money goes to the same sort of micro—NGOs. Nevertheless, it is far better that the Department for International Development, which is very good, should have a direct sense of accountability; it is dispensing taxpayers' money, and the people on the ground know that they are accountable to the Department, which is big in South Africa. It is surprising, for one who grew up believing that Britain's world role had shrunk, to go to South Africa and find that we are a very big player and they take us very seriously. They listen to what the people from DFID have to say and the people from DFID ensure that British taxpayers' money is wisely spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure if the same can be said about EU funding and the EU representatives in Africa and other parts of the world. They try hard and they do a good job, but I am not convinced that their work is as effective as bilateral aid. The old rule concerning multinational money is that because it is everybody's money it is nobody's money. People do not have quite
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
the same sense of accountability and responsibility when dealing it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fascinating example of such wooliness and vagueness about authority and who is in charge was provided by the description of the regulation given to the Committee this afternoon. With the greatest of respect to the Minister, I asked several times exactly who was in charge of this amendment to beef up the regulation. The European Parliament has decided that there should be compulsory licensing for these drugs. It is in rather the same frame of mind as the hon. Member for Luton, North—it wants to stick it to the pharmaceutical companies and ensure that they dish out the drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, no doubt for sound tactical reasons, want a voluntary system and want the European Parliament to think again. However, it is absolutely unclear what will happen. Listening to the Minister and everybody else, it is totally unclear to me who is in charge of the amendment and how the matter will ultimately be resolved. That is a classic example of the wooliness and vagueness that characterise EU-type operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and forgive his absent-mindedness. Is not his criticism of what is essentially the consensus mechanism of the EU, which requires an agreement between different bodies before progress can he made, a little strange set beside his enthusiasm for aid administered through NGOs? With all credit to the NGOs, and they vary a great deal in quality, they are not accountable to anybody except to those who sit on their boards. We are debating what the European Union ought to be doing, and the European Parliament also debates what the EU ought to be doing. If we are spending money on this, should we not have some say in how it is spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My criticism is not of the NGOs, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said. It is of the European Union institutions and their representatives—the emanations of the EU in Africa, which do not do quite as good a job of overseeing the spending of taxpayers' money as the Department for International Development. That is why, like the hon. Member for Luton, North, I think we should be prejudiced in favour of giving aid bilaterally through DFID.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was perplexed, so I am grateful that the hon. Member for Broxtowe was able to reveal to me that there is a consensus mechanism at work. That is a very exciting thing that I did not know about. However, I am still unclear, despite his elucidation, exactly who will be in charge, where the buck stops in the consensus mechanism and whether the European Parliament or the Council of Ministers is sovereign in this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing is certain—this House will not be sovereign in it, and neither will Her Majesty's Government. That is the core of my objection. If we are to embark on a programme, it would be far better for us to have complete control over it and the ability to oversee its final delivery to the people who need it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly no expert on the subject of our debate, but I know a bit about history and past holocausts. When American forces overran such concentration camps as Belsen, Buchenwald and Dachau, they found to their horror tens of thousands of people in their final extremity. That terrible problem was tackled with a degree of single-mindedness that could be used to inform today's debate. The hon. Member for Luton, North hit the nail on the head in his recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No committees or international negotiations were involved in tackling that horrifying problem; instead, the medical forces of individual countries— principally, general practitioners and others from this country—immediately went to the scene of the disaster and administered help directly. A little later, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was involved in direct handling of the problem, coordinating efforts on a longer-term basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In preparing for today's debate, I was shocked by some of the briefing material that I was given. For example, an article in the 
	<i>British Medical Journal</i> states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Aids will surpass the Black Death as the world's worst pandemic if the 40 million people living with HIV/Aids do not get life-prolonging drugs."</p></blockquote>
It is difficult to see how the deliberations of solemn parliamentarians in their assemblies will lead to the direct application of the emergency assistance that is required, even with the best will in the world. I leave aside the anti-European Union prejudices that some of us may entertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that significant progress has recently been made in resolving the litigation involving the companies that researched and developed the drugs. It is impossible to expect scientific firms to research and develop drugs if they know that the products of their research will be sold on for a price that covers only production costs, with no allowance made for their huge investment in urgently developing cures for diseases. If drugs companies, including some in this country, have succeeded in developing drugs that will contain a disease and prevent its spread to future generations, it is difficult to understand why we must go through a roundabout route, via international and European institutions, to get those drugs to those who require them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is especially true in an environment in which the application of money to a problem tends to be inefficient, to put it mildly. One cannot be confident that anything like all the money pumped in will reach the destination for which it was intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many of the hon. Gentleman's comments. My mother worked for United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and I know how effectively the post-war crisis was dealt with. I agree with his recommendation. However, we are not in a zero-sum game here. We are debating not whether money should go through the European Union or Britain, but whether the European Union should take action. Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that it should not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying, in endorsement of the comments of the hon. Member for Luton, North, is that in this situation money is not what is needed. What is needed is the direct application of drugs that are the only hope for millions of people who are under sentence of death. I would feel happier if I knew whether the aid proposed to tackle the terrible prospect of millions more dying was aid in kind—direct aid in the form of drugs, not money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Does he not also agree that, in the long run, it might be cheaper for developed nations to provide pharmaceuticals—even for free—than to provide financial aid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be not only cheaper but far more effective, because such aid cannot be creamed off and has a better chance of reaching its destination. Perhaps the EU, the UN or individual Government specialist committees should deliberate how chemical plants could be developed and subcontracted in other countries so that the drugs could be supplied domestically, more directly, instead of people having to wait for the largesse of international society before the drugs can be delivered to where they are needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening again, but is the hon. Gentleman not in danger of overlooking all the infrastructure issues? I agree that it is better to send drugs than money to buy drugs, but building the necessary infrastructure to enable drugs to be delivered sensibly can be done only by the countries themselves, on the spot, and they will need money to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I catered for that slightly longer-term aim in my remarks about the need for local development in such countries in the medium to long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help wondering why we have such a relaxed, laid-back attitude to the current terrible crisis; that was not the case at the end of the second world war. There are two possible explanations. The first, which I dismiss, is that it results from latent racialism. There seems to be a belief in some quarters that because the crisis affects people of a different ethnic origin from ours in terribly poor countries where there is a history of people dying well before their time, it is more acceptable than if it were happening in a Caucasian nation where people have a lifespan typical of westerners. I am more inclined to think, however, that it is a matter not of racialism but of geography.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The countries that we are discussing are not on our doorstep; they are far away. The concentration camps were not. Today, it is easier for people to make a gesture by giving a donation and then to turn the page. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Broxtowe indicate his agreement from across the political divide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest another reason why we do not take the crisis in Africa as seriously as we might? There is no longer any geopolitical interest in Africa. The cold war is over and neither the United States nor the Soviet Union directly supports one side or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. I must be careful not to stray too far from the central point of the debate, but if that is the case, it is a shortsighted view for geopoliticians in western capitals to take, because such an attitude contains all that is necessary to create precisely the sort of failed and imploded states that have become bases for the sort of terrorism that we saw only a few months ago. The west has turned its back on other countries once they cease to be relevant to great power conflicts, and we have paid the price. Humanitarian considerations apart, it is in our interests to look after the countries that are suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to spend a few moments considering the statistics because, frankly, I find them almost unbelievable. I am told that AIDS has killed 25 million people since the early 1980s, and that an estimated 14,000 people are infected each day with HIV. A further possibility occurs as to why people do not tackle the problem of HIV/AIDS with the same anxiety and urgency as they do death and destruction inflicted deliberately by a foreign power. In this country, HIV is associated with sexual activity and drug abuse; on the sub-continent of Africa, we associate it less with drug abuse than with sexual activity. We are constantly told that the answer is education, but that betrays a lack of urgency in the face of a holocaust occurring day by day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is on a theme similar to that of my questions to the Minister. I find it hard to get my head around the key priorities selected for action at the world summit on sustainable development. We are told that those priorities are water and sanitation, energy for sustainable development, natural resources such as fisheries and forestry, education, governance and global public goods, whatever those may be. If we considered those problems in detail, we would find that most were recurring themes in any debate in any forum on international development and world poverty in any decade since the end of the second world war. I find it hard to appreciate how we can seriously talk about them as key priorities when millions of people are dying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech with which I agree. There has been a great deal of press coverage in the run-up to the international conference in Johannesburg, as there was for those in Monterrey and Rio and especially for the preparatory summit in Bali. Has he received letters similar to those that my constituents send to me asking why world statesmen have to fly to such attractive destinations, given that the issues they discuss are those of grinding poverty? As one of my constituents put it, why should the preparation not be done in Barking rather than Bali?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to go down the route to which my hon. Friend directs me, but I will resist the temptation. He made the point sharply in his own way, and people will have understood it without further elaboration from me. I do not want to prolong the debate unduly, and I will draw my remarks to a close shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something desperate is happening minute by minute, hour by hour, and day by day. Imagine that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I were a representative of a non-governmental organisation that worked on the ground, and that I had seen people dying at that rate. Imagine—it is a rather unlikely scenario—that I were a representative of one of the communities so desperately afflicted with the diseases. Then imagine that I were sitting at the back of the Room listening to us trying to discuss the problem in terms of institutional arrangements for long-term organisation of relief and priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were such a person, I would begin to wonder whether what I heard was at all directly engaged with what was happening. We are in one of those terrible situations in which we almost want to give the legislators a direct view and say, "See for yourself. This is what is happening. Having seen it, can you really be content with indirect arrangements rather than direct remedies?" The hon. Member for Luton, North outlined one such remedy in his impressive speech. The prospect would be daunting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I opened with a reference to the liberation of Buchenwald, Belsen and Dachau. It might be as well to close by reminding the Committee that in 1945, when Buchenwald was liberated, Parliament sent a delegation to see what had happened. Among the group was a woman MP called Mavis Tate. What she saw so horrified her that subsequently she took her own life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that if any of us were transported to see what is happening on the ground on the scale that has been described, he would be desperately traumatised. We are, fortunately, not in that position, but we would like to hear from the Minister what the objections are to the quasi-military direct aid project proposed by a Labour Back Bencher and supported to a considerable extent by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Ms Sally Keeble)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions and for the serious discussion that has taken place. Eliminating poverty is probably the most urgent task that we face. If we do not get it right, the number of people living in poverty in certain countries will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject absolutely the suggestion of the hon. Member for New Forest, East that we are turning our backs on the problem because it is in Africa. The Government have been instrumental in putting Africa on the international agenda. It was the Prime Minister who said that Africa was a scar on the conscience of the world, and nobody would disagree with that. We have continually pressed the case for extra aid for Africa, and for half of the Monterrey money to go to Africa. We have also increased the amount that we provide in aid by some 50 per cent. from a low of 2.6 per cent. of gross national product when we entered office to 3.2 per cent., rising to 3.3 per cent., and we have pledged £1 billion of that money for Africa. I could make cheap party political points, but they have been made very often before. Suffice it to say that we have not turned our backs on the developing
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
world, certainly not in the way that has been insinuated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two issues being discussed have become somewhat confused: they are the world summit and, separately, the regulation. I shall deal with some of the procedural points raised by the hon. Member for Henley because I have miraculously received a note about them. We have taken important steps in the past year, both at Doha and at Monterrey, in improving the effectiveness of the international system. We see the summit at Johannesburg as an opportunity to build on that and ensure that we continue to work in a co-ordinated manner. Developing countries have suffered far too much from western nations' passing fashions in development. We need to maintain steady and consistent progress, working with them on sustainable development. It is in that context that discussions about TRIPS take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to confuse that issue with the EU regulation with which the European Parliament has had problems. That is extremely straightforward—it is about putting money into the global fund to combat disease. Everyone who has spoken in the debate said that we should do that and that it is an outrage that we do not put in more. Hon. Members should not let their dislike of Europe or their frustration with European procedures stand in the way of their recognition that giving money to fight AIDS, malaria and TB is a wholly good project and worthy cause. I cannot imagine that anyone here would want to prevent that from happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath returned to the issue of governance. I completely agree with him, and I have already set out how a considerable amount of our bilateral aid is allocated to deal with governance issues. That is the case because there is no point setting up little projects around a country and ignoring the fact that the Government of that country is incapable of providing quality public services or the security and systems that people need for their day-to-day lives and which the private sector needs if it is to invest in the developing world. I am sure that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath has heard often that a small change in tariffs would produce $150 billion extra in investment, which is three times what the developed world spends in aid, so a great deal more is at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put in a lot of work and we have also been providing direct budgetary support to Governments, which gives us leverage in discussions with them. We have withheld £15 million of direct budgetary support for Kenya because of the Kenyan Government's failure to honour their commitments to deal with governance issues. As hon. Members may have read in the press, intense discussions are taking place on the pressure that this country is putting on Kenya to resolve issues relating to its own governance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a good point about leverage. Does she agree that it is important to keep the cards in the hands of national Governments, as it is often difficult to exert the same leverage through the Council owing to the difficulties of getting a collective decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but it is excellent that the EU spends some of its vast budget on the developing world. We have increased the support that we provide, whether through direct budgetary support for Governments or through projects with NGOs and the like. As I said at the outset, about 15 per cent. of our direct support is provided through direct budgetary assistance and 85 per cent. through other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some governance problems are not solely of the developing countries' making. We have successfully provided support for cheap textbooks for schools in Africa, which is valuable and important. Unfortunately, it has not provided best value for money, partly because of scams run by British publishers, which have inflated the prices. That is a major problem and the measures that had to be taken in Uganda to tackle it included involving the monitoring groups responsible for the selection of the publishers for the textbooks in an SAS-style operation to prevent them from being interfered with by the publishers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fault does not always lie with the developing countries. Some of our own publishers played a role in making less effective an extraordinarily important development project conducted by the Government with money from the British taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, my hon. Friend reinforces my point that direct Government involvement in the pharmaceutical sector is required to ensure that the companies do what they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could not publish all the textbooks ourselves, although that is a separate matter. I shall return to the pharmaceuticals issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath made a point about the Secretary of State annoying some NGOs. I am sure that Members who have travelled through developing countries will have encountered the glowing support given to this country and, especially, to my right hon. Friend owing to the fact that she has championed developing countries. She has raised development's profile not only in this country, but internationally, and she has pressured other Governments into supporting development goals, for which she succeeded in getting extra money from our Government. In the light of those facts, the hon. Gentleman's criticism on NGOs is misguided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to take up the Committee's time with details, but I should point out that our working group dealing with access to medicine includes representatives of GlaxoSmithKline. I am not sure whether that company operates in the area to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The working group also includes the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, so industry is closely involved in working with the Government on differential pricing. He also referred to Novartis, which provides differential prices for a drug to treat malaria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North was clear about his commitment and the depths of his concern. His criticisms of EU aid were well made, and many would share them, but our concern is to ensure that the EU focuses its aid on the needs of the poorest
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
and does not provide aid to more affluent countries for geopolitical reasons. That is what the hon. Member for New Forest, East described, and we all share his sense of urgency on dealing with illnesses and easing suffering. However, he may want to think more carefully about the mechanics of achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envy the hon. Member for Henley his opportunity to visit countries such as Uganda, where the incidence of HIV/AIDS was halved over 10 years through a variety of measures—one was the political lead and commitment from the Ugandan Government in tackling the problem. Senegal has also tackled it, and even Kenya has managed somewhat to stabilise the incidence, although its efforts are at an early stage. The role of Mbeki shows that money is not the only consideration; people must front up to other issues if the incidence of AIDS is to be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the changes in the illness. In many countries, mother-to-child transmission is the main source of infection, which is a tragedy, but it is a mistake to minimise the problems of distribution, because we must sustain delivery beyond one generation. We cannot immunise a population once only—we must keep on doing it. That is a major issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the example of an unannounced visit that I made to a clinic in Kenya, where the drugs and syringes were provided free. The clinic made a service charge alone. However, when I asked where the vaccines were kept, I was shown a fridge, but I was then told that there had been no electricity for a month. The vaccines were kept in the kind of coolbox that we give our children to take their lunch to school on a hot day. To deny that there are substantial issues, not only of cost and provision but of distribution and the country's health service, is to underestimate the problem. I do not want to detract from what hon. Members have said, but we must take the big problems seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's point about distribution is well made, although it was originally put by the hon. Member for Broxtowe. Will she please address the central point made by hon. Member for Luton, North, which is that we will get a better result if the aid is channelled in the form of drugs rather than as simple financial assistance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what point is being made. Even if we ship a lot of drugs out to those countries, the distribution problems will remain. If we provide the money, the drugs can be sourced at a lower price in the developing countries or bulk purchased elsewhere. The three key issues are the cost of the drugs, access to them—there must be enough in the countries concerned—and distribution. On the first two, we are dealing with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North about nationalised production, but I doubt whether the hon. Member for New Forest, East, knowing his political position, is advocating that. I think that he was talking about drugs versus money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way once again. That is a component of what I was suggesting, but only that, as it would ensure that the Government had control of the supply of drugs.

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Portable refrigeration units could be delivered at the same time as the drugs, and then sufficient supplies could be delivered as the drugs would not break down or run out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that there are a lot of issues. One is storage, which is a notorious problem. Another is that although one can provide something free, service charges could be a problem if the governance issues are not sorted out. There are other difficulties. For instance, in some areas the nurse has to wait until the mother brings the child, and there is the question whether the service is provided through outreach or in local clinics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, who has particular knowledge of European procedures and of the drugs industry, raised a number of points. I agree with him on prevention, which is of major importance with AIDS, as Africa is in the lull before the storm. The death rates are not yet high and people are living with it, but the real problem is that some AIDS orphans are infected. Many thousands of children are growing up with one or both parents dead from AIDS. The incidence of AIDS has hit some countries hard, particularly in public services such as education and health. It is crucial to reduce its incidence, which means dealing with people's behaviour, not just the symptoms of the illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Henley gave us an interesting description of his travels. My note says that he was right about the procedures. I shall read out a little of it, but if he wants more, I shall write to him in detail. There needs to be agreement between the Council and the European Parliament, which is a co-decision process, and negotiations are ongoing. That will lead, if necessary, to the formal conciliation process. If there is no success at all, the regulation will not be agreed and it will be unable to proceed. That outcome would be a complete tragedy, because the regulation would make it possible to provide the money for the global fund. I hope that that deals with the hon. Gentleman's concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so grateful to the Minister for dealing with the procedural question. It seems that the nub of it is that the Council has the final say, and that the matter falls without agreement. Will she clarify exactly what the Government object to in the Parliament's amendments? Is it that third-world countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe should have licences to produce drugs? Paragraph (i) on page 8 of the regulation states that the Council will
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage capacity building in developing countries, to enable them to co-ordinate, host and conduct large-scale population trials".</p></blockquote>

measures. It is in no one's interests to reopen and unpick an internationally agreed declaration. The amendments give prominence to compulsory licensing, but our approach is based on achieving agreement and on an action plan that will introduce a voluntary differential pricing system as the operational norm. That approach has the potential to bring medicines to the poor in developing countries on a more widespread and sustainable basis. We oppose the amendments because they would not help us make progress in that regard. I hope that that clarifies our position.

The hon. Member for Henley also asked about bilateral as opposed to multilateral aid. We still provide bilateral aid, some of which goes directly to Governments, as we discussed, while some goes through NGOs and is project based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some misunderstanding about the purpose of the regulation, and the hon. Member for New Forest, East implied that we are being mealymouthed and woolly about wanting to go ahead with it. However, it is under the regulation that we shall contribute to the global fund, which already provides 40 programmes in 30 countries. It has provided $378 million over two years, and we have pledged $200 million over five years. The Commission's continued contributions and involvement in the fund are obviously important for its success, and that is what the regulation is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, however, is not all that the international community is doing on health. We and other donors provide bilateral help, and there is a clear need for coordination between donors. There is also the global polio eradication initiative. That international partnership was launched in 1988 and it is making considerable progress, with the support of Governments, NGOs, UN agencies and others. In that regard, I thought that we would be criticised because the regulation mentions only three of the diseases that have ravaged developing countries, when other, preventable diseases have done so too.

The hon. Member for New Forest, East asked why water is such a priority. The reason is that many people get sick because of bad water supplies. We are therefore considering such issues and taking active steps to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that he cannot not understand why natural resources are such a priority for the world summit, but 75 to 80 per cent. of people in the poorest countries live in rural areas and they depend on natural resources or fishing for their livelihood. Logging that is carried out to suit the developed world's needs and extensive fishing off the coast of Africa have an excruciating impact on those people. We should deal with the priorities identified by the EU, most of which are also the Government's priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will continue to work with other member states and the European Commission to ensure that there is a successful outcome at the world summit. Doha and Monterrey have given us a strong platform on which we must build.

The debate has clearly shown the importance of the proposed regulation on aid for poverty diseases. As everyone in Committee has said, it is crucial that we combat those illnesses. It is also clear that the Commission is well placed to make an invaluable contribution to that by providing money for the global fund. The Government will continue to press for the regulation to be appropriately resourced, although the views of our colleagues in the European Parliament in coming weeks will be critical in determining the final allocation. I hope that that deals with all the points that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
