	<div class='legislation'>Draft Education Reform Act 1988 (Application of Section 122 to Institutions in Wales) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education Reform Act 1988 (Application of Section 122 to Institutions in Wales) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
Public sector higher education in Wales was last debated three years ago, in the debates on the Education Reform Bill. At that time, it fell to me to explain to hon. Members why it was decided to follow a different path for the Welsh local authority colleges from that taken in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh public sector of higher education—or the non-university higher education sector as we are increasingly corning to call it—is small. Three years ago there were 14,000 students in that sector in Wales, although that number has now risen to 16,000. That has shown that our higher education policies are working. Only six institutions, including our one voluntary college—Trinity college, Carmarthen—were large enough to meet the criteria then established for incorporation and funding by the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council, the PCFC. The small size of our local athority sector and the good relations that existed then—and still, I hope, exist today—between the Welsh Office and the local education authorities, made it considerably easier to plan than the much larger English sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise that the good relations between the Department and the LEAs, and the smooth working of the Wales advisory body which resulted from them, were a major factor leading to the decision to leave our higher education institutions in the local authority sector when the English polytechnics and colleges were being made independent bodies. At that time, the factors pointing towards independence for the Welsh colleges—and there were some—were outweighed by the success of the Wales advisory body and the good relationships with the local authorities that existed in Wales. Nevertheless, while deciding to leave our higher education institutions in the local government sector, we took care to ensure that the options for the future were left open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that was three years ago, and during those years relationships between some of the colleges and their maintaining authorities have been uneasy. Colleges have resented their lack of independence, compared with their English and Scottish counterparts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Members will know that reconsideration of the position of the non-university colleges as a whole was prompted by the report of Price Waterhouse and Co. on the polytechnic of Wales, which is our largest non-university institution of higher education. With almost 5,300 full-time equivalent students, made up of 5,000 full-time and 1,500
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
part-time students enrolled, the polytechnic is larger than all the colleges of the university of Wales, except the University college of Cardiff, The Price Waterhouse report recommended that the best future for our polytechnic lay in granting it independent status and direct Welsh Office funding, It also recognised that, because the polytechnic forms such a large part of our non-university sector, that recommendation carried implications for the other higher education institutions, although the consultants' terms of reference precluded them from making recommendations about the future of those other institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultants' report was received in May last year, when my right hon Friend told the House that there would be wide consultations on the recommendations. In those consultations I met the parties most affected face to face. It transpired that among the people most directly affected—those in the LEAs and in the institutions—there was no consensus on the best way forward for non-university higher education in Wales. The LEAs, without exception, wished all the maintained institutions of higher education to remain in the local government sector, despite the fact that, at an earlier stage, Mid Glamorgan county council had asked my right hon Friend to take over responsibility for the polytechnic, On the other hand, majority opinion in the institutions and their governing bodies was clearly in favour of independent status for the institutions, with Welsh Office funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were, however, two points on which opinion was unanimous, No one wanted to create a situation in which the polytechnic had a different status from the other colleges, and no one thought that the Welsh institutions should become the responsibility of the PCFC. Those two points emerged from the consultation. There was a consensus that the character and identity of the Welsh non-university higher education sector should be preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as considering the results of that consultation, account has been taken of the experience of the English institutions, which were given their independence in the PCFC in April 1989, and the experience of the Scottish sector. The equivalent institutions in Scotland have had independent status and have been funded by the Scottish Education Department for many years. There is no doubt that English institutions have flourished since 1989. We make no apology for being much influenced by the evidence of the benefits that independence has brought them in the past two years, and the calmer waters in which the central institutions of Scotland sail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In weighing the evidence, we have had the interests of one group of people in the forefront of our minds—that is, of course, the students. Our objective is to establish a framework that will give the widest possible opportunities and the highest possible quality of higher education to the future generations of students, both those from Wales who wish to study in their home country and those from other parts of the United Kingdom and from overseas who choose to study in the Principality. It is their interests that should carry the day, and not, if they conflict, the interests of institutions or authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all the evidence, and the best information available on the likely future trends in higher education—such as modular courses, transbinary co-operation, changes in the demands for courses, the need for ever-increasing links with industry—we have concluded that the best interests of the students, and of the institutions that exist to provide their higher education, lie with independent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
status for the institutions with funding from the Welsh Office. To assist the Department in its funding responsibility we shall establish a small advisory group, to which we shall look for expert advice. We believe that that is the right way forward, rather than independence with funding by the PCFC, an option that is open to us but which has been rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the local authorities that, over the years, have brought our higher education institutions into existence and nurtured them to the position they have now reached, where they can stand on their own feet and face the world without the protection afforded by the parent LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, can the Minister tell us whether all colleges will go the same way as the polytechnic, and will they all go that way at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I thought that I had made it clear that the Price Waterhouse report stated that there were implications for the remainder of the sector. When deciding to fund the polytechnic direct, we also decided that it would be in the best interests of the other institutions to be funded direct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The colleges are the children of the LEAs and, like all children, they have grown under the benevolent wing of their parents to a size and maturity at which they can lead their own independent lives. It is to the credit of the local authorities that the polytechnic of Wales and the major colleges have reached that position. I hope that, on reflection, the LEAs will accept that the decision to incorporate those institutions and set them on a path of independence is the right decision for the institutions, and especially for the students who will come to them in future years. The colleges will continue to be an important resource in their own localities after independence, and the LEAs will be represented on their governing bodies. I hope very much that colleges and LEAs will continue to work together as equal partners to the benefit of those who live and work in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order under section 227(4) of the Education Reform Act 1988 will not effect any changes to the institutions. Its purpose is to give my right hon. Friend the power to establish higher education corporations to conduct institutions of higher education that meet the criteria for incorporation laid down in the Act. The institutions that fully meet those criteria are the polytechnic of Wales, the Cardiff and West Glamorgan institutes of higher education, the Gwent college of higher education and Bangor normal college. The Welsh college of music and drama in Cardiff does not fully meet the criteria, but may be incorporated with the agreement of the maintaining authority. I am glad to say that South Glamorgan county council has given its agreement and that the college of music and drama is therefore eligible for incorporation with the other colleges. If the draft order is approved by the House and in the other place, the power will be used to make a second order, under section 122(1) of the Education Reform Act 1988, that will establish higher education corporations to conduct those institutions. The corporations would be established in the autumn to prepare to assume responsibility for their institutions on 1 April 1991. My right hon. Friend already has power to fund higher education institutions under section 100 of the Education Act 1944—that is the power used to fund Trinity
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
college, Carmarthen—and would use that power to fund the new corporations from April 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I close with a word of thanks to those wno have served on the Wales advisory body and its standing working group. I have chaired that advisory body for the last six years, and we can be proud of what has been accomplished in that time. I am especially encouraged by the decision of the advisory body at the meeting in March that it should remain in being for one final year to advise on the funding allocations for 1992–93. I am sure that that is a clear signal that the local authorities, the colleges and the Welsh Office can continue to work together in the new situation to build on what has already been achieved in non -university higher education in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like many hon. Members, I welcome the order—but with mixed feelings. We should pay tribute to the old Glamorgan county council and Mid Glamorgan county council for doing so much for the polytechnic, which is in my constituency. It expanded from the old Treforest school of mining—which produced many fine engineers who have taken their Welsh skills all over the world —to become the huge establishment that it is today. As the Minister said, it is the second largest college in Wales; only University college, Cardiff is larger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I welcome the move; but my stance may be at variance with others in my party. I welcome it because there has been a big discrepancy between funding per student at English polytechnics compared with Welsh polytechnics and the polytechnic of Wales. Recognition of the central role that it plays in Welsh education and Welsh economic life is long overdue. The move will help to consolidate links that have already been constructed between newer industries and the polytechnic. It will not only help with funding future courses in the polytechnic, but it will make them more responsive to the needs of the economy and of the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that there is no little concern about compensation of local education authorities for investment in buildings, the fabric of the colleges and administrative costs. The Minister should say something about that. It is a moot point in many ways. Any investment in Welsh higher education contributes to the greater good, and we have all benefited from such investment. However, the issue of accounting for that investment in a social and political sense is important. I should be pleased to have some clarification from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also speak in more detail about funding? I hope that the transformation of the polytechnic into a new independent creature will not permit the colleges to remain as far behind their English equivalents as they have been—especially in crucial, high-capital-intensive areas of investment such as engineering and computer science. On many occasions, administrators of the polytechnic tell me about their financial worries; they do not have enough money to purchase the equipment necessary for them to be at the frontier of the link between academia and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the subject of my brief intervention. What is to be the relationship—formal and informal—between the various colleges and institutions listed by the Minister that are to attain independence? Will there be a federated relationship or will the institutions continue to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
independent bodies going their own way? Will there be a strategic approach to non-university higher education? Will there be any relationship between the listed colleges and the burgeoning tertiary colleges in certain parts of Wales, such as Neath? What relationship will be nurtured between those bodies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be arguments about how the colleges will emerge from the change, which I am glad to welcome as it is long overdue. I hope that the colleges will no longer be regarded as second-class institutions of education. That view is an awful legacy, as there has been much snobbery about the relationship between universities, polytechnics and other institutions. I hope that the higher education sector in Wales will be seen as a great fount of resource for young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing that the longer one stays in this place, the more one realises the need to watch for little innocuous, two-paragraph orders. In this short, simple order, which has scarcely a dozen words—most of which are unintelligible to people outside the House—the Minister is seeking a quite sweeping power to make major changes in higher education. Whether we are for or against those changes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) said, we are entitled to explore the implications of the power that is sought. That is the function of the House and of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order, which appears to be innocuous, does not refer to any colleges. We would not know that it related to Bangor normal college, the Welsh college of music and drama, the Cardiff and West Glamorgan institutes of higher education or the polytechnic. It therefore behoves us to investigate the power that is sought. I expect the Minister to say more about how he will exercise that power. As my hon. Friend said on a number of occasions, the Minister should explain the thinking of the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is a convoluted way of going about matters. The Minister referred to its legislative history, and I was astonished when I traced through the legislative references to the parent Act. Section 227(2) of the Education Reform Act 1988 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"section … 122 … of this Act shall not apply in relation to institutions in Wales".</p></blockquote>
However, in section 227(4), the right to exercise that power is clawed back. I do not understand that. That convoluted legislative system is incorporated in this small but important order. Whatever we think of that, it is how we must deal with the matter. However, we are entitled to translate that legislative gobbledegook into a meaningful and practical application of ministerial power. The Minister should say more about what he intends to do with the proposed power before the order is approved by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd discussed the financial implications of the order. There is an important financial relationship between the Mid Glamoran county council and the Welsh Office in the transfer of the polytechnic from county hands to the Welsh Office. Between 1985 and the current financial year, 1991–92, the Mid Glamorgan county council was not ungenerous to the polytechnic. Its capital expenditure from 1985 to April 1992 will total£11 million. The PRNI has
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
contributed£6·5 million of that figure, which was top sliced from Welsh Office funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Mid Glamorgan county council cannot claim that the polytechnic's funds came exclusively from its budget, £4·5 million is still unacccounted for. That amount was properly contributed by Mid Glamorgan county council from its approved capital expenditure towards the development of the polytechnic. By way of thanks for that contribution, the council will lose responsibility for the polytechnic to the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That£4.5 million is equivalent to four new primary schools. We can build a new primary school for£1 million. The Minister knows that there are more Edwardian primary schools in mid-Glamorgan than in almost any other part of the country. If the county had not invested its capital in the polytechnic, it would have been able to approve capital expenditure for four new primary schools. I shall not support the order unless the Minister reassures me that the Government will reimburse Mid Glamorgan county council by allowing it£4·5 million of capital approvals in place of what it spent from its fund towards the polytechnic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wishes to nationalise the polytechnic, which is what he seems to be doing, the£4·5 million of capital approvals must be given back to the county council so that it may continue to invest capital for education, for which it is responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman making a false point? I accept that considerable investment, both current and by way of capital, has been made in those institutions by the local education authorities that have responsibility for them. I accept also that the Welsh Office has invested in them through the PRNI and other forms of support. We have all contributed towards the strength of the colleges. However, the essential fact is that the colleges remain to serve local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but if Mid Glamorgan county council had known that the Secretary of State intended to nationalise the college, it might have decided differently about its £4·5 million allocation of capital expenditure, on the basis that it would have longer—term responsibility for what remained within its powers—in this case the primary education sector. There would have been an interesting democratic debate in the council about the balance of capital expenditure under the ceiling for capital approvals imposed on county councils by the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not asking for a beggar-my-neighbour policy. The county was willing to invest£4.5 million of its approvals. We are not arguing about the£6·5 million that was top sliced from the national programme. However, the£4·5 million of the county's capital approvals was put into the polytechnic on the assumption that it would remain responsible for the college, but that has now been changed by a sweep of the pen and a statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister merely to offer an olive branch, as part of the process of reconciliation and change that we are being asked to support, by responding to the county's request that the£4·5 million capital approval be given back to it so that it may continue the job of investing important capital expenditure in the primary education sector for which it remains responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the colleges away from localities. The order will give my right hon. Friend the right to incorporate the colleges, which will mean their being put under the governance of a different body, on which local authorities would be represented. We have also decided to fund the colleges directly under section 100 of the 1944 Act. There is no question of nationalisation, privatisation or any such thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not use the word "privatisation". It would be an act not of privatisation, but of nationalisation, whatever the Minister says. At the moment, the funding falls on the budget of the county council, which has properly fulfilled its duties. That financial responsibility is to be moved from the county council to the Welsh Office, and the governing body is being replaced by an independent body. The Minister made the point that the college should be free-standing and independent, financed directly by the Welsh Office and not from the county council budget. The county contributed£4.5 million, out of its£11 million capital expenditure, to that process—the financial equivalent of four primary schools. As an act of reconciliation, I hope that the Minister will re-allocate the capital approvals back to the county, so that it can get on with the job of developing its schools sector, and especially its primary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in 1991–92, the county council is carrying the burden of interest charges on its approvals. Before we approve the order, will the Minister please tell us who will carry that burden in future? From April 1992, those interest charges will presumably fall on the Welsh Office. In view of the Minister's decision to shift responsibility for the college from the county to the Welsh Office, will he tell us what the county will be expected to pay during this financial year? Is it expected to carry the interest charges on capital expenditure for a college for which it will have no responsibility? It is reasonable to ask that that be clarified before we give approval to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county will contribute£500,000 to the funding of the polytechnic this year. I do not make my observations in a beggar-my-neighbour spirit; it would be valuable to know what we are talking about—and we are talking about the cost that is being borne by poll tax payers, willingly in many cases, for an institution for which the county will not be responsible if we give the Minister this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to ask the Minister about the other colleges, and in particular about their future financing. Once the Minister is given this power, it will pave the way for him to incorporate the colleges. He said that another order will be introduced in the autumn, and we shall pick over its details in a subsequent debate. The Minister is seeking that power now, to pave the way for changes, and we should be given a better insight into those changes. He told us that the polytechnic will have local government representation. What about the other colleges? What will be the make-up of the governing bodies? Will the Minister share his thoughts on the nature of the governing body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) mentioned the important relationship between polytechnics and universities, which is being much talked about nationally. There is a notion that polytechnics might end up in the university sector. I do not know the latest ministerial thinking on that. Does the order mean that that would not happen in Wales? Is it a definitive statement of policy from the Minister on the relationship between the polytechnic in Wales and the universities? Personally, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
have mixed feelings on the subject. As someone who began his academic life in what was then called the college of advanced technology in Cardiff, and who watched it join the university sector and thrive, and then merge with it, I am worried that specialist development education may be disappearing. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) referred to the Treforest school of mining. We are moving away from the distinctive contribution that such institutions have made and from the opportunities that they have offered, and which have differred from the old fashioned academic way. Gradually, they have all begun to look alike. I was worried about that when the college of advanced technology was incorporated into the university sector, although my worries have not been born out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister seeks approval for the order, he should share his thoughts with us about how he envisages the relationship between the new free-standing polytechnic and the university of Wales. What further action would need to be taken if it were decided in the near future that the polytechnic should become a part of the university sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we give power to the Minister through this innocuous order, there are profound, interesting and important decisions to be made about the shape and pattern of higher education in the Principality. What was totally missing from the—[
	<i>Interuption.</i>] I know that the right hon. Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark) is impatient and I am sorry that he has been saddled with coming to the Committee, but it is of profound concern to Welsh people, if no one else, that these matters are fully explored and developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not once mention money. In April 1992, the Welsh Office will be financially responsible for Bangor normal, Cardiff and West Glamorgan institutes of higher education, Gwent college and the Welsh college of music and drama. My hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell), who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs will be interested in the figures. Perhaps he or the Minister can correct me, but I do not think that the Welsh Office's current and capital expenditure programmes for the colleges for which it is to assume financial responsibility are included in the 1992–93 public expenditure figures. We know what the county councils contributed to the polytechnics and what local authorities contributed to the various other colleges through capital and revenue costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the current estimate of what the Welsh Office will offer us in 1992–93 to finance that group of colleges? My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd referred to the character of the polytechnic at Treforest and a reasonably generous effort was made by a county strapped for cash, and with enormous and competing demands on its resources because of a backlog of deprivation, especially in its physical, educational and capital programmes. How niggly, expansive or generous will the Welsh Office be now that those colleges are to be—I refuse to withdraw the word—nationalised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
As my colleagues have suggested, the implications of the order are far reaching. What concerns me is that in introducing the order, the Welsh Office is yet again showing that it is somewhere at the back of the queue in the programme for institutional change in education. In other words, it is following, three to four years later, what has taken place in other institutions in the United Kingdom. Scotland has had central institutions for many years. As the Minister said, England has central institutions funded by the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council. In Wales, we are making a decision to take effect next year and beyond about the structure of the existing institutions of higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister and other hon. Members not to refer to those colleges as the non-university sector. I may be wearing my university of Wales tie today— a tie which is beloved by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Prince of Wales—but, as a graduate and post graduate of that university, I should certainly not refer to our partners in the higher education sector in Wales as the non-university sector. Those colleges have made a specific contribution and have a particular academic structure and expertise in their own right as colleges of higher education. We should stop describing them as non-something. It is like those people in Wales who describe the majority of the population as non-Welsh speakers, as if that were somehow a negative category and a negative definition. I shall not stray out of order by discussing those issues, although they are relevant to Welsh medium teaching and some of the communications studies work in those institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The colleges are higher education partners with the other institutions in Wales. They are now to be independent partners, based in their localities and funded directly by the Welsh Office. I support that decision. I express, too, my support for and recognition of the work of the Wales advisory body and the work that the Minister has undertaken as the Minister responsible for higher education in Wales, and responsible for chairing WAB and for the allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that, in allowing that sector to become independent, he was referring back to the Education Reform Act 1988. At that time, the Government decided to leave open the options for the future. To what extent are the options still open for those institutions? They are being given independence late when compared with what happened in England and Scotland. Northern Ireland provides a different model; for some years the polytechnic sector there has been part of the university and is funded in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need an assurance from the Minister that, if we approve this order, we are not closing the options for future relationships between the various sectors of higher education in Wales and, indeed, between what happens in Wales and outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken on this issue several times, both inside and outside the House, and hope to continue so to do. I shall not repeat what was said in the Welsh Grand Committee on 5 December 1990 on the general argument, but merely commment on what is relevant to this order. I want to ask the Minister about the new body. He spoke of this issue today and it was also mentioned in a written answer in 
	<i>Hansard</i> on 30 January 1991, in c. 514–5, when the Secretary of State announced the decision. What will be the relationship between the body that he is setting up—a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
successor to WAB; a group of people involved in higher education and business to advise on higher education funding—and the existing University Funding Council sub-committee for Wales? For example, teacher training education is a cross-binary activity funded both sides of the line. In that case, it is clear that there must be co-operation in the allocation of places to institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister envisage further co-operation between the WAB successor and the UFC sub-committee for Wales, and also between that body and the internal system now operating in the university under the federal system for the planning and funding of courses? That is important in view of the discussions referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney about what may be happening in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the PCFC and the UFC will be joint tenants of a building in Bristol. We also read in the educational press and elsewhere that the Government are about to publish a White Paper dealing with higher education, in which the issue of the binary line and the future relationship between the PCFC and the UFC will be raised. What worries me is that yet again, as with the Education Reform Act 1988, Wales will be at the back of the queue in this further change. I know that there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State is responsible for all our education in Wales, except the university. If he were a Minister in Northern Ireland, he would also be the Minister with responsibility for the university. If he were a Minister in Scotland, he would experience yet another structure, as the UFC in Scotland directly funds individual universities. Wales has a federal unversity that is funded by the UFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister lift the lid on my next point? I am sure that the thinking behind the order started in the Welsh Office, because I cannot imagine it taking place on the binary line in the Department of Education and Science without parallel thinking in the Welsh Office. Are we to have a binary line along the river Severn, administered from the other side in Bristol? Clearly, the Minister will not hand back these colleges to the PCFC if the PCFC and the UFC are converging in Bristol. Neither is it conceivable that the Scottish institutions will be handed back. Therefore, we are left with a serious issue. How will the Welsh Office relate its function for these institutions with what is likely to happen—if what is reported about the White Paper is correct—when the UFC and the PCFC converge and we have only one higher education structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am slightly worried about the tone and temper of his argument. He seems to imply that we should more quickly follow the English model. Surely there is a good case for standing back to decide whether we want to do something different, even if the Government publish their White Paper on the relationship between university and polytechnic funding. The hon. Gentleman seems to be a surprisingly British conformist on this argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to get into a nationalist argument with the hon. Gentleman. That would be completly out of order. I want the best institutional relationship possible for post-16 education in Wales. I am not necessarily following the English model indeed, I am following the Northern Ireland model. I was about to suggest that we need a federal structure under which the institutions are related to the federal university, which itself
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
could then be related to the merged PCFC and UFC. That model would be acceptable for the numbers that we have in our institutions in the university of Wales and, to a lesser extent, in the higher education sector. It would lead us to achieve a powerful, well organised, higher education system that would relate, as the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) mentioned, to the new further education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One institution not in the order, and which undertakes higher education work, is the north east institute of Wales for higher education. It is not included because it does not have more than 55 per cent. higher education full-time equivalents and cannot be included in that category. It is important to mention that the higher education activity has continued, and that must be related to planning for higher education as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to lift the lid on this discussion, otherwise institutional changes in Wales will follow-on late and we will have lost the opportunity to set up a more integrated higher education system with better access. Our colleagues in England, and those in Scotland in a different way, will move ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That wonderful character, the ex-chief executive of the UFC, in a series of retirement speeches referred to an independent structure for universities in Scotland, and said that it would be foolish to set up such a structure in Wales. I can see the value of his argument, but we need to have a structure for Wales that links between higher education and with the clients of that system who choose to become students in Wales at the university and at other institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not want to cover all of my points in his reply today. I wanted to make sure that those points were on the record and that the Department would consider them, otherwise we may well miss an opportunity to reorganise our higher education structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about funding. The Minister must tell us a lot more about funding patterns. We know about the historic underfunding of the institutions. We also know that the unit costs of higher education in Wales, contained in the Welsh Office's Government expenditure plan document, are inadequate to meet the needs of students, staffing, maintenance of institutions and so on. It is no good the Welsh Office allowing institutions to be independent and then taking over their funding, if it will not give actual figures for that funding. Clearly, the planning exercise is taking place within WAB. I know the people who have run WAB over the years, and I am sure that they have started, if not completed, the planning. The information exists in the Welsh Office. It probably came with me on the 125 train this morning, but whether it will come out of the box when the Minister speaks is another matter. It would be helpful to have those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to transbinary co-operation in Wales, and the Welsh Office should take that seriously. It may not want ministerial responsibility for the university of Wales—that is a burden that very few people want—but the responsibility for working between those two sectors must be sorted out. It is for the Welsh Office to sort that out with the Department of Education and Science before the White Paper is published, and not three years later with a further order suggesting a discussion between the federal university and the higher education institutions in Wales on how to create a more integrated system of post-16 and post-18 education. That would be too late; we would have missed another three years and the opportunity to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
innovative in Welsh education. That is what the order before us should facilitate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take too much of the Committee's time, but I wish to add to some of the points made by my hon Friends. My hon Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) was correct when he said that the smallness of the order before us is not relevant to its significance to Wales, because all higher education will be affected by it. The number of questions that the Minister has been asked this morning—I shall be asking a few more—shows how significant the order is. The Minister knows that the education press has not been kind to the suggestions before us. A leader in
	<i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>a few weeks ago referred to the proposed solution as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the worst of both worlds, condemned to an apparently inferior status without any hope of developing a distinctive national role."</p></blockquote>
I do not agree with everything stated in the article, but it should be noted that it referred to the inadequacy of the Welsh Office to cope with the changes. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was correct when he referred to nationalisation because the Welsh Office is bound to have a new role in higher education in Wales.
	<i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Welsh Office has neither the administrative experience nor the educational vision to offer creative leadership. Vague talk of the need for a committee to advise the Secretary of State on higher education matters is confirmation of his office's inadequacy. Any comparison with the situation in Scotland is wide of the mark. The century-old Scottish Education Department is a robust bureaucracy—too robust for the taste of many Scots educators … The Welsh Office is not in the same league."</p></blockquote>
That must be borne in mind when considering that further and tertiary education will become the responsibility of the Welsh Office instead of local government. Does the Minister believe that the Welsh Office, without considerable expansion in its expertise and staff, can cope with that major administrative headache?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of my hon. Friends referred to local government. What will happen to the money that has been invested, not only by Mid Glamorgan county council, which has spent the lion's share, but by all the county councils involved—Gwent, West Glamorgan, South Glamorgan and Gwynedd—all of which have put major sums of current and capital expenditure into their budgets for colleges of higher education. It is important to remember the amount of Welsh Office funding that Mid Glamorgan has received for the polytechnic since 1982–83. Before then, Mid Glamorgan county council spent considerable sums of its own money. I believe that prior to 1980–81 the figure was almost£500,000, and in 1981–82 it was£250,000. All Welsh local education authorities spent a great deal of money. The issue of funding must be at the top of the agenda when the Minister replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) made an important point about opportunities. We have missed an opportunity to have a distinctive Welsh solution to the whole question of higher education, whether in universities or polytechnics. Many imaginative and interesting ideas were put to the Minister during consultations. One of those was whether Welsh polytechnics should have a federal structure to match the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
university federal structure. I am aware of the administrative problems, but if that had happened the colleges of higher education would have enjoyed much greater prestige, status and enhancement then they will under the new regime. I cite Gwent as an example, as its college of higher education is a fine institution. The county of Gwent, which has 500,000 people, has no university or polytechnic. If the office had been given a federal structure on the lines of the polytechnic of Wales, the status of the Gwent college would have been enhanced considerably. That opportunity has been missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will answer those serious questions, which come not only from politicians but from educationists, local government and, above all, those who use the Principality's education services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members who participated in the debate, which has covered more ground than the scope of the order. I do not complain about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there are what are known as transbinary problems—those of co-operation between higher education institutions in Wales and the university colleges. They have the common characteristic that they provide degree courses and award degrees. This issue has preoccupied the Wales advisory body for as long as I can remember. I recall that, partly as a result of our preoccupation with those issues, a sub-committee of the Universities Funding Council was established for Wales with cross-membership from the Wales advisory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) would have me disclose the contents of the forthcoming White Paper, where these issues will be further discussed, together with possible solutions. I assure him, the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and others that we shall have the interests of Wales very much in mind when we formulate the content and composition of the White Paper. I assure the hon. Gentleman that Wales has not been forgotten; it is far from an afterthought. The interests of Wales and Welsh higher education are at the forefront of our minds as we approach the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has focused on the question of resources, and I must make my position clear. I shall continue my argument with the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). It is nonsense to suggest that local authorities, to which I pay tribute for their provision of higher education and their support for educational institutions, should be compensated for what they have done. They were acting under statute and were providing for the interests of their localities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed changes through incorporation do not involve a change of function for institutions of higher education, which will continue to provide the services that they have provided in the past. The whole thrust of incorporation is to enable them to perform services better than before. I remind Opposition Members of their own document on the future of local government in Wales. At the end of paragraph 21 of the chapter entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"The future of local government in Wales"</p></blockquote>
they recommend that
	<br><blockquote><p>"regional government should take on the responsibility for public sector higher education."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Of course, I accept that we are incorporating and funding these institutions directly from the Welsh Office rather than from the regions, as suggested by Opposition Members, but I see no basic difference of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney also mentioned interest charges. The assets of colleges will be transferred from local authorities to new bodies from 1 April 1992. Meanwhile, they remain in the ownership of local education authorities. The transfer will be dealt with as provided for by the Education Reform Act 1988 through the Education Assets Board. A clear procedure has been laid down for the transfer of assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained that we require no special powers other than those contained within the Education Act 1944 to fund any higher education colleges. We already fund Trinity college, Carmarthen from the Welsh Office. Resources will be transferred from local to central government to form the basis of Welsh Office funding. The Secretary of State will decide, after consultation in the summer with the Welsh consultation committee for local government finance, on the amount to be transferred. A preliminary consultation with local education authorities at official level is being undertaken now to establish the expenditure of LEAs on higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, funding is provided through the local government route by the Welsh Office, by means of revenue support grant to higher education colleges. In future, after the negotiations that I have described have taken place, money will be given directly to those colleges rather than through local authorities. On incorporation, the colleges will become legal entities. At present, they have no legal right to hold property and so on other than through their local education authorities. Incorporation will give them a legal status of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have asked questions about different scales of funding for colleges in England, Scotland and Wales. We are not comparing like with like, as different funding arrangements in the three countries make it difficult to compare true figures. For example, Welsh figures exclude the significant topping-up payments paid by local education authorities, and the PCFC figures exclude some of the cheaper local authority higher education provision in England. After transfer on 1 April 1992, funding of the institutions will be determined by the Secretary of State during the annual public expenditure round, and it will be easier thereafter to compare Welsh arrangements with English and Scottish arrangements. I repeat that they are not directly comparable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that we appreciate the contributions that have been made by local authorities, but we must not forget the contributions of taxpayers generally. The colleges serve local communities, and will do so after incorporation. Their change of status from maintained colleges to independent self-governing institutions, and the change of funding responsibility to the Welsh Office, will not change their ability to contribute to the well-being and advancement of young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say a little more about funding from April 1992? He has said more than once that there is to be enhanced education provision as a result of the creation of independent colleges and Welsh Office funding.

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
colleges? Can he give an estimate of the Welsh Office budget for capital expenditure for the new colleges from that date? He must have some idea by now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be frank with the hon. Gentleman. He knows that we have not decided the details of expenditure for 1992–93. I do not think that funding through the PRNI system of capital projects at the polytechnic and at other colleges such as Gwent is ideal. I should like it to be changed. When we consider the other projects of regional or national importance that are funded through PRNI, it is clear that these colleges should have a special place in capital development and funding. I have already said that negotiations are proceeding with the local education authorities that are worried about revenue-funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the many years that I have been a member of WAB, we have annually increased the quantum of funding that is available to higher education colleges. With an advisory committee of experts and representatives from industry and so on advising the Secretary of State—to an extent in the way that the Wales advisory body and its working group did—and with incorporation, we shall be able to put the colleges on a better footing. We shall also be able to give them the independence and freedom that they need to develop. We shall ensure that they are properly advised and fully informed so that there is, for example, no unnecessary duplication of courses. We have begun to do that extensively, through WAB, although we shall not give colleges a formal, federal structure or anything like that. I am sure that there will be collaboration to apply those measures to university colleges, which must have a relationship with local education authorities and the further education sector. There must be cohesion if the education system is to prosper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I bring the Minister back to a point that was raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas)?

How will that affect their independent decision-making powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking a hypothetical question. Funding for a polytechnic, as an incorporated body, will come from the Welsh Office. The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot anticipate the contents of the White Paper, as hon. Members would have me do. However, I assure them that I am grateful for the points that they have made this morning, which were not new to me. Their points are under consideration. The relationship in the higher education or non-university sector and—or however we choose to describe it—university sector is in our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred several times to the role played by local authorities in higher education in Wales. When he discussed the duties of local authorities in setting up and funding colleges, he said, I think, that local authorities acted under statute. However, they did not act under mandatory statute. The local authorities took up options to improve higher education in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
If local authorities no longer have a major role in higher education in colleges, what will happen to new colleges? Who will be responsible for setting up new polytechnics, colleges, a federal structure, or whatever? Presumably, it will be the Welsh Office, but as I said earlier we are doubtful whether it could deal with that. The Minister rightly said that a Welsh assembly would be an appropriate body to deal with the problem. Initiative is important. Once the colleges are incorporated it will be difficult for them to establish others.

The Minister also referred to funding—or the quantum, as he called it. He should remember that HMI reports have stated clearly that the quantum is not enough to cover higher education expenditure in Wales, especially as the student population is artificially limited by the WAB planning exercise. LEAs have not pressed for an increase to the quantum only because it would be taken out of their block grant. It should be additional to, rather than part of, the block grant. Higher education has been inadequately funded.

My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) asked the legitimate question about what guarantee we have, given the inadequacy of public funding of higher education, that the new regime will improve matters. The Minister was unprepared to say precisely what is to be proposed in the White Paper. He should go further and tell us that there will be a section in it that refers specifically to the problems of Welsh higher education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can go so far as to say that we shall deal with Welsh higher education in the White Paper. I wish to return to the hon. Gentleman's quotation from the leader in
	<i>The Times Higher Educational Supplement.</i> It does not reflect the views of those who are prominent in the Welsh higher education sector. I have every confidence in the capacity of the Welsh Office to perform its funding function. I have six years' experience of WAB behind me. I have gained knowledge as a result, and I know that the Welsh Office is well able to deal with funding and advise on Welsh higher education. It will not surprise hon. Members to know that the Welsh Office will take over the WAB secretariat, which has done the work in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot go any further in providing information about the quantum. The hon. Member for Torfaen will understand that I cannot anticipate Government spending in a year or more from now. All I can say is that over the years we have succeeded in increasing the quantum available, and have taken corrective action to raise the level of per capita expenditure in that sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sense that the Committee understands that higher education colleges have outgrown their local authority parentage and are now mature enough to be given the freedom that incorporation confers. We want the colleges to have freedom and independence so that they can better serve the young people from England and Wales who attend as students. The future is ever more challenging. Colleges are facing competition not only from higher education authorities across the border in England, but from universities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
