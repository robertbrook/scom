	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>National Health Service and Community Care Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Since the Committee passed the original motion, matters have arisien that affect the order of consideration. It is hoped that the Committee will reach clause 3 later today, or certainly by Thurdsay, and clauses 3 and 4 represent the most important aspects of the Bill in that they set up the new concept of the provider market in health care. Hon. Members will want to raise specific questions on that concept. Clearly, the Department of Health's position will be critical to the consideration of the working of contracts. The Department issued a letter to the chairmen and general managers of regional and district health authorities in September which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The objective of increasing the efficiency of the NHS will only be realised if competition delivers more in the value of savings and/or quality improvements… unfortunately the conditions for an efficient market for long and short term contracts will be lacking in the NHS."</p></blockquote>
The document dealt especially with the threat of the abuse of monopolies. It is crucial to the discussion of contracts to know the Department's views. Only yesterday, it came to my attention that the Department is working on a document, that will deal specifically with the problem outlined in its letter. It is to be published in the next few weeks. The document is central to the discussion of contracts that we shall have on clauses 3 and 4. As those clauses effectively stand on their own would it not make more sense to discuss other equally contentious aspects of the Bill first? It would not cause a loss of knowledge. Indeed our debate would be informed about the costing and potential monopoly abuses of Health Service contracts if the Department published the document within the next two or three weeks. Would it be in order for the consideration of clauses 3 and 4 to be delayed until the Department of Health's document is published, so that we may have a more informed and relevant debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not lie within the power of the Chairman to alter the order of consideration; that is a matter for the entire Committee. I could accept a motion to change that order only from the Minister in charge of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Dame Janet. The document that the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) refers to will be published shortly, but it will not contain a new statement of principles or policy. It will be about the application of existing principles. There are already working papers and consultative documents that deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
with the operation of contracts. When the Committee discusses clause 3 it will be aware of the arguments about the principle of contracts, but not the last detail of their operational implementation. I do not therefore believe that the hon. Gentleman has advanced valid arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. In Committe last Thursday, the Under-Secretary of State for Health promised to draw the attention of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales to some anxieties about Wales that were raised in the debate. When shall we have his observations on those issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order, but no doubt the Minister concerned will have heard the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a separate point of order, Dame Janet. You have previously ruled that the Committee's membership is entirely a matter for the Committee of Selection. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales was appointed to the Committee because Welsh issues needed to be dealt with by a Minister with his responsibilities. Last week the Under-Secretary was absent for the launch of a body that was entirely his and his hon. Friends' creation. I am sure that if it had been asked to change the date of the launch it would have replied, "Yes, Minister." Will the Under-Secretary attend the Committee in future to answer questions from Labour Ministers who want to debate the effect of the Bill on Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chairman. The attendance of Ministers of the Committee is a matter for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. The Minister pointed out that no new principle was involved in clauses 3 and 4, and that technical details would be fleshed out later. I thought that the Committee's purpose was to examine the detail of legislation, which means looking at the Bill's technical and practical implications for the Health Service. That is why I said in my original point of order that it would be better to postpone our discussion until such details were available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot pursue that now because, as I have explained, the order can be altered only in the manner that I described. The point has been made and will, no doubt, be recognised by those who are listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. Can my name be added to the list of those who attend the Committee's last sitting? I voted and spoke but I was omitted from the attendance list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that 
	<i>Hansard</i> will have noted the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>REGIONAL AND DISTRICT HEALTH AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss clause 1. It represents a remarkable system for potential jobbery and fixing; the Minister would appoint people who would then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
appoint managers, and together they would appoint everyone else. Labour Ministers have already drawn attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet discussed the linked ability, in lines 16 and 17, to abolish or change the boundaries of health authorities by decree. It is typical of the Government not only to seek to create the potential for jobbery and fixing, but to create an atmosphere of abolition and administrative reorganisation, so that they might coerce people into obedience. We are deeply disturbed by that, and its consequences can already be seen in the NHS. There is an enormous wastage of the general managers who were appointed under the general management scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In lines 16 and 17 of clause 1, the Government propose to abolish district health authorities by decree or to vary their boundaries without consultation. That would be a further attack on the integrity and performance of NHS management. It would also have serious implications for involvement and consultation with communities, and for the boundaries of district health authorities, which should reflect community identity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lines 16 and 17 of clause 1 are not trivial: they lie at the heart of the Bill. They would give the Government disturbing additional power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is not amended, district health authorities will lose many of their functions. They will manage far less. There is already a loss of morale among some sections of district health authority management, for which there is only one traditional corrective; additional money. We will await with interest the Government's announcement on pay rises for NHS management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lines 16 and 17 also raise the issue of what will happen to community health councils if the district health council is abolished. There has already been one example of an amalgamation of two district health authorities in London which led to the amalgamation of their associated community health councils. I refer to the formation in West London of Parkside health authority, which covers an area of considerable diversity and stress. It was unfortunate and a great administrative error that when the health authorities were amalgamated the community health councils were too. We seek an assurance that if the Governement take the power to abolish district health authorities, the position of their associated community health councils will be respected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lines 16 and 17 are also significant because of the proposal for self-governing trusts for opted-out hospitals. There is no shadow of doubt that that will further reduce the responsibilities of district health authorities. The Government made that point in paragraph 3.20 of the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The establishment of NHS Hospital Trusts will mean a substantial change in the responsibilities of DHA's which were responsible for their management. As more and more proposals for establishing NHS Hospitals Trusts come forward. RHAs will need to consider the viability of existing DHAs and the possibility of sensible merger with neighbouring Districts."</p></blockquote>
But lines 16 and 17 do not refer to regional health authorities having a cushioning or buffer role in that respect. They merely give Ministers the power for immediate abolition of health authorities or a
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
variation of their boundaries. That is inconsistent with the White Paper. The Minster needs to spell out clearly this morning—it is not mentioned in the Bill—what evaluation regional health authorities will be asked to undertake before they decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my health district in Newcastle, three of the four hospitals have expressed an interest in forming self-governing trusts. What is the role of district health authority in that context? That question is being asked by members of the district health authority and their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the neighbouring district health authority, there is a proposal for whole district opt-out, an extraordinary proposal under which, for a time, the general manager rides two horses. He is both the candidate manager of a whole-district opted-out NHS trust and the actual manager of the district health authority from which he is to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Darlington, a small health district, there is a situation that is common throughout the country. A single district general hospital proposes to opt out and become a self-governing trust. What will be left of the pattern of services in that district health authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the likely consequences. North Tyneside health authority minutes show that secret discussions are taking place between Newcastle and North Tyneside health authorities about amalgamating because of the changes. People—especially health authority managers —are entitled to expect a process of consultation, not the abolition by decree of, health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal will not strengthen NHS management; it will undermine it. It will centralise, not decentralise, the key power to abolish health authorities by putting it in the hands of Ministers. It will put at even greater risk the connection between district health authorities and the people who look to them to provide services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Livingston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of whether the Committee should divide on clause 1 provides an opportunity for us to reflect on how the clause has been improved and amended after consideration, debate, and lobbying by outside organisations which are taking a close interest in our proceedings. It is easy to sum up the extent of that amendment and improvement: the Government have not accepted or tolerated one amendment. I presume that it is such intransigence that has earned for the Secretary of State the endorsement of the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), who supports his candidature for the succession to the Conservative party leadership, and who described him as an aggressive and combative chappie. Committee members have witnessed that combative aggression in the Secretary of State's refusal to countenance even the most modest and well argued amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Couchman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gillingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Secretary concede that the amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Sims), which sought to probe the Government's intentions about doctors serving on the new health authorities in an executive or non-executive role, was clarified by my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
who, in effect, accepted the amendment? Furthermore, did not my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary make the matter of community health councils crystal clear and go a long way towards the amendments which dealt with them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Dame Janet, that you can guide the hon. Gentelman on the distinction between clarifying and carrying an amendment. I did not say that an amendment had not been clarified. The hon. Gentleman claims that two aspects of the Bill have been clarified; but they were clarified without commitment, and I shall give way happily to the Under-Secretary if he wishes to give a commitment to bring forward amendments on either of those points on Report. Without such a commitment, the clause will not be amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Jerry Hayes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about community health councils can be found in the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of the Committee's last sitting. If the hon. Gentleman was not present, I shall tell him that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham asked me for an assurance, which I will give him. We do not propose to change the basis of CHCs. their duties and relationship to health authorities because they must be independent. They will continue to have observers at health authority meetings and I pay tribute to their work. As a Minister. I probably see more representatives from CHCs than do other Ministers, and I appreciate their dedicated and valuable work." — 
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 11 January 1990: c. 140.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary could not have gone further than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was asked in an Opposition amendment to accept the right of community health councils to representation on the new district health authorities, and the Committee was told firmly that that would not be possible. Community health councils have the right to observe health authority meetings, as do other members of the public. The great irony of the clause —I shall return to the subject later in my speech—results from the provision for the first time for paid membership of the health authorities: the Bill for the salaries of health authority members will exceed the total resources provided by the Government to support the entire staff, expenditure and research work of community health councils. That is an eloquent statement of the relative priorities which they attach to CHCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition tabled a series of amendments to probe the nature of the new health authorities for which the clause paves the way. The amendments have universally been knocked back. In the previous sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) urged the case for special representation of ethnic minorities; that was knocked back. My hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) pressed for representation of disabled people, who are among the groups that will be most affected by what we debate here and by the future shape of health authorities. Incidentally, one remark that most struck me as betraying an incomprehension of what we are doing was the observation of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) that patients are people who go into hospital for two weeks and then come out again. That luxury is not available to disabled people. As they
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
have a permanent interest in the Health Service, not merely a two-week interval in hospital, surely they are entitled to consideration in the structure of the new health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) pressed the case for representation of women. There is no provision for a balance between the sexes or for particular representation of women on health authorities, despite women's clear interest in the future of the Health Service. I speak on this subject with some feeling today—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Tim Boswell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of our earlier exchanges and my specific response about women's representation, will the hon. Gentleman say what proportion of the Opposition Front Bench in Committee is represented by women? Is it 40 per cent. or, as it appears, rather lower than that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it is not enough. The hon. Gentleman asked a question to which he knows the answer and to that extent he delays and wastes the Committee's time—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It was patently such an attempt. I assure the hon. Gentleman however, that the matter is under serious investigation in the party and by a committee of which I am a member— 
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I am perfectly confident—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hinchclifte 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members think that it is funny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they think that the issue of women's representation is funny. Conservative Members think it amusing that Labour is considering how to improve women's representation in Parliament and on the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that within the next two to three years we shall have changed our rules so that there will be a provision for precisely the sort of percentage to which the hon. Gentleman referred. As someone who will have to compete on rather more difficult terms than at present, I welcome that. That is the right way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the frivolous intervention of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) I was saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham tabled an amendment about women's representation on health authorities. I speak on that subject with some feeling today. At the weekend, I learnt that the gynaecological ward in the district general hospital that serves my constituency will be closed with effect from a week on Thursday. The gynaecologist in charge of that ward has been offered, in place of his present 25 beds, six beds in the ear, nose and throat ward. Therefore, women who go into hospital for sterilisation, termination of pregnancy and investigation of infertility, for example will wake up after the anaesthetic in that ward. One can picture the conversation that will follow. The person in the next bed will say, "I am here to have my adenoids fixed, dear. What are you in here for?" But those patients are in hospital for investigation which they wish to be treated with discretion and some privacy. It is hard to imagine that a health authority with proper women's representation would make a decision of such crass insensitivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, we tabled an amendment to prevent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
health authorities from being influenced in their deliberation by those with a financial interest in the contracts awarded by the authorities. It was noted that Ministers who were unwilling to make positive provision for ethnic minorities, the disabled or women were willing to protect the representation of those with financial interest in those contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has not been without its insights. The hon. Member for Pembroke, who is no longer present, gave us one of the most interesting. He told us that patients are people who spend two weeks' receiving treatment within the Health Service. His other startling observation, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West, was that local authorities are bogus organisations. We shall hang that phrase round his neck on many future occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution that went to the heart of our debate came, as it so often does from this ministerial team, from the Under-Secretary of State for Health, whom I hope one day will inherit the role of Secretary of State. When we debated the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West on the right of local authorities to be consulted about membership of health authorities, the Under-Secretary rebutted that amendment, in terms that my hon. Friend will well recall, by saying that it was not right for local authorities to be consulted about appointments because persons who emerged from that process of consultation would then feel that they represented the local authorities which had been consulted. That observation went to the heart of the debate. Effectively, the Under-Secretary said that there is no room on the new health authorities for those representing specific interests, localities or elected authorities. Therefore we are not discussing bodies in which the Government see any role for a pluralist democracy representing different interests and local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the contrary, the Under-Secretary made it clear that the authorities will have to take corporate decisions; they will be extensions of a corporate state in which their sole function is to administer locally the central strategy that is determined by the Government in power who have a majority at Westminster. That leaves the health authorities without any concept of accountability to local people, knowledge of local circumstances, or of pride, affection and commitment to the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people on these health authorities will be appointed by the Secretary of State, or by people appointed by the Secretary of State, and here I borrow the Parliamentary Under-Secretary's terminology, to represent the Secretary of State. Other than that, we know nothing about them.

One of the striking features about the debate is the failure of the Committee—Opposition Members take their full share of responsibility for the failure—to gain any gleam about the type of person who the Government will appoint when the clause is agreed to and the Bill is enacted. One can only suspect, on the basis of present appointments, that whoever they are, they will have no local connections. For example, that was obvious from the startling choice made last year by the Secretary of State to appoint to the chair of the Bradford health authority the retired chief executive
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
of Westminister city council—not even an appoximate authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Secretary of State appointed Mrs. Diana Eccles to the chair of Ealing district health authority. Her immediate disqualification should have been that she lists her address as north Yorkshire. That prompted one of the most perfect press releases that I have seen from the local COHSE branch. It said that Mrs. Diana Eccles knew nothing of Ealing and even less about the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Couchman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Eccles lives very close to the House at Westminister, has considerable knowledge of Ealing and is an excellent chairman of its health authority, not to mention that she generally accords with the shadow spokesman's understudy, the hon.

With respect to Mrs. Diana Eccles, it is true that she claims a pied-a-terre in Westminster. However, her address is listed as Multon Hall, north Yorshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to the chairman of the Ealing district health authority, which covers the constituency that I represent. I suggest that before the hon. Gentleman says anything else about Diana Eccles he talks to members of his party in Ealing to obtain their assessmentt of her chairmanship. He will be told that she is one of the best and most effective chairmen that there has been in Ealing and that her party afiliation has nothing whatever to do with her commitment to her post.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made two points to which I must respond. First, I shall be happy to take up the hon. Gentleman's invitation to speak to members of my party, pursue the point with them and await their response with interest. A comment made by the hon. Gentleman was extremely revealing and I am sure that it was not lost on my hon. Friends. I said nothing whatever about Diana Eccles' party affiliations. I merely observed that she was someone who lists her home as being in north Yorkshire but turns up in Ealing. Suddenly the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) raised the subject of party affiliation. There is, I assumed a party affiliation, as Mrs. Diana Eccles is the daughter-in-law of a former Tory Education Minister, and there may be a tie-in with the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Minister for Health shaking her head. I was intrigued to learn this morning that her father is the chairman of West Lambeth district health authority. He has a distinguished career. I had not previously connected him with the hon. Lady, but I remember being inspired by his work for the Industrial Society when I organised industrial relations classes. I must say, however, that I find it difficult to perceive the family connection with West Lambeth, again we find people who may, in their own way, have a role to play in public service —I take Diana Eccles into this

	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
embrace—but who certainly have no cliams to speak for the locality whose public sector they administer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will bring about an extinction of tradition of people serving on their health authority because of pride in and affection for their local community, who were anxious therefore, to bring to it the best possible standard of public service in the Health Service. In its place, we shall have the commercial model of non-executive directors on a board of management, thanks to clause 1 and and the associated schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), I said that various non-executive directors will not undertake their role out of commitment to the community as present members do; they will do so because they will be paid, and paid reasonably generously by current public sector standards. The explanatory memorandum suggests a total expenditure of £10.5 million, which will mean annual honorariums in excess of £5,000 each. I find it strikingly ironic that the government should pave the way for payment to non-executive members of health authorities at the very time that they are acting to curb the right of local authority councillors to receive allowances even though they have been elected by their local community, as a result of the clause, out from the authorities will go at last remaining representatives of local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority representatives who have the advantage that a condition of their election is that they live in the community—the government have not yet suggested a ban on the residential qualification for election to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet, so Mrs. Diana Eccles and Mr. John Garnett can be elected to serve on authorities other than their own. Local authority representations have the advantage of being elected by their community and of being accountable to it. They also run, organise, administer and decide on the strategy for their local social services departments with which health authorities have to co-operate and with which they must co-operate increasingly as we face a growth in the number of elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those representatives, who perhaps have the strongest claim of all to on health authorities in the future, have been swept aside by the clause. I do not believe that the Committee should let them go quietly into the night. I advise my hon. Friends to divide the Committee on Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I asked the Minister—</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no! Here we go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
do well to listen. I asked the Minister at the end of my modest contribution whether he would
	<br><blockquote><p>"give assurances—not those set out on page 23 in the White Paper, which are quite insufficient."</p></blockquote>
I asked for
	<br><blockquote><p>"real assurances that such appointments" —</p></blockquote>
that is, appointments to health authorities as chairmen, people with a pecuniary interest—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not be made when there is a potential for conflicting interests"— 
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 11 January 1990: c. 136.]</p></blockquote>
In his reply, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I draw … attention to the statutory position, which is clear: under regulations made in 1983. a chairman or member of a health authority is required to declare any pecuniary interest direct or indirect in a contract or any other mater which is the subject of consideration by the health authority. He or she may not then take part in any consideration or discussion of the contract, or any other matter, or vote in any question in respect of it"—
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee,</i> 11 January 1990; c.136-141].</p></blockquote>
That reply does not give me the answer that I sought. I put a clear question to the Minister: would he ensure that people with pecuniary interests in health-care-related matters could not be appointed to the chairmanship of health authorities? That is what people want; they do not want chairmen of health authorities to have direct pecuniary interests in this respect. But the Minister ducked the question in his reply. Will he now give me a straightforward answer? Will he give us an assurance that such people will not be allowed to become chairmen? If he cannot give that assurance, will he explain what will happen if a pecuniary interests arises? The Minister has been warned in Committee that pecuniary interest will inevitably arise—I gave examples, and I could give more examples—and I feel that we are entitled to a full statement from the Minister. Can the Minister give us that assurance before the end of this debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'> Mr. Charles Kennedy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two brief points. First, I would like to thank the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones), in my absence last week, for moving a couple of the amendments standing in my name. May I add that I was extremely grateful last week for the medical care at the non-opted-out Westminster hospital. Long may it continue, because I am not sure that an opted-out basis would permit the standard of service that I enjoyed there. Conservative Members may be grateful; I should not have been back in Committee so quickly, but for the care that I received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, having read in 
	<i>Hansard</i> the ministerial reply to the amendments that were moved and debated last week, it is clear to me, as the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook)— rightly underscored, that there has been absolutely no movement. Conservative Members seem to be satisfied with what the Minister said, but he has given only clarification not assurances. In responding to a provision that deals with the composition and nature of representation on health authorities, the Minister gave only snippets of information, which the Committee—not only the Committee, but the public—is entitled to know anyway. Such partial or marginal disclosure cannot be seen in any sense as an alternative to genuine argument in favour of the manner in which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
Government are proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the government are proceeding is well summed up by a colleague of mine who has served in the House of Commons for more than 25 years. On the subject of health authority or, speaking specificially of Scotland, health board representation, he said that he had never known an Administration of any political persuasion which had been so blatantly partisan in its selection of members and dismissal of existing serving member on health boards and health authorities. That is indisputable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) was revealing, because the Government's first criterion is whether he—it is usually he, but sometines she—is one of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not necessarily saying that someone who could be classed as one of them is incapable, does not care about the Health Service or is unable to do a decent job as chairman or a serving member of a health authority. But that should not be the primary consideration. The decision should rest on a person's capability; political affiliation, if any, should come later, it should not be predominant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention gave it away: the crucial litmus test for Ministers in Wales, England and Scotland in deciding on membership of health authorities is political affiliation. If there are diligent, good serving, able people on health authorities it is despite their political affiliation rather than because of it, and that is sickening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Minister attitudes have become corrosive after a decade in power Several months ago 
	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> published an illuminating feature that highlighted the public appointments at the disposal of the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Scotland, the Secretary of State's power to make appointments is shares by Ministers south of the border. It is staggering how many aspects of Scottish public life such as community representation and civic commitment have become distorted. They are positions of appointees within the gift of the Secretary of State or they reflect an obvious political hue. That is deeply disturbing and corrosive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

The hon. Gentleman is right: when given the chance, political parties at every level enjoy the power of political patronage in making appointments. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnston) cited an example of what happened when vacancies occurred in the Highland health board when the Labour Government were in office. My hon. Friend was asked by the then Secretary of State for Scotland to suggest the names of those who might be appointed. My hon. Friend put forward people who were paid-up members

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A knowledge of the local area should be paramount. The Government had an opportunity to build that requirement into the Bill and specifically into this clause, but chose not to do so. The absence of that commitment speaks far louder and more ominously than anything that the Minster has said or anything that appears in black and white in the clause. The Government have increasingly undermined public representation or a sense of civic commitment, whatever its form. The Government are unwilling to accept those who are truly representative of communities and who dare to represent their own political viewpoint or show independence of thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Bodies such as health authorities are supposed to exercise crucial decisions in the public interest. But the Government's political interference is such that those bodies have come to resemble T. S.

What has been said about the clause, and the fact that it has not been amended in one iota, gives us no reassurance and no reason to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may begin be responding to the hon. Member for Newcastle Upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins), who drew the Committee's attention to lines 16 and 17 in clause 1, which deals with the consultation procedure when districts are to be merged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the provision is to simplify the procedure, because there is already an extensive consultation process at regional health authority level before proposals ever reach Ministers in the Department of Health. At present, when there is a proposal to merge two districts, the consultation procedure is repeated when the order is published in draft form and before it is debated, if necessary or appropriate, in Parliament. That is not a sensible way to proceed; it simply repeats the consultation procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. Comprehensive and proper consultation will be organised by the RHA if there are proposals to merge districts or to change district boundaries. It will be responsible for consulting widely—including with community health councils,—before a proposal is submitted to Ministers. Once the Secretary of State reaches a conclusion he must publish an order which is debatable in the House of Commons under the negative resolution procedure. That is a sensible way to proceed. It simplifies what can be a protracted process and helps to aviod duplication in debate. That is the purpose of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central spoke of mergers and rightly drew the Committee's attention to paragraph 3.20 on page 28 of the White Paper, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Larger Districts might eventually become candidates for mergers with Family Practitioner Committees."</p></blockquote>
But dare one say that the boundaries would then be contigous with those of social services committees, certainly in the shire counties? There is much logic behind that. The coterminosity of district health authorities, family practitioner services authorities and social services committees is not on the agenda. The Bill does not provide for a timetable for mergers of districts. At present, we do not intend to provide pressure, leadership or comment on district boundaries. The Bill is silent on that issue. But the hon. Gentleman was right to refer to paragraph 3.20, which deals with the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
As I told my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman), I again give the Committee the firm assurance that community health councils will retain their functions. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central implied that we were relatively silent on the issue, but I am happy to give the Committee that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) spoke about the alignment of community health councils with districts. Again, I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for incorrectly referring to him last week as the hon. Member for Ynys Môn. I hope that that was corrected in the record of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, there is a sensible proposal in Wales to align boundaries of CHCs with those of district health authorities. But no automatic step would be taken to align CHC and DHA boundaries. We may well have to take into account arguments and considerations against automatic alignment in the event of two or three districts being merged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that what he said is almost the alarming thing that he could have said in response to my points? He has clearly flagged up as an ultimate possibility, if not a present intention, the alignment of social services authority boundaries with district health authority, family practitioner services authority and community health council boundaries. In so doing, he has profoundly disrupted community relationships and the integrity, continuity and commitment of NHS management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister has not assured us that the procedures for consultation, which regional health authorities must currently undergo, will be retained with their full weight and direction. His remarks presage a considerable collapse of the community health council system if there were ever a time —it is clearly pointed to—when CHSs, social services authorities and district health authorities were all aligned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. I did not say that it was a long-term plan. I clearly said that it was a possibility and that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central was right to draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 3.20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the coterminosity of community health council and district health authority boundaries, I repeat what I said a short time ago. There is no automatic procedure for alignment. I am trying to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman; there may well be circumstances in which a CHC should contintue to represent a city, a part of a town or a metropolitan area. The boundaries are not exactly the same as those of the district health authority, but because the CHCs job is to monitor performance and represent the patient's voice on the district health authority, it is surely common sense to move in the general direction of coterminosity of boundaries, as has happened in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggested that it is clearly sensible to have coterminosity between community health councils and health authorities, but, with respect, that shows that he has not understood the system that now operates— or, indeed, its success. There seems to be a confusion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
between needing to enable the voice of the community to be heard within the Health Service in Wales and a theoretical need to have a single consumer voice in each health authority area. The idea of a single consumer voice was ridiculed at out last meeting by Conservative Back Benchers. We were told that there is no single consumer voice, nor can there be. But in Wales the community health councils act as a strong and clear voice for the communities in Wales, and we want that to continue. It is the key element in objecting to the merging of community health councils across entirely inappropriate areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I now deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours)? He asked me to give the Committee an assurance that in no circumstances—I paraphrase his words, I hope, correctly—will a chairman or members of district or regional health authorities be appointed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chairmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—chairmen or members of district or regional health authorities—the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I told the hon. Member for Workington very clearly what the present rules on disclosure are, and if there are minor potential conflicts of interest—for example, if the chairman has an interest in a cleaning or catering company—the rules clearly stipulate that the chairman or member may not take part in any discussion on any subject in which he has a pecuniary interest. The chairman or member has to disclose that interest, and that is effective protection for patients and for the wellbeing of the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is to evaluate what constitutes a substantial interest? Is it not possible for the chairman of a health authority, without sitting on the final committee or being the person who accepts the tender, to angle the authority's budget towards expenditure in a certain area where he or his company, perhaps through local monopoly, may inevitably be the recipient of contracts? Surely there should be some way of establishing what is substantial. Furthermore, how do we know the personal interests of chairmen

The Minister's response makes possible what I can describe only as corruption in the management of the Health Service at local level. He knows that that is true.

Friend agree that the people most likely to make effective and successful chairmen of district health authorities are people who, for one reason or another, have taken an interest in the operation of the Health Service over several years? But does he not also agree that transparency in these matters is of considerable importance? I take it from what my hon. Friend said that, in future, chairmen of district health authorities will be encouraged to make their interests very clear, because there is no reason why a chairman of a DHA should not defend any interest that he may have, instead of keeping it under wraps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to put the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye right about National Health Service trust hospitals. The standard of care that he may or may not enjoy—he talked about the Westminster hospital—in NHS trust hospitals will be as good as, if not better than, directly managed hospitals. His snide remarks about Westminster hospital are, I think entirely inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He challenged the principle that I set out very clearly when we debated the amendments to clause 1 that, in making appointments, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and others who appoint will attach the utmost importance to the capability of the individual. That must be the key, as I am sure the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) will agree. It is a bipartisan matter. The capabilities and skills of potential chairmen are to be first and foremost—

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The capability and skill of the potential appointee are clearly most important.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the impression given by the Minister? Far from making snide remarks about Westminster hospital—anyone who listened to me heard the opposite—I paid it tribute and expressed gratitude.

As the Minister is so categoric that in future I, or anyone else who walsk through the Westminster hospital's doors on a a hospital—first basis, will enjoy a better standard of care than now, will he guarantee that?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
He implied snide criticism of the standard of care which we enjoy now at the Westminster hospital and other NHS hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as the Minister paid tribute to his own health authority chairman, will he tell us how many health authority chairmen in England and Wales who are known to be members of other political parties—not his own—have been reappointed within the past 10 years?

asked that no appointments to chairmanships, specifically, would be made of anyone who had any degree of pecuniary interest in areas allied, or related, to health care.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 1, the Government have set out reasons for the proposed amendments and also the membership of district and regional health authorities. We have explained why we want to have smaller authorities and that regulations will be laid before Parliament, once the Bill receives Royal Assent, to deal with the composition and the appointment procedure of the authorities. I have referred hon. Members to the schedules and notes on clauses for an indication of the Government's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said clearly that there must be consultation with social services authorities by both regional and district health authorities. That is the key, and there is no difference between both sides of the Committee about the importance of consultation. The key point is that there is a basic difference between the Opposition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
Members and Conservative Members because the hon. Member for Livingston believes that district and regional health authorities should, in a sense, be mini-parliaments and consist of people who represent different sectional interests and, indeed, local authority representatives as well. We take an entirely different view, which creates a sharp difference of opinion between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe, and clause 1 exemplifies our thinking clearly, that districts and regional health authorities should have managerial responsibility for the Health Service. They cannot be local parliaments or councils with different representatives. It is not true to say - I listened carefully to the argument of the hon. Member for Livingston - that these authorities will not be rooted in the local community. Of course they will. They will have a greater sense of pride in their local hospitals and authorities, whether they are running the authorities or the hospitals, because they will be charged directly. They will have an unambiguous, clarified, separate responsibility that does not exist now. At present there is confusion in their roles and responsibilities. We shall simplify and clarify matters so that their responsibilities are to plan the health care of those in their districts of to manage their hospitals if they are charged with so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set out arguments for clause 1. My hon. Friends are not pressed men and women. They listen to the amendments with great care and they are accountable to their constituents for the way in which they vote. My hon. Friends were persuaded by the logic of my arguments in dealing with the amendments. I invite the Committee to vote on the substantive motion that clause 1 should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cambell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Historically, we have drawn a distinction between people who represent and people who have the power to take decisions. The chairmen of health authorities have the power to take decisions in exactly the same way as Ministers. Ministers, however, are required to ensure that their private interests do not conflict with their public duties. Ministers cannot hold direct stocks or be directors of companies because that ownership and these responsibilities will conflict with their ministerial jobs. Why should that restriction be placed on Ministers but not on the chairmen of regional health authorities? Surely they are doing precisely the same thing by taking decisions about health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State cannot do what the chairman of a health authority can do although, in many ways, their roles are much the same. The Minister has failed to answer that critical question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to make a modest and simple change. I believe that family practitioner committees should have a very different role when the Bill is enacted. They will no longer be solely responsible for the pay and rations of general practitioners and dentists; they will be expected to undertake a much stronger role in monitoring contracts and securing improvements in services through their monitoring of indicative prescribing budgets. The present name is not suggestive of the proper role of the new committees because it implies the wrong type of management. Amendment No. 69, which is a modest proposal, would reflect more fairly the proposed new role of a family practitioner services authority. I commend the amendment to the Committee. I give notice that if the remaining amendments are accepted, I will not make a speech on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to give an encouraging reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already proposes a change in the old family practitioner committees but I regret that we did not go far enough. My experience is that no one knows what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
a family practitioner committee is unless he happens to have had contact with Health Service politics. Anyone who knows the NHS knows that the term is meant to include a community doctor, pharmacist, optician and dentist. But even those terms are not those of the public, who talk of "my doctor, my dentist, my chemist and my optician". Including the word "family" gives a much better description of all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that changing the name will make it easier for the public to recognise the new body. My hon. Friend said that the significance of his amendment is that it will also reflect the substantial change that we are making to the present FPCs. A few years ago they carried out the extremely important but rather routine task of ensuring that all practitioners were paid properly for their work, and that they were neither underpaid not overpaid according to the contracts of the time. In future, the family health services authorities, as my hon. Friend would like them to be called, will have responsibility for assessing the needs of the local population for good family health services, for planning service development and for ensuring that the contracts of all contractors are so managed that services are provided in the most effective possible way. They will have important duties monitoring cash limits and so on, for premises improvements and for other uses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend assure us that they will be able to act more expeditiously than previously to ease out GPs whose standards are not sufficiently high?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will still be responsible for imprtant parts of the disciplinary procedure and for hearing complaints from the public. The more we can do to strengthen the authorities and give them greater responsibility, the more effectively they should be able to undertake that duty. We shall have to ensure that service committee hearings are carried out properly according to the rules, and in the light of natural justice. I agree with my hon. Friend that the authorities should combine encouraging the development of the best practice with chasing up examples of bad practice in their patch and ensuring that either GPs are made to raise their standards or effective action is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the reasons to which I have referred, I have responded to my hon. Friend's amendment in a helpful way. This is the first debate that I have been able to handle. It demonstrates that I am the most reasonable and easy-going of the ministerial team on the Committee. I am inclined to accept the amendment and commend it to my hon. Friends because it will give these authorities a more sensible and intelligible name and underline their important new future role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>No. 71, in page 2, line 32, leave out 'Practitioner' and inset 'Health'.— [Mr. Nicholas Bennett.]</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 2, line 37, leave out (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to the Secretary of State's comments on his concept of management in the National Health Service. The amendment relates to what I have said
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
about district health authorities. It is designed to delete the short-circuiting of consultations about the changes of boundaries of the bodies that will in future be known as family practitioner services authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation is extremely important. It bears directly upon the concept of management being offered. District health authorities—and family practitioner service authorities—will not be branches of Woolworths, Dixons or Currys. They are bodies which represent local communities which are at the centre of local connections, networks and lines of accountability and responsibility that are not necessarily local formally stated in their constitution but accompany the geographical identity that they serve. A measure of accountability is built in to that identity: people belong to a community and share many of its experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 1 and 2 attack that concept from two directions. First, they attack the constitution—the membership—of the body. Secondly, they attack by giving the Secretary of State power to vary the boundaries and abolish the authorities without proper consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not reassured by the Minister's attempt to reassure us that regional health authorities will act as quasi-consultative bodies when changing boundaries. This was not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2, the constitution—the professional and lay membership—of a family practitioner services authority will be determined largely by the RHA. The RHA will judge whether the present boundaries of the former family practitioner committee will survive. We cannot accept that concept of management for two reasons. First, we do not accept that it is happenstance that the bodies are constituted in geographical areas. We are not discussing the rounds of insurance salesmen, or the catchment areas of supermarkets. We are taking about the geographical identities that reflect real communities. Amendment No. 187 seeks a proper consultation procedure in which those communities can debate the future integrity and boundaries of the organisations that serve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the concept of management offered is profoundly corrupting and corrupted. What sort of amangement could operate the complicated new system that the Government propose? The RHA will stand behind the mangement and appoint virtually all the members of the family practitioner services authority. It will be judge and jury of the quality of performance and whether its present geographical boundaries deserve to survive. That is not good management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with most of the complex changes that the Government proposes. If they are serious about delivering the changes, they should not accompany them with a power to enable the Secretary of State—or by proxy—the regional health authority—to abolish DHAs and FPSAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood our proposals in an important respect. It will remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State to decide, in a extreme case, to abolish a family health services authority or to make a major change to the boundaries. The amendment seeks two rounds of consolidation rather than one. In practice the RHA
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
will consult before putting its recommendations to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will take a decision in the light of that consultation, among other things. The hon. Gentleman is mistaken if he believes that the Bill gives all the powers to the RHA or that it eliminates consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied with that reply. I am no great lover of RHAs, but I would be slightly more reassured if the power to determine the future boundaries of DHAs and FPSAs lay with the RHAs. There would then be a regional body in which people could consult and debate which would reflect the geographical identity of the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State says, "We don't have to worry about that because the consultation, power and judgment lies with me." That is not reassuring. The Secretary of State correctly, that the parly stage of consultation on the abolition of DHAs and FPSAs remains. But that is the least effective stage in the consultation procedure; it is virtually a formality. The most effective stage is when people in the communities debate with and consult each other about the future identity of those bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our discussions have centred on the abolition and merging of authorities: I believe that the new powers will be used for that purpose, not to vary the boundaries, as the Bill states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters will weigh with people. Whether or not they have a constitutional right, they have a political right to feel that they belong to the family practitioner committee or DHA in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to establish the present double round of consultations to reassure local people that they will be consulted about the merging of DHAs and FPCs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Dr. Kim Howells 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment no. 187. Subsection 3(b), as the notes on clauses explains,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"removes the requirement of the Secretary of State to consult on an order varying the locality of the proposed family practitioner services authority including an order establishing a new FPSA or abolishing an existing one".</p></blockquote>
Family practitioner committees have evolved organically from the needs of the communities that they serve. They have been shaped and informed by individuals who represent the aspirations and anxieties of patients. They are not static or inflexible organisations which, in some bureaucratic fashion, have resisted progress or change, or manipulated their powers for individual or political gain. Similarly, their boundaries have been defined using local knowledge and experience and in a way that reflects the nature of family practitioner coverage in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The FPCs can claim fairly to speak with authority about the geographical area that they serve. There are considerable fears in Wales that the numbers of family practitioner services authorities will be reduced. The Government have, after all, reduced the number of community health councils in Wales. Subsection (3) has been drafted to provide a potential means by which the Secretary of State regardless of his political colour can erode or modify—for political, financial or bureaucratic purposes—an organisation that accurately
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
reflects the response of patients and potential patients to the provision of health within a defined area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the spirit of democracy in this legislation, or the desire to respond more sensitively to the demands of what the Government refer to as the health market? They are absent. The legislation will mean the erosion of democracy. It will result in the further alienation of those who require the services of FPCs from the decision making that will determine the nature of that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I satisfy the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) and for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not draconian. It does not cut out proper public consultation and there is no hidden intention to pave the way for the abolition of large numbers of family health services authorities or any dramatic change. The Bill was drafted to ensure that the new responsibilities vis-a-vis the family health services authorities will be exercised in a sensible way .
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important change in the Bill is that for the first time regional health authorities will be given overall responsibility for FHSAs. The FHSAs will be accountable to their regions in the way that district health authorities have been. That change has been broadly welcomed by most people because it stops an over-sharp division developing between the hospital and community services, and the family health services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regions will therefore have a new role because they will deal with questions about the abolition of a family health authority or change to its boundaries. We have no experience of that because the regions have not had that responsibility before. However, we have experience—I have had it myself, both as Minister for Health and in my present job—of the regions exercising their role when a proposal has been made to merge a DHA or to alter its boundaries. Our experience is that such changes can be controversial, for the reason that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central has given; local passions tend to be raised. Also, the current procedure for resolving it is tortuous and unnecessary. When a DHA merger is proposed, the regions consult widely before deciding whether to recommend the new authority to the Secretary of State. That happened when, for example, Riverside health authority and Parkside health authority were created in London. The present law requires the Secretary of State to consult all over again before he decides whether to accept the recommendation of the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the quality of the consultation has suffered unnecessarily, because it takes a long time. The Secretary of State is legally obliged to embark on a process of formal public consultation which simply duplicates a process that has already been carried out by the regions. It is not surprising that the same individuals and organisations take a considerable time to submit the views that they sent to the regions in the first place. The Bill has been drafted to eliminated that step, so that when proposals are made to change boundaries, district health authorities and family health service authorities will have one process of public consultation. That will be carried out by the region, which will pass on its recommendation, together with its consultation results, to the Secretary

However, what I have described takes place and it will continue to do so. The guidance is extant and it will be repeated for FHSAs. There will be consultation by the regions before their proposals, and the results of their consultations, are put to the Secretary of State. The amendment would produce for FHSAs the same undesirable arrangement that exist for DHAs, which is that for legal reasons, two rounds of legal consultation take place on the same subject, with the same people being consulted.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Dame Janet. I did not want to stray out of order by discussing schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate about family practitioner committees applies equally to the membership of health authorities. As a Scottish member of the Committee, I know that the combined system that operates in Scotland is much more efficient and sensible. It is a pity that the Government did not take the opportunity of the Bill to extend that principle to England and Wales, instead of just foreshadowing it and thereby dooming management to a further shake up. I can assume only that the Scottish Minister with responsibilities for health failed to advance an argument with his usual persuasiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there are strong arguments for saying that much of the past week's debate is even more relevant to FPCs in that they oversee the provision and standards of front-line care for most people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only four years since the Government changed the function of FPCs and now they are altering their structure too. It is too early to impose yet another radical change. The system will not settle and will not be properly evaluated when there is a continuing revolution of the functions and structures of the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government call the additional tasks a further demonstration of their confidence in the management potential of the FPCs. That sentiment is wrecked by the fact that the new tasks come with an entirely new management structure. That would appear to be a vote of no confidence in the management of FPCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new tasks include the oversight of vital areas such as practice budgets and indicative drug budgets. Yet at the same time as introducing these new concepts, which will have a major impact on local health care provision for most people, the Government are taking steps to ensure that FCPs lose their local accountability and representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Select Committee on Social Services wrote about health authority membership is equally applicable to FPC membership:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is curious that the White Paper whose objective is working for patients' and improving the responsiveness of the service to local needs should remove elements of local accountability rather than strengthen them…some form of local representation must be maintained."</p></blockquote>
That was the all-party Select Committee on Social Services which has an in-built Conservative majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering the worries of one FPC— Suffolk—as reported to the Select Committee. Its worries should carry more weight with the Government because it supports the aim of the Government to strengthen the management role of FPCs and reduce the numbers. Suffolk thought that an important criterion was that members were well acquainted with the area of the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was supported by the Society of Family Practitioner Committees, another broad supporter of what the Government are trying to achieve. The society has written:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Also important, however, is ensuring that these members have
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
strong local connections so that in managing the Family practitioner services they can have an informed view as to the needs of the local community. The role of community health councils as a source of consumer representation and view points whilst useful and welcome, is no substitute for members of the Committee having personal knowledge of the area".</p></blockquote>
Each member of the Committee would probably echo that view in terms of his own constituency. It is self-evidently important. Only those who are part of the community can fully appreciate the needs of the area and ensure that the service is provided. Indeed the Department of Health has acknowledged that by stating that FCPs will have to be involved with the region in setting practice budgets because of their detailed local knowledge. The only reason why the Government might resist that suggestion is their fear that in some areas they might not find suitable candidates off the Conservative Central Office list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suffolk also supported an increase in the membership of GPs to two. It felt that that was required to ensure sufficient medical representation, even if that meant also increasing lay membership. It is not a matter of protecting the rights of GPs, though as independent contractors it is clearly important that they are fully represented. It is still more important to ensure that FPCs have a sufficient depth of medical knowledge to make the right decisions. The workings of the indicative drug budget, for instance, will require medical input to ensure that it is realistic given the medical needs of the area. A doctor from one practice may cater for an area with different needs and circumstances from other FPC practices. Membership should ensure that different but equally valid medical perspectives are heard. If one is trying to improve the NHS at its frontline or coalface and if one is genuinely anxious to work for patients, that point should commend itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving on to amemdment No. 196, it should also be a stipulation that the dentist on the FPC should be in the NHS, because only an NHS dentist will fully appreciate the needs of the majority of dental patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Society of Family Practitioner Committees also supports increased professional representation, despite its support for the new slimmed-down committees. It urges that an ophthalmic practitioner be a member. It regards the ophthalmic service as an important, if small, part of the service. Amendment No. 196 would provide for that. The new committees must understand what is both medically possible and desirable, and should have, therefore, as wide a medical representation as possible. Efficient management may be ignorant if it is not properly informed. All key professional areas within the Health Service at such a level have a crucial role to play in ensuring that management decisions are informed, and not made in ignorance or as the result of oversight. In that way we can avoid bad management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suffolk's main anxiety was about the ability of members to cope with the extra demands that a small committee will impose. FPCs have many functions, such as surgery inspection, lay conciliation, medical audit advisory committees, and so on. The slimming-down exercise is likely to militate against the proper discharge of those functions, and I hope that later in the debate the Government can show that they have not closed fully the lines of communication. Even if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
they will not act on the matter at present, perhaps they will do so in the—future though I hope that they will not be in power that long—if, as I suspect, reducing the number of committee members leads to functions being carried out less thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This view is supported by the Select Committee, which believes that the decision to reduce numbers will put a greater burden on remaining members—that is self-evident and logical—and make responding to and investigating patient complaints more difficult. We hear much about patients' rights and responsiveness to the consumer. I do not like such Government rhetoric being used about the NHS, because of its connotations, but there is nothing consumerist about reducing the ability of the committees to respond to formal complaints, representations, or expressions of anxiety from individual patients. Patients rights will suffer under the slimming-down procedure when extra burdens have to be carried on fewer shoulders. I suspect, judging from an earlier debate, that the political breadth of those shoulders will be scaled down in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burdens on members will have a detrimental effect on the general service, but the consequences will be potentially disastrous if none of the members has front-line, professional experience, either. FPCs play an important role, for instance, in assessing GP's referral needs, and years of dealing with a particular doctor and area would give them a better perspective on information received. The Department has suggested that there will be continuity, but that should be built into the Bill and made explicit. Clause 2 is deficient in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point underlies amendments Nos. 196 and 197, to which I hope the Government will respond positively at the conclusion of the debate. Without the changes the clause is grossly deficient and it will not meet the needs of patient services at community level or, ironically, even meet the Government's aspirations, as reflected in the wording of the Bill and the ministerial rhetoric that has accompanied it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our amendments, which have been included with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr Kennedy), are important. They go to the heart of the operation of the family health services authority which, in turn, goes to the heart of the family doctor service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State said earlier, the FHSAs will have an important role in encouraging best practice in the family doctor service and in chasing out worst practice. The family doctor service is a good service. Nevertheless, work needs to be done to improve its quality of care and preventive aspects, to increase the promotion of good health and to improve responsiveness to the GP's patients. Although the service is very good, we are not complacent about it. It should be overseen and promoted by the family practitioner committee, as it is now known, or the FHSA as it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that what will happen will parallel what we think will happen to FHSAs to district health authorities. We fear that any vestige of local representatives will be removed and, instead, managerial and commercial interests will take precedence. From
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
the debates so far it is clear that Conservative Members think that local responsiveness is bad and will somehow interfere with good management. But there cannot be good management in the interests of local services if it does not respond to the interests and needs of those who use the services. Management does not exist in a vacuum; it exists to deliver the services that people want. If the body that defines what people want and how those services are provided has no connection with users of the services, however good the management is it is fundamentally flawed. We are worried that local representatives—the voice of the patient and users of the services—will be removed in favour of the cult of commercialisation and managerial interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give some examples. We are anxious about access to GP's services. It is still difficult for disabled people to gain access to many surgeries because, for example, of flights of steps down to a surgery in the basement. In some surgeries, it is difficult for a mother to wait with her children: there may be nowhere for her to change her baby's nappy and she may have to choose between placing her baby on the floor of the toilet or in the middle of the waiting room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business men who will fill up the FHSAs will never, I guarantee, have tried to negotiate a double buggy into a GP's surgery. They will not have had to wonder whether other patients have noticed the terrible smell from the baby's nappy and whether the best course is to leave it or to change the baby on the floor in front of everyone. That will not have been part of they daily experience of life. Those business men will not be disabled people who, when deciding whether to go to the doctor, wonder whether it is best simply to carry on suffering at home or to make a difficult journey and then encounter the problem of getting into the surgery. These issues are important and the Government's view of the FHSAs future is wrong. The people on the FHSAs will not be those who have experienced using such services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gender is important. Whether caring for elderly people, for their children or for their own health, women are far the the greatest users of family doctor services. Yet I guarantee that if the clause remains unamended, boards almost entirely composed of men-like district health authorities—will decide about those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is outcome. The most important aspects of the family doctor service are the quality of decision-making about treatment and diagnosis, the quality of patient care and the decision whether GPs themselves should manage a patient or send him or her to hospital for futher tests and treatment. Outcome and the quality of care provided by GPs are critical. If the boards that manage the GP service are stuffed full of managers and people who know about commerce, business and industry but not about medicine and GPs' services, the quality of care by family doctors' services will not improve as we would wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It exists to deliver efficiently and effectively services that are needed, accessible and of high quality. Unless management is in touch with those issues, it will not provide the services that are wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listed all the factors which I think those with whom the Government are planning to stuff the Committees will not know. They will not know about problems of access or of surgery opening times and waiting times or about medical issues and the quality of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will know however, about all the things in which the Government are really interested - for example cash limits on premises, as we saw in the Health and Medicines Act 1988. Another example is cash limits on ancillary staff, with which we were confronted in the same Act. Cash limits on drugs budgets are planned in the Bill; the people on the boards will be ace at knowing how to pursue that. They will know about higher pay for longer lists and how to encourage GPs to take on more patients and longer lists so that ultimately the Secretary of State can use the power granted to him later in the Bill to limit the number of GPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Family health services authorities' members and officers will all be finely tuned to deal with cash limits but they will have no idea about, or interest in, issues relating to quality of care, which should be the essence of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a context of strong pressure to drive down costs with no counterbalancing pressure to safeguard quality, it is incredibly important that the membership of FHSAs reflects, can be an advocate for, and protects those who need the services in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way the Government talk about quality of care is disgraceful. Where, in the structure of the family doctor service and the family health services—either the members of the board or the managers operating below the board, is the guarantee about quality assurance and audit? What resources will those committee members have to monitor the quality of the GP services? What assurances can the Government give about such resources? How will they be organised? Who will carry out the important epidemiological search for family doctor work? It will hardly be carried out by members on the board, who will spend all their time working out how to dock the pay of GPs who overspend their indicative drug budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very interesting to listen to the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will support the amendment that seeks medical involvement in the family health services authorities. That is one way of including audits at the planning and delivery stage of the services. I admit that I did not quite follow the hon. Gentleman's intervention, because it seemed to support, not oppose, what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled an important amendment about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
complaints procedure. For all their talk about the interests of patients, the Government have never shown any interest in what happens when things go wrong. When we have asked how many patients complain or how long it takes to investigate a complaint against a GP, the Government say that they do not know because the information is not collected centrally. That is why we carried out our own survey on the way in which complaints against GPs are dealt with, and as we discovered, the practice varies considerably from area to area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wrote to each family practitioner committee asking how many complaints were received each year, how long it took to resolve the complaints, and what was the outcome of each case. Sixty per cent. of FPCs responded, so we were given a clear picture—certainly a much clearer one than that which the Government have. There are significant variations between authorities on the number of complaints that they received. For example, some received only four complaints in a year, while one received 448. The authority that receives the fewest complaints may not necessarily be the one where GPs work best, but it may be the one where no one knows how to make a complaint. We discovered that the time that it takes to deal with a complaint varies enormously. One FPC area expected to deal with all complaints, including informing the complainants of the outcome, in 11 weeks. Others average a year to deal with complaints, though obviously the time that is taken is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to ensure that the complaints procedure is simple and easy to understand. The procedure, in practice, seems to encourage confrontation; there is no guarantee that a simple explanation of the outcome of the complaint will be delivered; and the procedure is inflexible. Given the importance that we attach to the complaints procedure, we believe that every FHSA should have one member and one officer tagged with responsibility for working with GPs, the Department of Health and other authorities to handle complaints. Even if the Government take the same unreasonable view on the membership of family health authorities that they take of DHAs, I hope that they will not reject our important amendments relating to complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall dip back briefly into the question of the importance of representation because a page of my notes appears in the wrong order. I shall try to help Conservative Members who are hung up about management and do not understand it in context. I cite as an example services for ethnic minority communities. I ask the Minister to think about his comment about management in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People from ethnic minority communities have a different experience of health care from everyone else's for a number of reasons. First, they are susceptible to different diseases in some instances. For example, people of African origin are more susceptible to sickle cell anaemia problems. People of Mediterranean origin have a greater risk of thalassaemia. There is a greater susceptibility to different diseases among ethnic groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, people from abroad come with a different diet and way of life. For this reason, they sometimes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
have different illnesses. Tuberculosis is more prevalent among Asian peoples. The country from which they come would have a bearing on their diseases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the language barrier can be a problem. Fourthly, people from differing cultural backgrounds have different patterns of use of services and different expectations of what health services should do for them. I understand that Moroccan people are likely to consult a doctor at the first sign of a minor illness whereas Asian people have a well-developed practice of self-treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task of a manager is to manage effectively the provision of such services. He should account of the four factors to which I have referred. How will someone who has parachuted in from the Air Force or brought in from industry approach the role?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking not about Sainsbury's or about shopping but about the family doctor service. The hon. Gentleman illustrated the problem well: the Government are applying Sainsbury's principles and hoping that the result will be a better family doctor service. I guarantee that if they try to run the family doctor service like Sainsbury's—

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady. I wish to hear what she says, and there is sufficient noise on both sides of the Committee to make that difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Harman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are worried that the boards will not be representative and that lack of representation will be exacerbated by the sort of people who will be employed as managers of the family health services authorities. We are anxious because of the appointments to family practitioner committees that have been made in the recent past. Business people cannot be appointed because they are not paid enough, so people from the armed forces run the committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage the authorities being run by a load of business men whose orders are carried out by a load of ex-service people. Michael Gaffney, for example, the new general manager of the Buckinghamshire family practitioner committee, has much relevant experience because he was a colonel in the Royal Engineers. In 1985, 13 military men were appointed as health authority general managers. The newly-appointed general manager of the Kingston and Richmond family practitioner committee, Peter Hornby, has considerable relevant experience. He was in the Royal Engineers for 21 years and he does not find National Health Service work different from being in the Army. He said that he was attracted to the NHS
	<br><blockquote><p>"because it was looking for people with management qualities but did not demand relevant experience".</p></blockquote>
If neither managers nor members of the authority have relevant experience, how on earth will they deal with the critical issues that affect patients?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Peter Hornby, Kingston and Richmond's general manager, continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the Army, deadlines were there to be met but you get a great deal of satisfaction in meeting deadlines."</p></blockquote>
Commander Edward Jones had relevant experience, too. He spent 31 years in the police force. Brigadier James Dennis was formerly in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers—when I spoke about managers being parachuted in, it was too close to the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's only clear objective appears to be cost-cutting. That is evident in the Bill and in the Health and Medicines Act 1988. The amendment would insert into legislation on the family health services authorities the objectives of local responsiveness, concern about quality and sensitivity and promptness in dealing with complaints. Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 219, which is tabled in my name. It concerns the composition of family practitioner services authorities in Wales. In particular, I shall reflect on the current composition and the way in which changes are being proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should look at the current composition of family practitioner committees which have 30 members: a chairman, eight to represent the medical profession, three to represent dentists, two pharmacists, an optician, four local authority representatives, four to represent the district health authorities and seven others who are generally lay people. Therefore, 22 people represent the professions, there are seven lay people and an independent chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is a strong professional element in the current memberships of the committtees. The new proposals set out in the White Paper are for a chairman who, for authorities in Wales, will be appointed by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
Secretary of State, four professional members appointed by the appropriate professional bodies, five lay members and a chief executive who will be appointed by the chairman and the lay members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, although the new set-up is included in the White Paper, the Bill is extremely vague about the matter. Paragraph 11(5) of schedule 1, which refers to Wales, merely states:

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>"(a) a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State:</li>

	<li> (b) a prescribed number of members appointed by him; and</li>

	<li> (c) the chief officer of the Authority:</li>

	<li> (d) such other officers as may be prescribed".</li>
</div> <!-- ul -->
Therefore, nothing is written in the clause or the schedule to satisfy us that professional organisations will be represented on the committee. Will the Minister confirm that members of professions will be included in the new set-up as was envisaged in the White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question for the Committee is not whether the overwhelming domination of the current committees by the professional bodies should continue—strong arguments have been accepted by the professions that perhaps the current balance is overwhelmingly in favour of professional interests—but whether the present balance envisaged in the White Paper is a good replacement. In other words, have the Government achieved the right balance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main danger of the new proposal is that the FPSAs will come under the control of central Government and, in Wales, under the control of the Welsh Office. We have already deployed arguments about the appointment of members to the new health authorities, and again this is an example of the Government taking into their control the appointment of members whom they want to sit on the committees and who can be trusted to carry out Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government no longer appear to believe in a pluralist society. At least the existing system gives us a Government of one political persuasion and a local authority of another with representatives on committees. That reflects plurality and the way in which political parties are supported by the local community. The new system takes that away completely because, yet again, the Government believe that appointments should be made on the basis of whether people are "one of us" and not on the contribution which they can make to the decision-making process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly believe that the voice of the contractor should be retained on the new committees and we would welcome an assurance from the Minister. The contractor's voice must also be retained in an acceptable manner. The committee that administers the general practitioners' contract should contain membership from the professional body which represents those contractors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new authorities should be seen as a partnership between the contractors, the GPs, health authorities and the Government, because the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
has overall responsibility, and also the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that there will be confrontation, not partnership, and a drastic reduction in the contractor's voice in the decision-making process. That will mean that doctors will not work in partnership with the authority, and the Government as its paymaster, and that will create confrontation. The Government, however, are well used to that state of affairs. I commend the view that co-operation, especially in the delivery of health care, is far preferable to confrontation. I urge the Government to accept amendment No. 219, which seeks to amend schedule 1 to provide a place for the professional bodies and for the local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that they want to keep the medical profession, in relation to the authority, at arm's length. That is far more likely to put them into a confrontational position than if they were to regard the medical profession as partners developing a service. I urge the Government to accept an amendment that seeks to embody that partnership in the Bill rather than to place the medical profession outside the system and force it into a confrontational role rather than one of co-operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek to prolong the discussion of the amendments because most of the ground was covered when we discussed the composition of health authorities. I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate we shall receive similar responses to those given in reply to an earlier debate. We must know what the Government's thinking is in respect of the new authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper, we were told specifically that there would be four professional members, a doctor in general practice, a dentist, a community pharmacist and a nurse with experience of community care. Similarly, unlike the health authority provision, the same professions are suggested in our notes on the Bill. However, that does not appear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that certain informal undertakings may have been given and if it is not possible, for reasons that can be explained to us, for those intentions to be included in clause 2 or schedule 1, will the Minister at least give the Committee assurances to this effect to place the Government's intention on the record about who should serve on these committees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I place particular emphasis on the point made by the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) about the position of doctors who have a special relationship with the authorities as independent contractors. It is important for doctors to be involved and have some input into the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, I hope that he will make the position of professional people, espcially doctors, on these authorities abundantly clear and so put their minds at rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
