	<div class='legislation'>Building (Amendment) Regulations 2002</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website was not up and running yesterday, so a fortnight on from the resignation of the then Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions we still do not know precisely what ministerial responsibilities have been allocated within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Indeed, we do not even know precisely what the Department covers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give a good example. We hear this morning that the Health and Safety Executive is unhappy that it has been split between the Department for Transport and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. We do not know how it has been split. The Health and Safety Executive has a role in overseeing how the building regulations are implemented. I ask you, Mr. O'Brien, to urge the Minister to get the Department's website up and running. I tabled a question two days ago on the subject, and I would like an assurance from the Minister that it will be answered forthwith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that that is not the responsibility of the Chairman. However, his point has been made and I am sure that it will be noted. Hopefully, action will be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. Paragraph 6 of the explanatory note to the regulations says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in respect of these Regulations. A copy may be obtained from Buildings Regulations Division, DTLR".</p></blockquote>
We have had a problem twice before with the old Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Once, maps and, another time, a regulatory impact assessment relating to a statutory instrument were not made available in the Library. I want to start with a good relationship with the new Minister and the new Department, and I make the point gently: it is a courtesy to the Committee, if nothing else, that the documents relating to a statutory instrument be freely available in the Library, so that we can come to the debate properly informed. I should be grateful if the Minister would ensure that the documents are available in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I am perhaps slightly less generously spirited than my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). I have been to debates on a series of statutory instruments relating to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the DTLR, and a pattern has developed in which documents are not being made available until after the statutory instrument has been discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be declaring a vested interest in the issue before us when we come to the substantive issue, but the regulations are terribly controversial stuff, about which there is strong feeling in the building industry. If the Government have made a regulatory impact assessment that considers what impact they think the regulations will have, it seems extraordinary that we are debating them without it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is taking note of the comments, and that the points made are being recorded. There is nothing more that I, as Chairman, can do, so I wish to continue with the business of the Standing Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.33 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002, No. 440).</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to raise the issue of the regulations this morning. We can now be clear that the Minister is in charge of windows, so we are making progress on his responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prayer that gave rise to this Standing Committee debate was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). He would have liked to speak this morning, but unfortunately he is away on parliamentary business this week. It therefore falls to me as co-proposer of the prayer to speak on the subject. I do not wish to steal the Minister's thunder by explaining at length the provisions of the regulations that we are considering, but it is important to state that we are principally dealing not with changes to building regulations per se, but with the self-certification schemes that are introduced by means of this legislation in order to apply those regulations. Most hon. Members welcome the advent of self-certification schemes, where they are appropriate—and certainly where they can reduce the amount of regulation and cost that is incurred by businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to this legislation, the main problem seems to have been caused by the Government's remarkable failure to consult with relevant sectors of the business community. As a result of that, there has been much disquiet. That is evidenced by the fact that 110 hon. Members have so far signed the prayer that constitutes early-day motion 1099, which stands in my name and those of other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations cover four specific areas of work in the building trades: solid fuel combustion appliances and associated equipment; oil-fired combustion appliances and associated equipment; foul and surface water drainage; and replacement windows, or refenestration as it is sometimes rather grandly referred to—as opposed to defenestration, which was an excellent means of removing Governments. We wish to address only the last of those four areas, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
there has been substantial consultation on the first three areas, and it is generally agreed that there is little problem with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with regard to replacement windows that the Government have fallen down in the consultation processes. This matter has been debated in Parliament: we are coming late to it, because it was discussed in another place on 13 May. Therefore, there has already been some debate between Ministers and Lords about the subject that we are discussing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reiterate, we would all welcome a self-certification scheme that enables businesses to carry out their activities without their work having to be passed by building inspectors from local authorities. Therefore, a process of self-certification has the potential to be of benefit. However, what is extraordinary is the way in which the Government chose to undertake their responsibilities to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9:1 of the regulatory impact assessment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The representatives of small businesses were consulted".</p></blockquote>
However, unfortunately, representatives of the wrong small businesses were consulted. For instance, the House Builders Federation was consulted, but one does not need to be an intellectual giant to realise that it is concerned with new buildings, and we are talking about replacement windows. That is not its members' core business—or its members' business at all. However, the Government failed to consult with either the Federation of Small Businesses or the Federation of Master Builders, both of which are directly concerned with a large number of replacement windows, and it is possible that that will be a growing trade as people become more aware of energy efficiency, which we hope will be the case, and therefore replace their windows, either on an ad hoc or on a programmed basis. It is extraordinary that the Government failed to consult those federations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's defence is that the major window companies were consulted, and there is no doubt that that was the case. Indeed, the fenestration self-assessment scheme, about which we shall hear more, covers the market leaders and the majority of glaziers throughout the country. It undertakes the majority of work. About 70 per cent. of domestic window replacement work is undertaken by members of the Glass and Glazing Federation. A large part of the industry was consulted, but thousands of small builders who inevitably undertake window replacement as part of their work were not consulted. Worse than that, the Government did not inform them that they proposed to introduce a self-certification scheme for replacement windows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a clear consultation process over several years about the three other parts of the regulations, culminating in substantive agreements in 1999. However, at no time during those proposals were replacement windows cited as a potential subject for deregulation and self-certification. Since 1999, there has been no hint of that either. We are seeing the introduction of a self-certification scheme about which the Government have chosen to consult a substantial part of the replacement trade, but only those
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
companies that are involved mainly with the complete replacement of windows in a dwelling, not the odd replacement of single windows that are often the province of the smaller builder. There was no statement given to the wider trade that the proposals would be introduced. We now have a fait accompli in respect of the introduction of the regulations. I am sure that it will be argued cogently that to reverse them now would create great chaos within the industry. I accept that it is not sensible to rip up what has been proposed and start again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes the Committee an explanation of why the Government were so deficient in the consultation process. We need to know how those processes will take place in future. There is a problem between the old Departments—the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions—which seem to have been involved in different ways in the process. Now that part of such responsibility seems to be with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, I have no confidence that matters will improve. We need to know how they will be managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most important that the Minister supports two views that were expressed by Lord Filkin in another place, who agreed that Ministers from the old Department and presumably now the new Department would meet representatives of small builders to consider their worries and to see whether improvements in the design of the self-certification scheme could be introduced in order to build on what already exists. The least that the Government can do is to try to mitigate the circumstances that they have created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the costs to the small trader. The argument for self-certification is that it is a cheaper as well as a more effective option and that, eventually, it will produce savings for the trader and, therefore, for the consumer. I hope that that will occur. However, I note that there is an estimated £150 cost for a small builder who enters the scheme, and attendant costs will be associated with future work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for small builders is that they will not be involved in only one self-certification scheme. Builders' nature means that they will turn their hands to a variety of tasks that are set by people who contract them. Many small builders will have to register with several self-certification schemes, which would mean that what is often a one or two-man operation would incur a substantial cost. That might make the builder uncompetitive compared with those whom we all want to drive out of the business: those often described as cowboy builders who want cash in hand. It has been argued that the regulations will help to make life difficult for such people due to the need for certification before the exchange of contracts when selling a house and because people will be less inclined to use builders who cannot produce certification because it would make their property less saleable in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that argument, but we grant no favours if we make the person who sticks by the rules less competitive than the person who rides roughshod over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the rules. The situation is all right for large double glazing companies. They will have no problem complying with the regulations; indeed, they were principle consultees in the production of the regulations. The problem will be encountered by people who try to make a living though small-scale local building contracts. They will discover that they have additional overheads that might make them uncompetitive. Will the Minister examine whether there could be consolidation of the self-certification of different types of work in order to reduce bureaucracy and costs to a small trader who satisfies the conditions for the different types of their work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister assures me that those two things will happen, I shall be less inclined to press the motion to a Division. Changes of regulations that improve energy efficiency in homes—that is the basis of the changes to the original regulations—and any self-certification scheme that reduces the need to involve local government bureaucracy and its attendant costs are good things. I want measures that help, rather than hinder, the small business man. As the Government did not consult properly, they have laid themselves open to the charge that they have failed in that respect. In fact, they have demonstrated that they do not understand the very trades that they are trying to regulate, which is an even more worrying aspect of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposals are controversial and far-reaching. They would amend building regulations to require self-certification for all those who replace windows, roof lights, roof windows and doors to all buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest because I am a chartered surveyor. My profession will undoubtedly have to sort out some of the problems that the regulations present. Fees will be charged for that, although sadly I doubt that many of those fees will come my way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start where the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) started. This morning we received a serious charge from the Federation of Master Builders about poor consultation. It is a substantial body whose comments are serious and deserve proper consideration. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the consultation process prior to the drafting of Statutory Instrument (SI) 440 was inadequate. Instead of limiting consultation to Building Regulations Advisory Committee and specialist associations, the consultation should have been much wider to include the representatives of the tens of thousands of construction firms that work in the general building trade. The FMB and FSB were not consulted. Together, these two Federations represent at least 20,000 firms, or around 20 per cent. of the total that are involved daily in the types of work covered by the SI."</p></blockquote>
That seems to amount to a major failing on behalf of the Government to consult those who will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Library brief, in Scotland
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under Section 4 of the Building (Scotland) Act 1959 a class relaxation direction has been proposed for between three months and eighteen months in respect of windows, doors and roof lights being replaced in existing"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
buildings
	<br><blockquote><p>"or installed in alterations or extensions to existing"</p></blockquote>
buildings. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is in order to give the relevant industry sectors time to comply with the more stringent U-values in Column B of Table 1 to Technical Standard J3.2 of the sixth amendment to the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990, which will take effect from 4 March 2002."</p></blockquote>
Why is the Scotland Office prepared to give its industry between three and 18 months to adjust to what are very far-reaching proposals while we are considering a proposal that the Government rushed through and which came into effect on 1 April? The Minister needs to answer that charge. That seems an extraordinary way of doing business. The fear is that that will be used as a precedent in future to rush through further regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several detailed points to put to the Minister. Phil Davies of Davies & Tate, a firm in Kent that has been supplying windows to the trade for 25 years and installs them, wrote to the Department to say that small companies are finding life extremely difficult since the regulations came into force. The price and supply of coated glass is proving to be a major problem. Davies & Tate sales are down 25 per cent. since 1 April. The year-on-year business of a major supplier, Griffin Windows, is down 11 per cent. since 1 April, and its sales are down 600 a week. The statutory instrument is having a major effect on the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument tells us that the Department has carried out a regulatory impact assessment. I suspect that the regulations will cost the industry, and above all, sadly, the consumer, a great deal of money. We need to know precisely what the benefits will be. How much will the regulations cost the industry, consumers and local authorities, which will have to administer the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme involves self-certification and Fensa, but in some cases, the scheme will not apply to a particular window, and building regulations will have to be applied for. The fee will have to cover those situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will police the regulations? I assume that the local authority will, so we need to know how much it will cost them. If, as I am certain, it will cost over and above the fees, will the Minister guarantee that they will be fully reimbursed, or is this another example in the long catalogue of Government requirements on local authorities that are not properly funded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the scheme is self-certified, but an issue is associated with it that relates to insurance. I understand that all those people wanting to be registered with Fensa must also have the Fensa quality assured insurance. We have heard from the Quality Assured National Warranties and Insurance Guarantee Association, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this category, it is a minimum requirement of FENSA membership that guarantee insurance is offered to every customer. The DTLR have not advised how this offer must be made as there are inherent dangers in doing so. The regulatory authorities who oversee the insurance industry i.e. the General Insurance Standards Council and the Financial Services Authority state quite simply that any person or company who offers or advises on any insurance product must be registered with either authority.

—thereby increasing the costs of registration still further. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By giving the insurance cover, you avoid any doubt regarding offering, selling or advising upon any aspect of insurance. It also avoids any concerns regarding premium collection etc. If you automatically give your client insurance on all contracts, the premium will be£10 plus 5 per cent.… Alternatively, if you decide to only offer the insurances, the premium will vary between £12 and £15 plus"</p></blockquote>
insurance premium tax. The insurance element alone costs some £10 a window, so one can begin to see that the scheme will be very expensive on behalf of the insurers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, costs will be increased for small businesses. Installers of new windows in existing houses need to register with Fensa, which will cost £100. They will then need to pay an annual membership fee of £50, an inspection charge of £100, a vetting fee of £200 and a revetting fee, if required, of £50. Surely, the only way for businesses to absorb such costs is to pass them on to the consumer through price increases. That is exactly what will happen. Will the Government tell us what the benefit will be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the regulations be policed? A body of opinion believes that if any builder—one self-employed man, perhaps—has to go through the regulations and charge more for the windows that he installs, cowboy builders will be encouraged. Will the Minister tell us how he will stop them? Will we have an army of window snoopers going round the country looking for windows that have been installed in houses? When they have found them, for how many years after the event will it be possible to enforce the regulations? What will be the penalties? We need answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled questions to the Government in preparation for this Committee, long before the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) made his prayer. One of the concerns is who will supply the glass, because it seems that Pilkington's K glass is the only readily commercially available glass that meets these regulations at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one of the answers to those questions, the Government said that they were aware of three alternative firms, but I am not aware that those firms are yet able to supply the glass commercially to meet these regulations. I have a copy of a letter that states that the price of Pilkington's K glass mysteriously increased by 8 per cent. on 1 April—precisely the day on which these regulations came into force—so it seems as though Pilkington may be using its monopoly position to extort money from the consumer. The Government need to keep that carefully under review, and if they find that that monopoly position is being abused, they will need to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did not the Government consider using the simpler kite mark system instead of these complicated regulations? The British Standards Institution told me that it would be absolutely confident that it could produce a kite mark that would do exactly the same job as these regulations. If 10 years ago, when the Government introduced safety glass to stop children
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
falling through windows—a huge and tragic danger—they were perfectly happy that that problem could be solved by using a kite mark, why on earth cannot the problem of U values and insulation be solved with a simple kite mark system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our correspondents has said that the only proper way to find out whether people have complied with these regulations is to remove the window and carry out laboratory tests on the frame, the glass and how the glass has been installed in the frame. There is no proper way to find that out when the window is in position. So why on earth are not windows sold with a simple kite mark system? The British Standards Institution has assured me that that could be done perfectly satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having criticised the Government for not consulting properly, I should like to deal with another issue. There are 20,000 builders, many of whom, even now, may not be aware of these horrific regulations. How will the Government advertise these regulations and ensure that builders have a chance to comply with them? May I give the Minister an idea: why do we not place in every builders merchant—B&Q and the rest of them—a simple notice to alert builders and consumers who might purchase windows to the existence of these regulations? That would be a simple and good first step to alerting the general public about their existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to this costs business because this whole issue revolves around costs. I asked the Government what the costs would be. One of the slightly anomalous written answers that I received from the Minister's predecessor, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The cost for all installations of new windows in existing buildings through the need for installers to obtain members of the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme was estimated at £1,715,000, against savings of £91,885,000 in the first year."</p></blockquote>
The cost to the consumer will be £1.75 million, but the Government estimate that the saving will be £91 million, and I should like the Minister to explain how the Government justify that curious figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no cost for applying for regulation permission, as none of those registered with these schemes is required to give a building notice and pay a fee".—[
	<i>Official Report</i>, 22 April 2002; Vol. 384, c. 44W.]</p></blockquote>
That is a semantic playing with words. If circumstances dictate that either the installer is not registered with Fensa or is unable to comply with the Fensa requirements—for example, the building may be listed and the window may be a particularly difficult one—he will have to apply for building regulations consent and there will be a fee. I should like the Minister to confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to listed buildings. In an answer to a different question on 22 April, the Minister's predecessor said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For building work comprising replacing windows guidance on compliance with the Building Regulations is given in Approved Documents LI and L2. This includes guidance on what is reasonable provision for listed buildings. In addition to this, my Department has been working closely with English Heritage on a new publication advising on making reasonable energy efficiency provisions in conservation work. The publication is aimed at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
building control inspectors as well as builders, and I understand it will be published soon."—[
	<i>Official Report</i>, 22 April 2002; Vol. 384, c. 43W–44W.]</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister could tell us when that document will be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might also pay particular attention to the fear that the regulations will drive through windows and doors that are not appropriate for listed buildings. I shall give one example. The character and vernacular of many Georgian buildings is especially retained by the thinness of the glazing bars. Thicker glazing bars will be required to meet the regulations, because one cannot install double-glazed units with those thin glazing bars. The Minister needs to consider such matters of detail carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed how the regulations will be enforced. Will the Minister clarify how the provisions will work when a house is sold? As I understand it, every new window, door, roof-light and so on will have to have a certificate when it is installed. Theoretically, when a house is sold, the householder will have one or more of those certificates for windows replaced after 1 April. Will the Minister confirm that that is how he expects conveyancing to take place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the local authority become involved in seeing those certificates? As I know from having practised in that field, damp certificates, which are very useful in conveyancing, are often the last document available because they have been lost, and yet they are an important guarantee. We need to know how the system is going to work. It is all very well to have a Fensa installer, but what happens when he installs a window and a DIY enthusiast, or another builder, makes an alteration to it, replacing the damp-proof course, for example? Would it make a difference if the window were taken out? Several details of the regulations need to be well and truly examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person could completely re-wire and re-plumb his house and re-tile the roof. He could be electrocuted, drown or fall off the highest point of the building, and there is no regulation to cover that, yet we have a regulation to install a new door or window in every building. Does the Minister think that we will need regulations to cover electricians, plumbers and re-tilers in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote again from the company in Kent, Davies and Tate pic. Mr. Phil Davies has been a supplier to the DIY and independent fitters and the small builders' trade for 25 years. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"surely logic dictates that this convoluted scheme has been created in such a way as to benefit financially the GGF, Pilkingtons and insurance companies and, yet again, at the expense of consumers who will, ultimately, have to pay for it whether they are having windows installed by a fitter or doing it themselves!"</p></blockquote>
This is an unwarranted regulation that goes too far, which is being introduced by the control-freak Government, with its army of window snoopers who will go around looking for new windows and doors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. Christopher Leslie)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a fine exposition—a tour de force—of all the issues surrounding window building regulations we have had from the hon. Member for Cotswold. It was extremely impressive, and it is a great honour to follow his speech. I should also like to pay tribute to my predecessor, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, who was instrumental in the formulation of much of what we are discussing today. I warmly welcome the opportunity to debate the building regulations and the important new initiative of self-certification. I shall try my best to cover the many points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want first to say a little about what self-certification, as a principle, seeks to achieve—the point raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. By allowing members of the schemes that are recognised under the regulations to self-certify their work, the Government are ensuring that we meet our Kyoto commitments to reduce carbon emissions, without imposing unbearable burdens on installers or local authorities. We are promoting competent firms, by deliberately rewarding good practice. We are reinforcing existing voluntary schemes and encouraging the creation of new ones that will ensure safe, quality workmanship and bring added customer protection. We are reducing the burden of inspection as much as possible from building control bodies, so that they can concentrate on high-risk installers and builders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is to enhance the reputation of the industry and place responsibility where it best lies—with the installer. With that in mind, we embarked on the process of introducing self-certification into the building regulations. The current schemes cover not only the replacement of windows, but the replacement of oil and solid fuel fired combustion appliances, and plumbing. All that work has health and safety implications and is controlled by the building regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has fallen straight into my point of order. Will he now say categorically which Department is responsible for the Health and Safety Executive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the transfer of functions orders are published, it is thought that health and safety matters will be transferred to the Department for Transport, although many issues are inter-related and there is great co-ordination between Government Departments as there always has been on health and safety regulations, building regulations, construction and other matters. All will be made clear, when the orders are published, as happens with any Government change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the largest and most recent scheme, the fenestration self-assessment scheme—Fensa. It allows registered window installers to self-certify that their work complies with the building regulations. The Government made replacement windows a controlled fitting as a result of changes that were made to part L of the building regulations that deal with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
conservation of fuel and power. The total package of changes will ultimately prevent 1.4 million tonnes of carbon per annum from being discharged into the atmosphere by 2010. The changes are significant and will ensure that windows are installed in an energy efficient manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It soon became clear that the 1.2 million replacement window contracts undertaken each year could result in a cost burden on the industry having to go through normal building control, and on building control itself. To overcome that, we accepted a proposal from the Glass and Glazing Federation to develop a self-certification scheme. We made it clear that any such scheme must be open to all firms that met the eligibility criteria and that the group developing it must include key stakeholders. Among others, those invited to attend the steering group were the District Surveyors Association, the House Builders Federation, consumer organisations, the Trading Standards Institute, the Law Society, glazing industry representative bodies and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, as was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate has focused on consultation and on our attempt to address the history of that process. The draft scheme rules were launched at a major event at the Aston Villa conference centre on 4 December 2001, which was attended by about 650 people. That was the largest conference in the country to have been dedicated to glazing. A video was available for those who were unable to attend, but I do not have a copy of it to hand at present. In parallel with that, we consulted at all stages—from consideration of the initial options, through to the agreeing of the contents of the final scheme—with the Building Regulations Advisory Committee, which is a statutory advisory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a short space of time, a workable fair and transparent scheme has been developed. There has been more than adequate consultation on it, which gave considerable opportunity for those not involved in the detail of its creation to be involved at a later date, and the door is still open for those who wish to contribute to the evolution of this policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The self-certification of replacement windows is helping us to meet our international environment commitments at a minimum cost, while also going some way to improve the reputation of the glazing industry. The Fensa scheme is an innovative and radical approach to complying with the building regulations in England and Wales, and it offers a model on which we can build in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fensa will operate a scheme that will be almost totally electronic. To address the point that the hon. Member for Cotswold was asking about, local authorities will be sent certificates in an electronic format, and they will be able to arrange for automatic storage on their databases without further work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has glossed over the main thrust of the debate: why were the Federation of Master Builders and other representatives of small builders not consulted? Has he not asked the Building
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Regulations Advisory Committee why it did not undertake such consultations? Is he not curious as to why builders were not asked about building?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation history is worthy of close examination, and I have been trying my best to read the runes of what went on over the past few years. I wish to emphasise three key elements of the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there was the principle of self-certification. There were two main consultations on that—the 1997 consultation document, which addressed proposals for reducing the administrative burden that also had the prospect of enhancing health and safety, and the document that we published in 1999 that took forward self-certification under the building regulations. Therefore, there was a significant consultation process with everyone concerned on the principle of self-certification—and that was open to the Federation of Master Builders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as the Committee is aware, there were significant changes to part L of the building regulations, and there was also a considerable consultation on those principles, which was published—I think—in 1998, and firmer proposals were published in April 2001. Therefore, there was a significant period during which representations could have been made on those aspects of the changes affecting windows and their low emissivity values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the point that must be stressed about Fensa is that it was never intended to be a detail of our consultation. It was set up by the Glass and Glazing Federation, which was the body that undertook the bulk of the detailed consultation about the structure that it was setting up. I have mentioned the Aston villa conference in 2001, and that was part of that process. Therefore, there was considerable consultation on all parts of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the electronic operations in the Fensa scheme. It is important that local authorities will be sent certificates in electronic form. They will then be able to search their own databases, or use the central Fensa database. The scheme has been designed to place the minimum burdens on local authorities and installers, while making the maximum use of the latest technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fensa has already registered 4,000 firms that have agreed to offer an insurance-backed guarantee and have their work inspected regularly. The majority of the glazing industry—calculated by volume—has already been covered, and we expect Fensa to go from strength to strength. We are also aware that the other schemes that have been mentioned have had considerable interest from potential members, and we look forward to a significant increase in membership over the next year. Indeed, on current growth rates, by the end of the year Fensa could have 11,000 members, making it one of the largest registration schemes in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister touches on a subject that has not yet been mentioned in the debate but which is important—Fensa's efficiency. Will the Minister give the Committee an undertaking that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and his Department and successors will continue to monitor Fensa's work and ensure that it deals with applications efficiently? What appeal mechanism will there be against its decisions? It is an overarching body, and if it starts to become unreasonable, a mechanism of appeal will be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the undertaking that the Department will keep a close watch on how things progress, especially as this is a pilot scheme in self-certification and developing the policy. The Fensa steering group will help oversee many of the nuts and bolts of the issues involved, and our mind is not closed on the operation of the scheme. If over time changes seem necessary, we shall be happy to consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an appeals mechanism, I would be worried about creating overly bureaucratic structures, but I shall consider the matter. However, as we are at such an embryonic stage, we should like to remain flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help if I discuss some of the other schemes in the building regulations and the consultation that was held. We recognised at an early stage that it was a new venture—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boris Johnson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Henley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clear up an ambiguity in my mind before he moves on to discuss the other self-certification schemes? If, as recently happened at our house, a window falls in and I replace it myself, am I obliged to seek council approval of what I have done, or sign up to Fensa?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman would not apply to become a member of Fensa if his bathroom window fell out. However, I understand that in respect of changes to part L of the building regulations, as in the case of any alteration to a home that falls under the building regulations, consultation and discussion with his local authority building control department would be wise, to ensure that the building control regulations were adhered to, just as he should consult his local authority planning department in the event of planning regulation changes. I do not want to drop him in it retrospectively, but I am sure that he has ensured that he has complied with those changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to nail that point to the floor, to mix building metaphors. Would I have to seek retrospective approval from the council for having jammed in a pane with putty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I write to the hon. Gentleman with details of the scheme to which he refers, as I have not seen his window. If he invites me to do so, I might inspect it personally. I am informed that if the window is simply to be repaired, building regulations do not apply, but in the event of a completely new reinstallation of a window, they would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Patrick Mercer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newark)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) does not change his profession and become a glazier, will the Minister comment on who will bear the cost of seeking
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
approval for fitting a new window? Will my hon. Friend have to apply in writing and pay a sum? If so, how much? Will it add to the cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is normal practice for building regulations and building control departments of local authorities throughout the country. Notices are lodged, and local authorities can charge a fee. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, as in the case of a planning department, that is part and parcel of the normal operation of local authority building control departments, and it has been so for a long time, not only during my tenure of office in the post of the past two weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Mann 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bassetlaw)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend initially offered to write in detail on that point. I appreciate that he is new to the post, but my local authority charges a £200 fee for any building amendment. I have approximately 50 windows in my property in total, including outbuildings, all of which require replacement in the immediate future. If I totalled them all up perhaps I could put in one bid. We have four building inspectors who cover all types of work in Bassetlaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification in writing of the precise implications of the regulation, and whether there will be flexibility in future statutory instruments, so that we do not end up with a quagmire of bureaucracy. If people carry on doing what they have always done and do the repairs themselves or get friends or family to do them, they would find that the work is outwith building controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend has particular issues that need clarification, I urge him to speak to the building control department of his local authority, which is best placed to advise on its fees and charges arrangements. If he has 50 windows in his property, my understanding is that he would not have to pay the building control notice fee for each one in the notification of any building changes, but for changes to the building as a whole. I hope he will not press me too much on my basic understanding of the building control procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Mann</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had a great deal of personal experience of building control and regulations, that would be the case only if I wanted to put in all windows at the same time. The maintenance of windows tends to be a recurrent issue, which would therefore involve payment of £200 every time a window required replacement. I repeat that I seek written assurance that we would not face such a consequence, because I am sure that that is not the Government's intention with this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless my hon. Friend was himself installing 50 brand new windows on separate occasions, I doubt that he would face the charges concerned. As I said, my understanding is that building control notice requirements relate to the whole of the work concerned. If a registered member of Fensa was undertaking the work, the charge for self-certification would probably be approximately £1 per window if the notification was done electronically, or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
£3 if sent by fax to the Fensa system. Some building control bodies have introduced special rates for replacement window works of about £60 a quarter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make progress, because we are short of time, but I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson), because, under present circumstances, if his window was rotten and fell out, he would go off to B&Q, buy a new one and put it in, which would be half a day's work. Now, he will have to get building regulation approval from the local authority. [
	<i>Interruption</i>.] That is what the regulation says. Either one is a member of Fensa, or one must obtain building regulation approval. If he has to apply for building regulation, local authorities will charge a minimum of £100. Furthermore, he presumably could not install the window until the local authority has given him approval. He will be sitting in his house getting very cold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have many other points to cover, and will try not to dwell on that one. If the hon. Member for Henley personally wants not only to repair or maintain the glazing but to remove the frame, he should consult his local authority's building control department, which will have its own fees and charges. That has been a function of the changes to part L of the building regulations with regard to greater energy efficiency standards, which I am sure that everyone agrees are necessary and important. If he chose to go to the majority of the window companies throughout the country to do the installation, a negligible fee— probably about £1—would be involved. Repairs such as putting glass back in with putty do not usually come under the building control notice procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many points have been raised and I shall cover them as best I can. I had intended to discuss the other three bodies that are mentioned in the regulations: the heating equipment and testing approvals scheme for the installation of solid fuel heating producing appliances; the Oil Firing Technical Association for the Petroleum Industry; and the Institute of Plumbing. All those organisations are non-profit making, as is Fensa. Their operations are transparent and they are open to all firms that meet the relevant criteria. They are designed for the general good and are highly regarded. The installation of heating appliances and associated fittings and plumbing can create serious hazards if not properly undertaken, so that is controlled by the building regulations. Specialists usually undertake the work—maybe the hon. Member for Henley is a specialist in such areas; I am not entirely familiar with the areas in which he is a specialist. It is vital that the people who undertake such work have the necessary training and experience and several voluntary schemes exist to ensure that firms have those provisions in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
There is consensus throughout the country that there must be an increase in training competence and consumer protection throughout the construction industry at large. We are only too aware of the skill shortages that are prevalent in many parts of the industry. We are also well aware of the poor standards of workmanship that are sometimes faced by customers. The consequences of that are sadly, but rarely, life-threatening. Self-certification is a major step towards reducing regulatory burdens while promoting competence and confidence in key industry sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall touch on points raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold about the regulatory impact assessment. I understand that that was freely available from the Department, which is the normal practice. I shall place the document in the Library if the hon. Gentleman could not obtain it from the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked whether the Government are willing to listen to, and enter into dialogue with, firms about Fensa's operation. Certainly, we are. The operation is a pilot scheme in self-certification. We are happy to examine and discuss detailed operational matters. I shall be happy to discuss the matter with Federation of Master Builders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about registration for multiple self-certification schemes. Fensa is a pilot self-certification scheme and I am more than happy to learn lessons from such schemes. We must ensure competence in each trade at the registration stage, but I am happy to explore some form of consolidation, if that is required and possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold asked many other questions. He said that some firms are not content with the changes to part L and the low-emissivity changes. I have discussed the importance of our commitment to the Kyoto protocol. Twenty-eight per cent. of a home's heat is lost through its windows, so we are taking a significant step to contribute to our commitments. The hon. Gentleman told us of an anecdotal case, but we have not seen evidence of sales decreasing in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was raised about costs to local authority building control departments. I understand that building control departments will make significant savings. Local authorities will be able to access the Fensa database, although they will not police Fensa because that will be a job for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Fensa steering group. Local authority representatives were involved in the establishment of Fensa at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for some of the insurance matters to which the hon. Gentleman referred, it is a requirement that an insurance Act guarantee is offered. It is for the client to decide whether he takes up the offer. Apparently, at the previous Fensa board, it was decided to take a closer look at developing a model insurance background and that will be done in consultation with interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold also referred to creating a monopoly for glass suppliers and mentioned Pilkington. While Pilkington is in a strong market
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
position, there are competitors. We understand that Saint-Gobain is competing with Pilkington to meet the new demand for low-emissivity glass and that the Belgium firm, Glaverbel, is likely to be entering the market, too. Pilkington's price rise affected all types of glass, not just low-E glass, and Saint Gobain is competing. We have also heard that Glaverbel has built a production line to serve the United Kingdom market. A United States firm has recently announced plans to build a glass plant in the north-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed whether the kite mark scheme would have been a better alternative. Alone, that could have been open to abuse. It is not the nature of the glass with which we are concerned—a point made by the hon. Member for Henley—but how the glass is installed. If there were high-quality glass but poor installation, the value of the energy efficiency level would not be in accordance with part L of the buildings regulations. The installation process matters significantly, which is why we focused on the installers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From June 2000, there has been significant consultation during the publicity process on part L. We have tried our best to help Fensa develop a website to communicate with all concerned. Listed buildings are an important consideration. Website guidance by English Heritage is now available and paper copies of it will soon be published. The hon. Member for Cotswold asked about other building regulations that are not subject to statutory instrument discussions. Electrical safety is of importance to me and I shall closely examine that. All in all, self-certification is an exciting development in reducing the burdens affecting industry. Many worries have been caused by confusion and misunderstandings about the operation of the scheme. It is designed to reduce burdens significantly and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Patrick Mercer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the Minister's responsibilities seem opaque but, as far as windows are concerned, they are thoroughly transparent. Sorry, I had to say that. I do not wish to frame the hon. Gentleman any further. I noticed the glum look on the face of the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) when he said that windows were likely to impose further costs on him. I will have a word with your predecessor, Mr. O'Brien. He thinks that that will be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw the Minister away from reading the runes of the building industry to the building yards in north-east Nottinghamshire. My constituency used to depend on two things: agriculture and manufacturing. Both industries are in terrible decline. Perhaps that
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
was why the Labour Member of Parliament for my constituency was so convincingly seen off at the previous election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So many manufacturing firms and farmers in my constituency are now having to diversify. A most notable example called Robert Sutton is probably known to the hon. Member for Bassetlaw. He has diversified in a big way. He is converting farm building and other types of buildings, and trying to make a little profit as his farming declines. His builder, who is working on a building close to me, is John Ford. I took the liberty last night of speaking to him at some length. Mr. Ford does everything; he is a master Jack-of-all-trades, if that is not a contradiction in terms. He is fitting windows to an old building, and has to fit each one individually. He is also fitting a Klargester, which is something that mulches sewage. It comes with pipes and all sorts of things that I do not understand. He puts all them in by himself. He is putting a new roof on, and is fitting a new heating system to what will be a fine building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I talk to him about how self-regulation and self-certification will affect him, his response is simple. He regards himself as a craftsman, and does all those jobs very adequately. He knows that in every one of those disciplines—namely heating, windows, drainage and plumbing—either he or the man employing him, Mr. Sutton, will be required to pay further sums. That will add to his costs as a small builder, and, indeed, to those of the farmer, who is desperately trying to diversify into some other business. "I simply don't understand," was Mr. Ford's phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to underline the point so ably made first by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and secondly by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold. Mr. John Ford's biggest worry is that the regulations will drive trade out of the hands of craftsmen like himself, and into those of cowboy builders. He is not a politician; he has no axe to grind. He is a simple horny-handed son of toil, a builder, a man trying to earn a living. He realises that money is being taken out of his pocket and that of the farmer who employs him. He sees no way out from the fact that the cowboy will prosper at the expense of the tradesman, the artisan and the small business man endeavouring to scrape a living in difficult circumstances in north-east Nottinghamshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interfire is a new firm in Newark that was set up by a man who worked for a ball-bearing manufacturer in Newark and was made redundant and a farm worker who had also been made redundant. Those two gentlemen mostly fit wood-burning stoves. I telephoned them this morning to talk about the regulations involving the heating equipment testing and approval scheme and the Oil Firing Technical Association for the Petroleum Industry. I said to them, "What's this all about? How is it going to affect you?" The answer was, "We simply don't know. It's complicated and ambiguous, and all we know is that it is going to cost us money." They said that the Confederation of Registered Gas Installers, or CORGI—the scheme, not the dog—was just fine. There was a huge degree of confusion.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
I mention that in order to make the point that the regulations are not understood. I pray and beg that the regulations are properly advertised and understood by small business men upon whom constituencies such as mine depend. In summary, the regulations are not understood, and will cost both the local authority and small business men dear. I simply do not understand where the benefits of the scheme lie. I foresee many problems, but nothing that will help and support my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Mann</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stumbled inadvertently into the debate, having seen the statutory instrument. There is a building boom in north Nottinghamshire; most of it seems to be on my property at the moment. The craftsmen are mostly from the constituency of the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bane of my life is the tendency towards modern building methods and building inspectors. That tendency is so great that a 200-year-old building, which has stood perfectly adequately for all that time, according to building inspectors now requires a steel and concrete reinforced strut to ensure that it does not fall in. It is not falling in, and it has not fallen in, but that requirement is the result of various calculations that are made to meet modern building methods, which are highly inefficient and of significantly poorer quality. I can emphasise that by pointing out that it is the installation of UPVC windows—and, before them, of PVC windows—rather than the quality of the windows themselves that is always the problem, as are gaps between frame and brick that allow the draft to get in, but building inspectors will not be checking that at any stage in the future. I have a window that was blacked-out 150 years ago, and I presume that if I were to black-out another window and replace it, that would avoid these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two concerns, the first of which is about roof lights. It is welcome and encouraging that people in this country are converting attics, lofts and outbuildings, to create more accommodation: the density of population, and the desire of people for more living space, make that a fundamental development. For people who live in a small terraced house—of which there are many in my constituency—the creation of extra living space through the use of roof lights and conversions is an important opportunity. I seek an assurance from the Minister— whom I do not envy for having taken over this portfolio—that this matter will be looked at, so that we can ensure that nothing will be done to reduce the number of conversions and the willingness of people to convert what is, in effect, dead space in their property to increase its living space, because the alternative to that is simply to build—and to build more on what would otherwise be green space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a point that involves a constituent and close neighbour of mine, Mr. Lee Fulcher. He was the union convener at West Burton power station for 25 years, but he is now retired. In his free time he makes windows—a small number of them, and only on order to local people. He estimates that the costs of
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
registration mean that it will not be worth his while to maintain that business. Many craftsmen are entering retirement, and this country should wish to maintain their skills. Indeed, I hope that, as a part of the ongoing pensions programme, we will be encouraging them to do small amounts of craft-based work, so that they can generate more income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister might visit my constituency? We hold a Labour party garden party at the end of July at my property, to which Mr. Fulcher is invited, as he is a good supporter of the party. If the Minister were to accept the invitation, he would have an opportunity to look at what this legislation is about at first hand, because every aspect of these regulations relates to building works on my property, from the solid fuel to the oil installations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask for two commitments from the Minister that have not been asked for, and which do not appear to have been part of the consultation—which I was glad to hear began in 1997, because that means that its genesis pre-dates the election of this Labour Government, which should be put on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the Minister to consult further with the solar energy industry, because building regulations do not allow various forms of solar energy to be used. There is a lack of logic in the current situation, with regard to some of the restrictions that are put on the solar energy industry in its use of what would be the equivalent of roof lights. That must be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish the Minister to consult with the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings. That organisation is made up of crafts people, and therefore it is an even more expert body than English Heritage with regard to the impact of these regulations—and other potential regulations. They come from the big business-led building regulations world, which needs to be addressed in a much wider debate and considered at greater length in the future. I hope that the Minister will give a commitment that, at some stage, we will have a full debate on building methods and the loss of craft skills in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all looking forward to visiting the hon. Gentleman's stately home when he has finished fitting it out. Does he think that any aspect of these regulation as they relate to windows will be a good thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>John Mann</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a stately home, but a small, modest farm. As it is in north Nottinghamshire, I swapped it for a three-bedroom terrace in Hertfordshire, having been elected as a Member of Parliament, and I got £20,000 change, which shows the wisdom of living in the north of England. The accommodation in Bassetlaw represents by far the best value for money in any price range than that anywhere else in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that the regulations are appropriate in relation to solid fuel and oil systems. The kind of arbitrary, made-at-home oil and solid systems that I have seen—I have just had one removed from my property—are not in keeping with current knowledge on health and safety. It is sensible to have coherent regulations that are thought through and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
result from proper consultation, so I ask the Minister to give a commitment to consult further the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and the solar energy industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.51am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as I can. This is a very important debate, and the more that I have listened to it, the clearer it has become. This is one of those occasions when we are impinging directly on people's livelihoods in the building trades. I admire very much what my hon. Friends have said, as well as some of what Labour Members said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newark, I want to draw on my own personal experience very briefly. We had a cowboy builder—a man who had suffered a very brutal and deceptive hair transplant operation, but the iron had entered his soul and he decided to swindle us in return. I tried to chase him down for some money. When I finally tracked him down at his father's address in Tunbridge Wells, he said that his son was on a long fact-finding mission to Canada, where he has been ever since, as far as I know. I wonder what, if anything, this measure will do to protect people such as me and my wife from cowboy builders such as him. Of course the answer is that it will do absolutely nothing, but it is presented as a measure not to protect the consumer, but to stop the emission of greenhouse gases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we accept the greenhouse science, the Minister's extraordinary claim that these regulations will prevent 1.4 million tonnes of carbon from entering the atmosphere is extremely unlikely simply because they will not lead to the installation of fewer leaky windows. That follows a strong belief that this measure is not actuated by any desire to fulfil our obligations under the Kyoto protocol. I am afraid to say that it is a stitch up, as the Minister should know, between the Government and the Glass and Glaziers Federation, which will administer a lucrative and onerous scheme to its own advantage, as has been suggested. Of course those suspicions are fuelled by the fact that, as has been said repeatedly, the Government so signally failed to consult the Federation of Master Builders, all 13,000 of whose members are directly involved, or the Federation of Small Businesses. That seems extremely eccentric if the Government wish to introduce such regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nub of the matter is that, if people want to replace their windows, they have to seek council approval, which costs £100, or join Fensa, which costs £370. Will such a measure deter cowboys? Self-evidently, it will not because the consumer will not have the faintest idea whether the person who installs his windows is a member of Fensa, Mensa or anything else. Good firms will be unnecessarily burdened. Struggling firms, such as those that hon. Members have described so eloquently, will be penalised and risk going under. People who are so rash as to try to install
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
windows themselves will be in the absurd position of having to go the council to ask permission, prospectively or retrospectively, and to pay for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the 4,623rd regulation that has been introduced by the Government in the past year alone. It is nothing short of a window tax. It is the first time since the age of William and Mary that such a tax has been imposed on the British people. It is a great error and it should be defenestrated forthwith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.55 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extremely interesting and illuminating debate. My only observation when listening to the hon. Member for Bassetlaw was that, at least in this corner of the Room, we feel a degree of poverty in our fenestration. We are clearly window-poor compared with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has come out of the debate is worry about the content of the regulations. That is not the substance of the regulations that we are discussing, nevertheless it is a relevant consideration. Great concern is felt about the way in which they will operate. There is specific anxiety about the lack of consultation. It was interesting that the Minister was clearly briefed to talk about absolutely anything else other than consultation with the builders. He kept returning to the three elements within the regulations. We all said that we were not interesting in discussing them because we were content with them, but his brief clearly suggested that that was safe ground and that he should stay on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for reiterating the Government's position that they are willing to meet the Federation of Master Builders. That is useful, and I hope that it will happen in the near future, so that the federation's views can be expressed. I am also grateful to him for saying that he will consider the possibility of consolidating the self-regulation schemes to reduce costs to the people working in the industry and to the consumers. That is a sensible approach. However, throughout his comments he was loathe to say anything about the glaring omission that is at the heart of the prayer that we tabled and at the heart of so many comments that have been made today—the fact that we have building regulations and a means of administering them that has not taken account of the views of the builders. That is the key consideration. The fact that the Minister was not willing to apologise for the lack of consultation, which is patent within the history of the exercise, or to say that there was a way in which to improve future consultation procedure, suggests that it is proper for us to press the matter to a Division, and I suggest that that happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.58 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the two-and-a-half minutes that remain, I shall try to deal with some of the points that have been raised. I thought that I had sufficiently addressed the consultation aspect, especially with regard to part L and the principle of self-certification, and that undertaken by Fensa, so I shall respond to the hon. Members for Newark and for Henley about building control and building regulations in general. I understand what was meant by farmers diversifying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
and so on, but converting buildings has been covered by not only planning regulations, but building regulations. That has been so for probably longer than I have been alive, so there is nothing new there. I accept what was said about publicity, consultation and understanding of the regulations and I shall reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to cowboy builders and the point raised by the hon. Member for Henley who, unfortunately, slurred the Glass and Glazing Federation. I hope that not too many members of the federation will be queueing up at his surgery, but that is a matter for him. The new regulations will help to reduce the number of cowboy builders and encourage competent firms that need to be identified to be registered. They will also reduce the burden of inspections on local authorities, so that they can focus their resources on rooting out such builders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw said about conversions, but building regulations must ensure safety and competence when changes are being undertaken. I am happy to meet the Federation of Master Builders. I accept what my hon. Friend said about the solar energy industry and I shall continue dialogue with it, especially about
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
photovoltaic technology. I shall also continue consulting the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which deals with matters that are close to my heart. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
