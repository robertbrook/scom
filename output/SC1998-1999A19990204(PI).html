	<p>[MR. JOE BENTON 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Greater London Authority Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>(Except clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and schedules 1 and 2)</p>

	<p>2.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Benton, I welcome you to the Chair. I have three points to make, which I hope to wrap up into a job lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be appropriate for the Business Sub-Committee to discuss whether the Committee will meet during the half-term break. I should also like information about the budget. I am becoming increasingly concerned that the first mile post providing for eight sittings in which to discuss 120 clauses is then followed by the next mile post, which covers 80 clauses in nine sittings. The mile posts seem to be disproportionately phased. I cannot complain as I am a member of the Business Sub-Committee, but I missed that point at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our previous sitting, the Minister for Transport in London said that she would be amending the culture clauses, which she described as skeletal. We welcome that, but it may be appropriate if the hon. Lady tables the amendments, which I imagine will be substantial, earlier rather than later so that we have adequate time to digest their contents, instead of having just a few days in which to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have you received representations, Mr. Benton, from Ministers about whether they wish to make a statement about the amendments that we tabled during the Committee sitting of the whole House about the 5 per cent. threshold to the assembly? At the time, we were asked to withdraw them, and the Minister undertook to consider the points that we had made. In the circumstances, I am sure that you and members of the Committee were most surprised to read in the national press today that a decision has been made about the matter. Not only will the Conservative view be rejected, but the discretion to have something less than a 5 per cent. threshold seems to have been abandoned. It will be a fixed 5 per cent. threshold. Would not it be more appropriate if the Committee, not the media, was informed of such decisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. I, too, wish to preface my remarks by welcoming you to the Chair. The number of Chairmen is nearly as great as the number of members of the Committee. Nevertheless, you are welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
It would be helpful if the Minister could make a statement about the threshold, a point that was raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway). My clear understanding was that no further announcement will be made by the Government until after consultation with the Conservative party, the Liberal Democrats and other parties that might have an interest in the matter. The press does not state that the Government have made a decision, but suggests that they have reached a view. The Government need to distance themselves from such reports and refute them if the Minister's understanding, for which we were grateful, is to be honoured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Benton. I add my voice to those that have already evinced a welcome to you, Mr. Benton. As for the points made by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) about a threshold, the Government have made no further statement. They stand by the commitment that they gave on the Floor of the House. They are not responsible for press speculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The press was briefed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Croydon, South says that the press was briefed. I have no knowledge of that, and the Government stand by what was said on the Floor of the House of Commons on this particularly important and sensitive matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about the amendments that we intend to table on the cultural aspects of the mayor's strategy. Yes; as far as is humanly possible, we shall of course attempt to furnish the Committee with those amendments in good time, so that hon. Members can scrutinise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the Committee's sittings, as the hon. gentleman said, the matter was agreed by the business managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister tor that reply. It saved me having to be absolutely negative with my first ruling. I was about to say that the matters that have been raised are not matters for the Chair. However, I hope that they have been clarified to the satisfaction of the hon. Member for Croydon, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had a response to my question on the budget, and whether or not we shall be sitting while the House of Commons is having its half-term break.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should make a little progress. It would be more appropriate if that question were directed through the usual channels. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 33</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>GENERAL DUTIES OF THE MAYOR IN RELATION TO HIS STRATEGIES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 69 in page 19, leave out lines 2 to 18 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(A)(1) The Mayor may prepare and publish any strategies or revisions to existing strategies that he considers necessary to further the purpose mentioned in section 25(1) above.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) The strategies or any revisions to strategies mentioned in subsection (1) above shall only take effect with the majority support of the Assembly"</p></blockquote>
The amendment is the first of a series of amendments to clause 33 and the part of the Bill that is entitled, "The Mayor's strategies". It sounds rather like the title of a medieval play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall indeed get on with it, to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a probing amendment that is designed to discover why the Government have suggested that the mayor should be responsible for the strategies listed in clause 33—transport, the London development agency, biodiversity, municipal waste, air quality, ambient noise and culture—but no other strategy or combination of strategies. It seems an almost random selection. The only strategy that is obligatory on the mayor or the authority is the London development strategy, which is required under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government wish to impose strategies on the mayor, my hon. Friends and I suggest at least four more. For example, we could include a strategy for health promotion. We shall come, in the next amendment, to a strategy for sustainable development. Doubtless there will be a strategy for wealth creation—the Government so clearly now believe in that; it is the new socialist mantra. There could also be a strategy for environmental improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative, which we would prefer, is the procedure suggested in the amendment. We do not want a list of strategies, because the mayor, the assembly and the authority should be able to decide for themselves what they want to do. This will be a recurring theme during our debates. The Bill is either telling the GLA, the mayor or the assembly what to do and how to do it; or it is saying, "We shall not tell you now; the Secretary of State will tell you later." Neither is consistent with regional government having proper authority, status or self-management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Government are now resiled from it being regional government and are calling it city-wide government, the government of our capital city should, as far as possible, be free to decide what it wants to do. We may argue that it should be required to do certain things, but the list that the mayor has to follow is, to cite a phrase used yesterday in the House of Commons by the leader of the Conservative party, a list of things into which the Government are meddling unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
All these matters could properly be decided upon after the election of the mayor and the assembly next May. It is inconceivable that the mayor and the assembly will not come up with a transport strategy because they will have to run transport for London. It is inconceivable that they will not work out a strategy for municipal waste, because they must run the service, or that they will not have an air-quality strategy. Stating that the authority needs a culture strategy seems extremely municipalist and centralist. Stating that it needs strategies for specific matters, such as ambient noise, seems superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our preference is to remove those strategies from the Bill, leaving the authority to decide what it wants to do. However, there should be an overarching strategy for the sustainable development of the city, and we shall argue for that in the next debate. If, at first blush, the Government resist the amendment—it is just conceivable that they will retain the strategies—amendment No. 314 would at least put them in the context of sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled amendment No. 314 as a fall back in the event that we are unable to persuade the Committee of the merit of amendment No. 69. We hope that Labour and Conservative Members will agree that it is not for the House of Commons to tell the mayor what strategies to have. The mayor should decide on his or her priorities within the overall powers given to the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the previous sitting, my hon. Friends questioned the Government on whether the authority should have a responsibility to engage with the business community, the voluntary sector and so on. Ministers were helpful and said that they thought that a good idea and that the Government would return with some proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government understand the difference between establishing the mechanisms by which the authority will operate and defining its powers and what should be done by individual players within it. That is why we think it proper that the Bill should not state in detail how the authority should consult the business community or the voluntary sector but simply establish that they should be partners in consultation. We think it inappropriate to list six particular strategies and not others; it will be perfectly possible for the authority to sort out such matters itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth (Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has said. It is utter nonsense to think that sprinkling such words across the Bill will be beneficial. Simply repeatedly using the word "strategy" will not make anyone's life better. In fact, the obligation that the Bill will lay on elected and accountable people to produce numerous strategies is danger of being counterproductive. Simply including those words will not deliver the results—arguably, it might to the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was that the clause is yet another example of the Bill running directly counter to what Minister have been at pains to tell the Committee from the start. We are led to believe that this will be a new thrusting, dynamic, exciting and radical authority, elected by and accountable to the people of London. However, the people elected will be hidebound by Ministers' diktats because of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
Candidates for mayor will be unable to produce their own ideas, present them to the electorate and ask for their support. It is at least possible that candidates might say, "We want a strategy-free London." People would be happier and more relaxed as a result; they might even pay fewer taxes, too. That is a perfectly reasonable option to offer the people of London, not this prescriptive nonsense under which Londoners will be killed with strategies and taxes to death. We need a serious, mature, adult—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Poplar and Canning Town)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman's strategy-free London mean that groups such as cyclists, which traditionally have not been consulted on transport strategies, would continue to be ignored by whoever ran London, to their detriment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, but perhaps not, because the hon. Gentleman could stand as the "I will listen to everything that cyclists say" candidate, and I could stand as the "I don't give a damn about cyclists" candidate, and we could see who received more support. I always thought that that was the point of elections and democracy. I am happy for candidates to stand, to be elected and to be judged on that basis, but the Bill as drafted tries to preclude most of that process, which I thought was the proper process of democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that we had a written constitution that was designed to circumscribe what different political parties could offer the electorate and what the Government of the day could do, or that said that no political party will lay a finger on the House of Lords in any circumstances. Labour Members would be the first to say that that would be outrageous, and that it would place an artificial constraint on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>2.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman propose no restriction on the activities of the mayor and the assembly in London? Is he suggesting that the mayor might raise a standing army, or might make provisions for London to have its own nuclear deterrent, for example? Will he clarify exactly what he is saying? I am not clear whether he believes that any constraints or parameters should exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting proposition; perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I could put our heads together to see whether we could come up with some such thoughts. However, that is not what we are debating. We are not debating what the authority will not be able to do. Instead, an attempt is being made by Ministers and, presumably, the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes), to say in advance what elected, accountable people will offer and try to deliver to the people of London. That is the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested in propositions about standing armies for London, or even for an independent London nuclear deterrent; perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I could put our thoughts together on that. However, that is not what we are debating. We are debating the apparent dichotomy and incompatibility between, on the one hand, the avowed aims of Ministers to create a new, accountable
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
authority, and, on the other, what their Bill says, which is that the authority will not and cannot be accountable because its activities will be circumscribed from the start. I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome to the Committee, Mr. Benton; I hope that you enjoy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have important business to do, so I shall not dwell too long on the amendment, which, according to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, is merely probing. However, the more we probe, and the deeper we delve, the more we recognise the fully prescriptive nature of Her Majesty's Government's attitude to the authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McNulty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to what the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) have said, how is clause 33 prescriptive? How does it circumscribe which strategies the Greater London authority may pursue? It does not. It is a de minimis provision, not the be-all and end-all of which strategies the GLA may provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Benton, will rule me out of order if I refer to that part of the hon. Gentleman's intervention that referred to the admirable speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. Nor will I rise to the Latin tag that has been prescribed down the other end of the Corridor. I believe that I understand what de minimis means. However, we are dealing with a maximist approach: a list of specific strategies are required of the mayoralty, which is unusual in such legislation. Normally, powers are spelt out, as in clause 25, and the Greater London authority would be allowed to get on with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, that is not my main anxiety, which is the overriding emphasis on the mayor alone. As I said in our previous sitting, we must not create an autocratic government for London. We want an authority in which the mayor works with the assembly and that should be spelt out, so that the appropriate strategies can be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)—which, with the rest of the clause, the Liberal Democrats would omit—is fascinating. Our legislature has traditionally regarded something that is "under review" as a formula for inaction, not action. When it is kept permanently under review, we know that nothing will ever get done. Subsection (2) is therefore fundamentally in conflict with subsection (1). It makes no reference to the assembly having influence on the modification of strategies, but it is surely desirable for the assembly to have the power to scrutinise, give advice and influence things for the better. As have so many other clauses, the clause betrays the Government's outlook towards the institution that they are creating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the assembly will not be consulted in regard to strategies, but clause 34 expressly sets out that it will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not dealing with clause 34 and were I to stray into it, Mr. Benton, you would rightly bring me rapidly to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
I was dealing with the wording that the Liberal Democrats wish to replace with their amendment. The part of the clause that it would be especially apposite to remove is subsection (2), which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Mayor shall keep each of the strategies mentioned in subsection (1) above under review and shall make such revisions of those strategies he"—</p></blockquote>
rather tan the authority or the mayor upon the advice of the assembly—"considers necessary."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats have therefore produced more than just a probing amendment. In their digging and delving, they have revealed a can of worms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has to be one of the most interesting exchanges that we have had in our Committee. The amendment's proposal that the mayor should be able to prepare any strategy to further the authority's general purposes is unnecessary because the mayor will be able to do that under clause 27, which makes it clear that the mayor will have the power to do anything that he or she judges would further the authority's general purpose. I do not recall the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey dealing with the second part of this amendment, that such a decision by the mayor would require the agreement of the assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two parts of the amendment therefore have the objective that has been central to most of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats: to overturn the proposed balance of power within the GLA, as the Government have presented that to the people of London through a Green Paper and a White Paper. That balance of power—for the mayor to have the executive power and the assembly to have the power of scrutiny—has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of London. The amendment, in common with other Liberal Democrat amendments, demonstrates their overwhelming lack of trust—and respect—for the people of London. Their amendments are designed to undermine the power of the electorate and the overwhelming endorsement of the GLA by the people of London. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey received resounding support from the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood for his amendment. It was not unexpected that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst would present his traditional approach to government inasmuch as he is utterly opposed to any form of planning. The fact that he used the euphemism "strategy" in this context shows his antipathy to government, which is on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood clearly agrees with the Liberal Democrat perspective on the Bill. He spoke of the word "review" being exclusively to do with achieving nothing—I am probably paraphrasing—and said that it was a recipe for inaction. The purpose of reviewing strategies is entirely correct for the new, innovative, thrusting, model-form of city-wide government that the Bill will introduce to the people of London. In effect, the whole purpose of the mayor, the assembly and the integrated strategies listed in the Bill are to solve London-wide problems. Of course there should be a requirement to review the effectiveness of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
strategies, although it is our perception and belief that they will be effective. There is little point in pursuing a line of activity when the desired outcome has been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke of the freedom of the mayor and the assembly to decide from a blank sheet the important issues and strategies for this capital city. He was at pains to point out that his view of what constitutes this capital city could be restricted to about six boroughs, comprising inner London. Therefore, if he had his way, not only would he dispense with the idea intrinsically behind the strategies referred to in the Bill, which are essentially about problem solving on a pan-London basis, but he would restrict any sort of government to a minority of the people of London.

In the light of the arguments that we have heard, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am likely to disappoint the Minister. I did not elaborate, but she is right about it being the old debate that we have been having in the Committee so far.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says supportively that it is the right view. If the mayor is to have strategies or revisions to strategies—it strikes me as incomprehensible why it is necessary to legislate for someone to revise strategies—it should be done only
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the majority support of the Assembly."</p></blockquote>
I am arguing for that not because I have an obsession that the assembly must be engaged in everything, but because there is likely to be a better result. We are far more likely to get a better result by applying 26 brains rather than one. Surely, the pooled wisdom of the 26 people elected to govern London will produce a better strategy than one which comes from only one person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right that we have argued in different ways in different clauses, but the assembly should have to approve anything that the mayor proposes. Even if we accept the Government's proposition that it is an authority in which the mayor will propose, we believe that the assembly should dispose. In this clause, the mayor will propose, but there is no guarantee that the assembly—the wider body—will dispose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify the point, which we may not come back to again in the same way. The Minister said that the amendment would undermine the role of the authority and the voice of the people of London, but it would not. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
would undermine the huge concentration of power in the mayor, not the power of the 25 people—14 of them, in the Government's plan—who will come from the 14 areas of London. It would give more power to the person who represents Southwark and Lambeth—one of the seats across the river—and to those who represent the combination of boroughs in Surrey, Kent, Hertfordshire and Middlesex. The amendment would give them more, not less power. We are about sharing, not concentrating power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"to promote a system of elected government in England which responds to the needs of local communities".</p></blockquote>

Friend, and he has found a helpful supporting argument, which appears to be consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment on two other issues that the Minister raised. One relates to the debate that she sought to fire up about my view of London. We are legislating for the whole of Greater London. I took a subjective view of what constituted the real, core London. She and her hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction are Members of Parliament for the core London. She should talk to the constituents of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood or to those of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. When I was little, I stayed with my half-brothers in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton. We used to go "up to London" from Kingston and New Maiden; my half-brothers did not think of themselves as living in London. Whey my brothers played for Maiden Wanderers cricket club, they did not think of it as a London cricket club, but very much as a Surrey cricket club. There is not a common feeling about what London is; it varies.

We are arguing our case because clause 25, as was said, sets out the authority's purpose. Clause 25 and subsequent clauses set out the authority's power. From clause 67
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
onwards, we will debate the individual powers at great length—in terms of the number of clauses. Those powers are set out. There is a whole part—clauses and clauses—on finance, there is one on transport, and there is a short part on the London development agency. Thee are parts on the Metropolitan police, fire and emergency planning, planning, environmental functions and culture, media and sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I understand that connection, it is obvious that it is there. Clause 33 refers to "the transport strategy" and to section 123.

The strategies are qualified and are the only ones to which subsection (3) is attached. They are plucked out of the Bill. The mayor may want to adopt other strategies, which do not contain those considerations. I do not know why the Government should view the strategies as chosen solely to comply with specific qualifications as set out in subsection (3), to which we shall come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a final point, which the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made as well as I did. It is extraordinary to legislate for somebody to keep under review strategies and to revise them as he or she considers necessary. I suggest to Ministers that it is civil service gone mad. Do we live in a nursery age, in which central Government have to tell what they now call local or city-wide government: "Not only must you have these strategies; not only must you have these strategies for these purposes; not only must you have these strategies for these purposes with these conditions, but you must revise them, and if you revise them you must alter them"?

We believe that London government should be able to do its own thing. We also believe that the Committee should take opportunities to change the Bill so as to take away its reigns, shackles, restraints, restrictions and impositions. If the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment only briefly, to reiterate comments that I have already made. Their importance was highlighted by the reaction of the Minister for Transport in London. All too often when she seeks to clarify she obfuscates. On this occasion, however, she provided a clear picture of the attitude of Her Majesty's Government. They believe that a lord high munificence should be established, a municipal potentate so omniscient and so capable that he or she alone will have total power to pursue whatever policy he or she thinks fit. Yet the Bill contains an extraordinary contradiction. That person can do as he or she thinks fit only so far as it is prescribed in law down to the tiniest dot, comma or semi-colon of a strategic policy that will be laid down and then reviewed and revised in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats' formulation, as proposed in the amendment, is much more sensible. We should, in all conscience, trust the authority with what the electors believe it to be capable of doing—getting on and governing London in accordance with the objectives set out in clause 25 and subsequent clauses, which provide the necessary powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
The qualification that the Liberal Democrats have set out in paragraph (2) of the amendment is important. If any strategy is to work, it must have the clear majority support of the assembly. The assembly men will be in touch with their constituents—at least, 11 of them will be; the 14 others will have no such inhibitions on their freedom of action. However, as a body they will be responsible to their electors—one hopes on a regular basis—or to their party, in the case of the list members. They will be subject to influence, to pressure and to advice, which ought to be translated by the mayor into strategies that have the majority approval of the electors—and, of course, of the assembly, as the amendment states. Otherwise, the Bill will be a recipe for stasis, complete deadlock,—conflict and—an inability to keep the strategies on the road. It may be a recipe for constant review, but it is not a recipe for getting things done or implementing the strategies set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the amendment began as a probing amendment, but, my goodness, it has revealed some sinister centralist tendencies on the Government's part which ought to be condemned, and which the electorate ought to understand before they cast their votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood for complimenting me on having clarified my argument for him; I regret that I cannot return that compliment. I found it absolutely impossible to follow his argument about what constitutes strategies, who should have the power to implement them and who should decide whether they have worked or not, even before they have been implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer briefly to the remarks of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who appears to regard quantity as the decider. We have always argued that we are setting up a GLA of great quality. the hon. Gentleman's argument is that in any decision-making process, 26 brains are better than one. As my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction said from a sedentary position, not if the one is Einstein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it somewhat bemusing that the hon. Gentleman is taking such pains to examine the powers that need to revert to the GLA for the mayor to be able to introduce the relevant strategies, which will be part of the pan-London delivery of all the improvements inherent in the Bill. If I understood him correctly, his idea of ideal government for London is for mayoral candidates and assembly candidates to campaign with no powers. I believe that he would still like a very restricted London—real London, as he calls it. It would not be necessary for candidates to detail what they envisioned for London. There would be no clear balance of powers—but why would that be needed, because candidates would not be asked to define in detail what they wanted to achieve?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it absolutely bewildering that a member of the Liberal Democratic party, which has argued on the Floor of the House and outside that there should be continuous review, culminating in defined targets, of virtually every aspect of national Government, should now turn his back on a policy review that the GLA is to implement specifically to produce for the electorate clear unarguable evidence of whether those policies are succeeding or failing.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 314, in page 19, leave out line 2 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) As soon as reasonably practicable, the Mayor shall prepare and publish a strategy to be known as the "Sustainable Development Strategy for London'.

	<li>The strategy under subsection (1) above shall integrate and inform the strategies set out in subsection (3) below.</li>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this a filibuster?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is just a series of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 314 is about sustainability. Whether or not hon. Members, think it was necessary to set out in clause 1 strategies that are, as the Minister rightly said, to be found elsewhere in the Bill, the amendment would add something that is not found anywhere else in the Bill: a sustainability strategy. That is necessary because everything should work under the umbrella aim of producing a sustainable capital city. The amendment would include in the Bill the one thing—a requirement for sustainability—about which the Minister cannot say, "It's already in the Bill; look at clause 123 or 243."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sustainability is a logical idea that is widely supported outside the House. It is logical because it is the only way that some of us can see of integrating and co-ordinating all the strategies in the context of an environmentally sustainable city. Furthermore, it is supported strongly by what is now called the sustainable GLA coalition, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
comprises Friends of the Earth in London, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Council for the Protection of Rural England—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Obviously all these organisations are supported by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. I shall pass on his grunts to the organisations concerned, and I am sure that they will be even more enamoured of him than they might have been before. The coalition also includes the London Wildlife Trust, English Nature and the Environment Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those bodies believe that sustainability is important and that, as the Minister said in the last debate, there ought to be targets and achievable goals and that we ought to know how to measure them. They believe that the issue should be seen in the context of delivering the Rio Agenda 21. The goal is to make London a more, not less, pleasant place to live with every year that passes. We want a less polluted, less congested city which is capable of preserving and enhancing the lives of all its inhabitants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People's views will differ on whether the Government were right to replicate strategies covered in clause 1. Nevertheless, they will find it appropriate mat those strategies, however many may be involved, should be incorporated under the umbrella of one sustainability strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall

	<i>Interruption.</i>] I repeat: almost to a man.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, I support my hon.

As such, he understands the strength of feeling that exists in the borough of Hillingdon in favour of the preservation of the environment in the broader sense. I support the amendment, which, in tandem with the London biodiversity action plan, will ensure that there is a double check on the mayor's commitment to the preservation of the environment and will guarantee that the issue is given the priority that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that the previous head of the RSPB had spent a great deal of time attempting to destroy the previous Conservative Government. That is another plus on behalf of an already admirable organisation.

I pay due tribute to the legal training of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. It is astounding and admirable that he was able to spend the first part of this

	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
afternoon's sitting arguing against the inclusion of strategies in the Bill and then, as soon as the Committee had successfully negated that proposal, begin to argue for the absolute necessity for a strategy's inclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His concern that the Bill makes no provision for sustainable development is not borne out by the facts. Clause 25(3)(b) refers to the desirability of
	<br><blockquote><p>"promoting sustainable development in Greater London".</p></blockquote>
Within the space of 30 seconds, the hon. Gentleman argued first that it would be appalling to include a strategy in the Bill and then that it is overwhelmingly important that the Bill should include it. That is an illogical position. He is arguing for an overarching strategy while at the same time saying that there should be no strategies underneath the arch, which is somewhat bemusing. We have already made it clear that it is within the mayor's power to devise any strategies that he or she believes will help to deliver the general purposes of the Bill. The mayor and the assembly will not be assisted in delivering strategies for pan-London improvements—which is what we are discussing—if the mayor is tied to a hierarchical approach to those strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from increasing the powers of the mayor or the democratic remit, the proposal of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey would limit the powers of the mayor—something he argues, erroneously, that the Government intend to do under the Bill. For the mayor to observe an hierarchical structure to those strategies would take away the freedom of the mayor and the assembly to act and react to what they discover as their strategies are put into place, and the ability of the people of London to express directly to the mayor and the assembly areas in which they wish more—or possibly less—to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"promoting sustainable development in Greater London".</p></blockquote>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had already managed to establish with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that his interpretation of the word "review" within the context of the Bill is markedly different from mine. For the hon. Gentleman, the word "review" means doing absolutely nothing. For me, the word is an additional spur to even greater development of pan-London strategies to improve not only the economy of London, but the health and social quality of life.

In the light of the arguments that I have put forward, I trust mat the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sad mat the Minister did not give a more positive response. I shall have one more go at persuading her, and even if she does not accept me amendment today, I am still hopeful that the logic of the case, if not my argument, will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 33 takes from the rest of the Bill the strategies covered elsewhere and lists them—unnecessarily, as we have argued. It then gives power to the mayor to review and revise them—unnecessarily, as we have argued. It then sets out what the mayor must take into account when considering them. We think that sensible, subject to qualification, but it did not need repeating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list of strategies was originally spelt out on page 22 of me White Paper. It includes spatial development, which nearly got left out, but which is about to be reintroduced,. The White Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As explained in chapter 5, the Mayor will be required to produce separate strategies for"—</p></blockquote>
followed by a list. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is obviously important that these different documents are mutually consistent. To that end, the Mayor may wish to consider a single over-arching strategy statement which sets clearly and succinctly the Mayor's key economic, environmental and social objectives."</p></blockquote>
Let me say to me hon. Lady mat there has been no inconsistency. I explained very carefully in t he earlier debate the sequence of the two amendments. I am grateful for the support of Conservative Members on the Committee. However many strategies end up in the Bill—the Government have put in six already, but this would apply even if there were only two—there should be some way of pulling them together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this day and age, the best way to define how the strategies can be pulled together is to ensure that they all fit under what is called a sustainable context for sustainable development. We may disagree about how that is defined, but in me White Paper the Government went half way towards accepting that view. Interestingly, it was at mat point that the Government said that the mayor could do this or that if he wanted. We were not arguing that there should be any strategies at all, but that the position should be left open. None the less, accepting me Government's premise that there will be strategies in the Bill, we ask that the mayor put them in an over-arching structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy not to press me amendment at the moment if the Minister is at least willing to tell me Committee that she will take the proposition away and discuss it with colleagues, especially those at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. There is clearly

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join those who have welcomed you to the Committee, Mr. Benton. You will find, as we all have, that one of the great pleasures of the Committee is that it will give you the chance to form an encyclopedic knowledge of the wit and wisdom of the hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I have broad sympathy with almost everything that he has said so far in Committee, but my sympathy is in inverse proportion to the length of time he takes to say it. I have almost felt at times that there is a filibuster at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I am about to make could apply to our previous debates and to many more to come concerning the exact powers and their degree, and the nature of the relationship that the Government need with the new authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to look at what we are doing in the context of the past. For 150 years of central Government, there has been a degree of suspicion about the nature of local government—it might be a threat, or too radical. That fear has come up in dozens of forms. Therefore, when I looked at the White Paper, I made a lot of recommendations. To my amazement, two seem to have resulted in changes in the Government's strategy; the other 200 have not yet found that favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not totally agree with the package, it seems a reasonable one for a new administration to get to work on during its first term or two. It would be wonderful to add everything in. I think that the GLA should be London's waste disposal authority, its health authority, its higher education authority; the list could go on almost ad nauseam. However, to begin to tackle problems of transport, urban decay and the terrible blight in parts of our city will be more than enough to keep an mayor and assembly incredibly busy for the first term or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It reminds me very much of when the old Greater London council was set up. After five years, the then Government gave it London Transport to get on with. The package is not a fixed one for all time: it will be added to and amended by future Administrations. Minister are not keen to emphasise it, but I think that it is the first step towards regional government for England. Therefore, as regional government spreads throughout the rest of the country, there will be changes that will have an impact on the already established Greater London authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the package without the suspicion expressed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, but with knowledge of the reality, the history, and the attitude of central Government towards anything new. Having done so, I think that it is just about the best package that could be put together at the moment within the Government's financial constraints. Therefore, if the hon. Government is hoping at some time to provoke me to break ranks on this or any other issue—if he is looking
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
for allies among Labour Members—I should say that I do not distrust the Government on it. I speak as one who never gives the Government the benefit of any doubt, even if they are my own Government—I am inherently unlikely to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall package hangs together. It will not help to add a lot of bits and pieces and try to define them too closely, or to worry too much, as in the previous debate, about what the Government may do or whether they may intervene. Once the mayor and the assembly are established, the Government will give them some freedom to act quickly and without interference. We do not need endless debates of this nature because the package hangs together reasonably well and provides more than enough work for the first two terms of the new authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I enjoyed a reputation for patience while I was in Northern Ireland. I wish to tell a short moral tale that involves a Polish bishop arriving in a parish in his diocese and inquiring of the cure why he had not been greeted by the sound of bells. The cure said, "There are, my Lord, three reasons, the first is that there are no bells." "Pray go no further," said the bishop. I have a feeling that the bishop was a Tory and that the cure was a Liberal Democrat. The initial answer that the Minister for Transport in London gave—that the matter is covered in clause 25(3)(b)—really provided game, set and match to the discussion. If we are to complete consideration of the Bill, we ought to get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The powers are in the Bill, and sustainable development will be at the centre of the approach of the mayor and the assembly to implementing the strategies. Indeed, how can sustainable development be delivered without the kind of strategies listed in the Bill? The powers are there should the mayor and the assembly wish to introduce another strategy.

I repeat my view that the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, is unnecessary and I ask him to withdraw it.

The Government amendments relate to the spatial development strategy that is already set out from clause 226 onwards. However, although the spatial development strategy is covered in the Bill, it is right that the strategy should be listed along with the other fundamental strategies that are defined in clause 33.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is knowledgeable in planning matters and asks a pertinent question. The Bill is the first to mention a spatial development strategy. Spatial development is a development concept that is becoming increasingly current in the planning world. A wider approach than the more limited, traditional land use planning framework is envisaged by it. The phrase is familiar to all those involved in the planning process and it requires no special definition in the Bill. When we come to the relevant passages—clause 226 onwards—we will be able to discuss in detail the full implications of a spatial development strategy for Greater London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene, but I am no wiser about the meaning of the term.

Will the Minister explain what he means by the phrase? I do not think that any one understands it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not have the expertise in planning matters of the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman). I made it clear that we would have the opportunity to discuss the topic in considerable detail when we came to the part of the Bill that relates to planning matters. We are discussing a technical amendment that is intended to ensure that the spatial development strategy is treated on a par with the mayor's other principal strategies. That, not a wish to discuss the ramifications of a spatial development strategy, is the purpose of introducing the reference now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon. Gentleman and to whet his appetite, I shall briefly explain the position now. Whereas land use planning has traditionally focused mainly on the allocation of uses for parcels of land, a spatial development strategy takes account of wider considerations, such as transport and linkages between different uses, as appropriate to the planning framework. We shall have an opportunity to discuss the subject in much greater detail later. I hope that we can make some progress now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is spatial development the only strategy mentioned elsewhere in the Bill that was not in the list in clause 33 (1)? If so, was it left out accidentally and then put in because someone spotted it? Will the Minister want to include other strategies in clause 33?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman restraint his impatience, he would have received a full explanation. We did not include the spatial development strategy among the strategies listed in the clause because there is detailed provision relating to it in clause 226 and thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy must conform to the patterns that exist for planning in all other regions and areas of the country. It would be inappropriate to have a planning framework in Greater London separate from the one that exists in other parts of England. Therefore, provision was put into later clauses to set out the spatial development strategy and how it operates in terms that exactly mirror the planning framework that applies to all other relevant local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was why the spatial development strategy was not mentioned in the clause. On reflection, however. we concluded that it should be listed here so that there could be no possibility of any subsequent interpretation. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is not for us but for the courts to interpret legislation in future. It would be wrong for any inference to be drawn from the omission of spatial development from the list of key strategies. In answer to the other question that the hon. Gentleman asked, I should point out that those are all the strategies that are specifically mentioned in subsequent clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London has done, that that will not prevent the mayor from introducing other strategies. The strategies listed in the clause are the ones for which statutory provision is made in the legislation. They are all listed and we felt it right that the spatial development strategy should be listed too, to ensure that no inference could be drawn from its omission from the list and that all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
the principles that will apply, such as consistency between strategies, also clearly apply to the spatial development strategy. It is a common sense amendment and would achieve those ends. I commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 164 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, is unnecessary. By stating that the mayor should "have regard" to matters listed therein, clause 33(3) is already flexible in its effect.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that the Government compounded their own inconsistency over the previous amendment. It is all right to spell out a strategy whose periodicity will be dictated by the Secretary of State. Sustainable development is a bad thing: we cannot spell that out as a strategy for promulgation under the Bill. Spatial development is fine. It has to be plucked from the initial objectives and put into clause 33. Either all the objectives that merit a strategy ought to be in the clause in full—for example, the strategy for sustainable development, which we have just negatived, would please conservationists, environmentalists and so on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fault, I am sure, Mr. Benton, is mine. I was getting more excited than this little Government amendment merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an immediately apparent logical inconsistency in the Government's attitude. But it is important inasmuch as spatial development—we are not, for now, permitted a full definition of what it entails—has an immense connotation for our electors. I presume that it means achieving an appropriate ecological and environmental balance between economic development and associated transport projects, and so on—for example, the utilisation of land resources, to which the Minister referred in planning terms—and preserving good air quality, a clean environment and biodiversity. That is greatly significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated the green belt on the Floor of the House. A great many Londoners will no doubt be particularly keen to know how this proposed legislation will affect the preservation of the green belt around London. I declare an interest, as the president—unpaid—of the London

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was generous to say that I knew about planning. My knowledge is rather rusty. I no longer have the ambition that I had originally when I came to this House of becoming Britain's first minister of town, country and family planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be pedantic, but all previous legislation on spatial development, is known as town and country planning. It is therefore confusing to use a new phrase to describe elements of town and country planning. Town and country planning is about not just the position and size of buildings, but also the space between them. I will not press for the phrase "spatial development" to be altered, but a return to the traditional phrase would minimise confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet for telling us about his historic interest in indoor and outdoor activity. He revealed something new about his all-encompassing aspirations, and he is knowledgeable about planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odd that the Bill does not contain a definition of spatial development. We are trying to produce legislation that people understand. The phrase "spatial development" is unlikely to trip off the tongue, either in the Old Kent road—which is in my constituency—or in the Minister's constituency of Greenwich and Woolwich. We would do better to return to the old phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill includes a requirement for a list of consistent strategies, along with reasons for their inclusion. It is completely illogical not to include spatial development in such a requirement. Planning policy should be integrated with the other policies, so we support the amendment. We hope that its proposals will be included in the overarching sustainability amendment that the Government have yet to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the two key points made in interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will have a good opportunity to discuss fully the implications and ramifications of spatial development when we come to debate clause 226.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, I repeat the point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London. We have set a framework in which sustainable development objectives must be taken into account in all aspects of the authority's work. Provision for that is made in clause 25(3)(b), as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
said in an earlier debate. Such provision must be taken into account in discussions on the preparation of spatial development strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is false to suggest that we are giving preference to certain considerations at the expense of sustainable development. Sustainable development is central to the work of the Greater London authority, and the principle of sustainability will be taken into account in the framing of all the strategies. I therefore urge hon. Members to support this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mayor must produce a variety of strategies, but there is no way of measuring whether they work. The amendment would require the mayor to include within those strategies some measurable targets, which can be of his or her choosing. We are not being prescriptive, but we need to know whether a particular strategy is producing a positive outcome and to be able to measure its real effect. It is easy to have a strategy; it is words on a piece of paper. It is much more difficult to achieve results. I suspect that the Government will be sympathetic to the amendment because, as we well know, their hideously embarrassing Government annual report outlined the departmental targets set in the comprehensive spending review. There are too, the five key pledges made during the general election against which the Government said that they wished to be assessed, measured and judged. We therefore believe that they will support the principle of the amendment. I look forward to having the support of Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
how well or how poorly the authority is functioning, especially the mayor, who has executive responsibility. Prescriptive criteria of the kind proposed, important as they are, will probably not be as important as the more subjective and, perhaps, more qualitatively demanding assessment that the electorate as a whole will make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is crucial is the interpretation that the assembly will put on the performance of the mayoralty. That assessment of the assembly, qualified as it will be by the input of the electorate, needs to be measured against specific criteria set out at the start of each term of office.

In every sense these are important amendments and I am sorry that the Government did not include such phraseology in the Bill. The Government are very ready to give powers to the mayoralty, but reluctant to give any significance, even influence, to the assembly.

	<br><blockquote><p>"the Mayor would set a small number of clear benchmarks as part of each strategy, against which progress could be measured".</p></blockquote>
I have already made it clear that Labour's idea of review includes ensuring that outcomes are achieved. Of course, the new local authority "Best Value" regime will apply to the GLA. We should expect that to achieve much of what the hon. Gentleman intends.

We are still considering whether it will be necessary to legislate to achieve the relevant commitments. We should of course expect the mayor to set out a series of targets

We emphatically do not believe that it is important or necessary for the London strategy to be consistent with national policy. If the London government want to do something different from what central Government would do, it should be allowed so, to do. Otherwise, in the case of a Labour Government and Tory-run London government, the latter would be expected to do what the former required.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Europe legislates on matters at a European level, but it has no power to determine the United Kingdom Government's strategy on matters that are under the Government's jurisdiction. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Absolutely. There is no requirement on the Greater London authority to comply with the Government's wishes on strategy and policies for which the authority is responsible. Otherwise, what is the point of elections? We might as well have the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions as mayor and a member of the authority.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman provides another example of the secessionist politics of the Liberal Democrats. They want the government of London to resemble that of a quasi-state. They want, not local or city government, but an all-encompassing, quasi-state government. They know that they will never gain power at Westminster, so they try to build little empires in local government, but, the electorate will not accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unwise to suggest that something may never happen because, in politics, a week is a long time and the hon. Gentleman may be out as quickly as he came in. Less arrogance from those in power for a transitory period would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view of the hon. Member for Ilford, South explains why the Prime Minister claimed last year that the powers of the Scottish Parliament were like those of a parish council, and why the Government gave Scotland power to vary its taxes but subsequently said that Westminster would not allow it. Like many members of his party, the hon. Gentleman is a centralist. He has revealed his hand. We believe that a London government should do what Londoners want. If it wants to do things differently from central Government, it should be allowed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believed that the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) supported us because amendment No. 165 would omit "national policy and" from subsection (3)(a). I rejoiced to find fellow comrades in arms. However, I subsequently realised that their intention was to remove "national policy" from the middle of a phrase and replace it at the end. My moment of hope was shattered and followed by a moment of despair. The hon. Member for Croydon, South is about to explain the amendment. Whatever the Tory explanation, for heaven's sake let us limit the requirements and impositions on the Greater London authority. National obligations and our reactions to them should be put aside. Let us make London do only that with which it is obliged to comply by international agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I often endeavour to make the point that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey expressed at the beginning of his speech. Removing "national

	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
policy" from subsection (3)(a) and placing it in the list means that the mayor will have to "have regard to" national policy, rather than
	<br><blockquote><p>"need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with national policy."</p></blockquote>
That is an important distinction. We are at one with the hon. Gentleman on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point refers to lonely amendment No. 164. If it had been accepted, the mayor would have to have regard to national policy "wherever practicable". What the heck do we mean by national policy? Government amendment No. 215 in this group sets out their meaning for this clause. From that I gather that it would be policy set out, for example, in the White Paper. Even for this Bill what the Government said in the White Paper is not being transferred into legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the Government have climbed down on a number of tourism and health issues. Even the structure of clause 25 is different from the way it was envisaged in the White Paper. The important point—even if the Minister does not accept it—is that policy that is enunciated in a White Paper does not always transfer itself into legislation. The mayor may have to have regard to something which never becomes law. That would be preposterous. I urge the Minister to have a further think about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livingstone</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that nothing I did in a past life has led to these worries about consistency with national and international policies. I recall that Baroness Thatcher's Government were rather upset when the GLC opened trade negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Bearing in mind how much time I spent with expensive lawyers at the GLC, I can see that these words are open to a variety of meaning and parameters. Lawyers could have a field day if an imaginative and resourceful mayor extends the boundaries of his responsibility. I suspect that ultimately none of this will matter as much as the simple safeguard built into the Bill that every year the mayor must go cap in hand to the Government for £3.5 billion. That will be the real determinant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is reasonable for an authority to have regard to national policy. Any responsible elected authority could do only that. Were it not to do so and were it to be oblivious to the background of national policy, it would soon go off the rails, leading to a misapplication of resources and ineffectiveness on behalf of the electors. But to say that it has a need to ensure that its strategy is consistent with national policy goes far beyond having a due, proper and appropriate regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As usual, Her Majesty's Government reveal a highly dictatorial attitude in this wording and they are, of course, hypersensitive to the European ramifications. There is the need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with international obligations. I hope that the authority would so conduct its business to ensure that the capital is the outstanding capital city of Europe, better by far than Brussels, and would set an example which would mean
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
that all Governments of this country could foreswear any deference to Brussels and those who have power therein and over us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find this phraseology objectionable on two counts. First, the Government are not prepared to see an authority elected in London which might pursue a distinct policy line from that adopted by Her Majesty's Government. The electors of London may with good reason want a different kind of authority, in ideology and practice distinct from and better than the Government that appertains at Whitehall. It should be allowed to do so. That is the variety of representation that our balance of national and local government has always provided hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the international obligations, I have never before seen a provision of this kind in local government legislation. Perhaps it is because of the regional dimension, to which the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) referred. He said that he regarded the authority as a prototype for regional government within England. We all know that regions in an European Union context must have an appropriate relationship with the European Union. The Government may be fearful that a highly effective mayor and assembly may secede—a word from the demoniac vocabulary of the hon. Member for Ilford, South. International obligations are not normally required to be met in local government legislation. I ask the Government, and the Ministers in Committee, today to explain exactly why that stipulation has been put into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall address the amendments standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction. These are tidying-up amendments which I urge the Committee to accept. They relate to the conditions to which the mayor will have a duty to have regard in preparing strategies. They would amend the definition of "national policies" to which the mayor has to have regard to ensure that it is consistent with the definition used in part VIII of the Bill—regarding planning provisions, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original definition set out in part II did not include published documents—policy planning guidance, for example—but included only documents formally laid before or presented by a Minister to Parliament. the amendments would correct that anomaly and ensure that the broader definition were used throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, several documents that represent statements of national policy are not always formally laid before Parliament. That does not mean that such documents should not be a material consideration when the mayor is preparing his or her strategies. For example, the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred to a White Paper not automatically becoming part of legislation. He and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in their attempts to probe the Bill mentioned that in some instances words in the White Paper were not precisely replicated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South also referred to the Government's failure to touch on tourism. As I said to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, that comes under the heading of culture, and we shall deal with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
amendments on that subject later. That issue was touched on earlier this afternoon. I am somewhat surprised that the hon. Gentleman has forgotten in such short a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments standing in the name of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which strike me—and clearly others on the Government Benches—as utterly bizarre. My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South referred to the increasing externalisation of the secessionist policies of the Liberal Democratic party. The hon. member for Southwark, North and Bermondsy seems to want the mayor and the assembly to be able to ignore international obligations. Does he really wish the mayor and the assembly to have no regard for the international obligations that national Governments have put in place—obligations to, for example, the European Court of Human Rights, or the obligations of this country to take asylum seekers or offer sanctuary to the victims of torture? I see that the hon. Gentleman wishes to intercede.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is misdirecting herself. The amendment left in international obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to know how the hon. Gentleman imagines that a mayor and assembly for London would be able to meet international obligations when international obligations are carried out by national Governments. I understand that the hon. Gentleman wants the mayor and the assembly to be able to ignore national Government policies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South said, the hon. Gentleman seems to be pushing for an independent, autonomous nation state. As we know from the hon. Gentleman's earlier definition of the real London, it would be an extremely small, autonomous nation state. The amendments are part and parcel of a philosophy propounded by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey which would in effect create a cordon sanitaire around this ever-shrinking capital city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again the Minister misunderstands the amendment, but that is not because the amendment is unclear. We are all governed by international obligations, the state as well as its citizens. That is why the amendment leaves that requirement in. We merely want to remove the obligation to ensure that the strategy of the London mayor is consistent with national policy. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that I would be very interested to know whom the hon. Gentleman supposes would adopt the role of foreign secretary within the GLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot have international agreements conducted by either a citywide government or a local authority. International agreements are made after argument and debate between independent nation states. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is clearly much attracted to the idea—I have little doubt that he would love to see a unilateral declaration by the mayor and the assembly that they were seceding from the European Union. I do not know how that action would square with the Government's clear commitment to the City of London corporation being the central financial capital of that European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
The amendments of the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Croydon, South are not only unnecessary but unworkable and bizarre. I find them almost insulting to the people of London, in as much as they imply that it is impossible for the people of London to be simultaneously loyal to their borough, to this great capital city and to the nation state. I therefore ask the hon. Gentlemen to withdraw their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has clearly chosen to misrepresent and misunderstand the amendments. I will not withdraw them because they raise an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
International obligations commit the state and thus its citizens. That would remain the case. Of course such obligations become national policy, because they have to be adopted. We exempted them purposely because we as a country subscribe to international obligations. We have no objection to that. However, as was clear in what I said and in what the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, we object to the fact that the mayor must have regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with national policy".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South pointed out, national policy is widely defined as being prospective as well as actual policy. the hon. Lady is wrong to call it secession; it is pluralist politics with tiers of government and a separation of powers between the nation state, regional government and local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already called it secessionist but now it is schizophrenic. It is bizarre to argue that a nation state can reach international agreement, but that it may not reach agreement in the national interest and that local government should be outside that agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the Minister chooses not to understand. Of course national government can adopt policies. We are saying merely that the mayor should not have to have strategies consistent with national policies. That is all, It is very simple. The Minister clearly wishes the mayor to have strategies that are consistent with national policies, but we think that the mayor and the assembly should be free to decide, within the powers that are given to them, their own strategies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

International criteria on pollution would be binding on national Governments. Suppose that our national Government decided to introduce obligations that were more stringent than the international requirements on air pollution. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that the London authority or the mayor should have the power to impose less stringent criteria than those that apply nationally? Air pollution is both national and international. Does the hon. Gentleman not therefore agree that it would be ludicrous for the city not to have to meet national policy obligations? He is trying to turn the clock back two-and-a-half thousand years to the ancient Greek city states, and completely ignoring the realities of the world in which we live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. Let me first deal with his hon. Friend. If there is an international obligation, we will be bound by it. If the Government have a national policy that is not legislated for, London should be free to dissent from it. What is the point of having a London government if every national policy must be adopted? London's government would merely be a cypher that endorses the national Government. The Government may, of course, introduce Bills that require action by London's government, as it regularly does in the case of other bodies such as the police and the fire authorities. However, let us ensure that London's government has only to do what central Government specifically requires it to do, rather than creating a general requirement that every single Government policy must be followed by London's government. That is madness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dismore</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman still has not answered my specific point about pollution. The Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Bill, which was enacted last year, set targets: those targets are laid down as policy, not as legislation. That legislation was vehemently supported by the hon. Gentleman's party as it progressed. Is he now saying that the London authority should ignore the policy that has been set by national Government when setting its road traffic reduction targets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly does not remember that debate or understand the argument. Of course the London authority has to know what national policy is and take account of it. However, if a separate duty had not been placed upon London's government in a road traffic reduction Bill, or elsewhere, it should naturally be free to have targets that are not as tough as the Government might wish. I would probably argue that it should have tougher targets, but it should be London's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more acute example is that of tax. The Government's policy is to tax rich people no more than less rich people—to have a 40 per cent. top rate. Liberal Democrats Members argue that London's government, in common with those of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, should have the power to raise and lower, for the purposes of London's functions, the amount of money that Londoners pay. There should not be an upper or a lower cap. We believe in giving power to people rather than holding on to it. That is the difference between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party. The hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had the privilege of moving an amendment that stands in my name, and which appears to enjoy the support of the Liberal Democrats. If they move into a "Passport to Pimlico" mode, I may disown their rapport later. At the moment, however, I am delighted to have their support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least one of the Ministers took part in the 1997 debate on the governance of London, as did the hon. Member for Brent, East, one or two other hon. Members in the Room and I. In that debate, I referred to the disadvantages that had flowed from the Abercrombie plan and from the consequent reduction in manufacturing in London. I referred also to Lord Stallard's unhappiness when he and I served on Camden borough council at the fact that Greater London council transport regulations had effectively destroyed the piano industry in his ward. That example is important to the piano industry and to Lord Stallard's ward, and it may be relevant to my amendment, if the piano industry was globally competitive at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London is very important to the United Kingdom's global competitiveness. For obvious constituency reasons, I shall cite the single example of financial services, whose current work force in Britain is now equal to that of manufacturing. I recognise that such services are practised outside London, notably in Edinburgh. London is, however, central to the financial services industry. I acknowledge also that other industries are relevant besides financial services. Within my own constituency, I could cite information technology, tourism and media-related activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree with the Lord Mayor of London, Lord Levene, that the City of London will lose out if Britain does not join the euro in the next three or four years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Benton, would immediately rule me out of order if I were diverted by that question. At present, the Governor of the Bank of England and Lord Levene, the Lord Mayor of London, take different views, but that is not a matter for debate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Committee members may not like globalisation. I am not wholly sure that I like it myself, but it is a fact of life with which we have to live and which necessarily has a strategic impact. The mayor will have plenty of powers, provided for later in the Bill, to stop things happening. That is a line with a well-known British characteristic—thinking of reasons for not doing things. In respect of global competitiveness, it will also be important for the mayor to have powers to enable him to push things forward and to desist from stopping things because of the possible effect on global competitiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are a business-friendly Government, so I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to the amendment. If I am hoist with my own petard, and the Minister points out other parts of the Bill in which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
matter is more than adequately dealt with, I shall, unlike some members of the Committee, grin and bear it and move on to the next amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 168 is broadly in line with the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend, so I will not dwell on it. My right hon. Friend put the case admirably. Amendment No. 169 invites the mayor to consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"the compliance costs for business and the impact on employment"</p></blockquote>
in Greater London. That is important and consistent with our earlier argument about compliance. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the amendment. If the Government are to require strategies and prescribe what the mayor should take account of, what is mentioned in the amendment should be listed. We argued that the strategies should not be written into the Bill, but if they are to be there, the amendment suggests a perfectly proper subject for inclusion. We urge the Minister to be positive toward the lead amendment, and toward those grouped with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an admirably brief debate, which was elegantly introduced by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I shall try to give him the response that he wants as quickly and as elegantly as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the right hon. Gentleman back to clause 25, which specifies in subsection (1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Authority shall have the purpose of promoting economic and social development in Greater London and the improvement of the environment in Greater London."</p></blockquote>
Clause 25(3)(c) amplifies that by stating that the matters to which the authority shall have regard include
	<br><blockquote><p>"facilitating the creation of wealth in Greater London".</p></blockquote>
I hope that that makes it clear to the right hon. Gentleman that we place the issue of London's financial success and economic competitiveness absolutely at the core of the role of the new body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the promotion of inward investment will be an important part of that role, and that will be covered under the economic development strategy, to which we referred when debating clause 33, which mentions the mayor's strategies. The London Development Agency strategy will be prepared under clause 33(1)(b). Those provisions of the Bill meet the right hon. Gentleman's concerns, so I urge him to withdraw his amendment, because it is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I urge the hon. Member for Croydon, South not to press his amendments. We have already discussed consultation in our debate on clause 25, and have given a clear undertaking further to consider the definition of the duties to consult, including consulting the business community, so I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press amendment No. 168.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 169 appears a tad eccentric. When drawing up his or her strategies, the mayor will obviously have to bear in mind compliance costs for business and
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
their impact on employment. If the mayor were not to do so, he or she would be failing in his or her duty. Public safety will also obviously be an important consideration for the mayor in formulating his or her strategies, not least because of the close relationship that the mayor will have with the new London fire and civil defence authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that all the considerations raised by the amendments are fully and satisfactorily covered elsewhere in the Bill, I urge the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the graciousness with which he responded to my amendment and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. I have one misgiving about the argument that he deployed. He implied that the two provisions that he cited—in clauses 25 and 33—embraced the issues raised by my amendment. It would be possible for the global competitiveness of London to be harmed without contradicting the clauses that the Minister cited. I am sure that he is not claiming that every single thing that involves economic development or the creation of wealth in Greater London would naturally be supported by the Government. I will pause before deciding what to do about the amendment if the Minister will respond on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the right hon. Gentleman's challenge. In certain circumstances, an economic development strategy that was being developed in London might conceivably not accord with every aspect of the regional development policies that the Government were pursuing. I find it difficult to believe, however, that the economic development strategy for London would not be about securing inward investment and improving London's competitiveness. For that reason, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman accepts that the concerns that he voiced will be properly covered and that the mayor will be able to act properly in the interests of the people of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have not called me to respond, Mr. Benton, but I am trying to speed up the proceedings. As some hon. Members will know, I see all life through the filter of cricket. On this occasion, I will give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and not press the amendment. Whether my hon. Friends press theirs is a matter for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 315, in page 19, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(ca) the desirability of public participation in the preparation of the strategy,'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 317, in clause 34, page 20, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(f) the general public to the extent that he considers practicable.'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 318, in page 20, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) In discharging the duty under subsection (1)(f) above, the Mayor shall report to the Assembly on the arrangements he has made.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be pleased to know that the amendments are almost self-explanatory. Amendment No. 315 is entirely self-explanatory and is included only because I thought that we might lose the vote on whether to get rid of the relevant part of the Bill. I thought, therefore, that we should comprehensively ensure public participation in the drawing up of the mayor's strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 317 is arguably more important. It would specifically write into clause 34 that the general public should participate when the mayor prepares or revises any strategy. At present, the clause allows the mayor to talk to any other person or body, but that could imply a legal entity or an authority; the public are not mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most important of all is amendment No. 318. We argue that a report should be made to the assembly on the arrangements that the mayor makes when carrying out his or her strategy. For the purpose of the amendment, we accept that the balance of power between the mayor and the assembly will remain weighted towards the mayor. None the less, if the mayor is going to consult, he or she must tell the assembly what process is involved and allow it to have an input into that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand what public participation means; it probably means nothing whatever. It is probably another of those silly warm phrases that people trot out without thinking too much in the belief that they add somewhat to the Bill's value. I doubt that it will. Does public participation mean focus groups or mass meetings? Does it mean sending a questionnaire to every household in London? I do not know what it means in the present context. We should put nothing of the kind in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take exception to amendment No. 317 because, even though the term "general public" is, I regret to say, used on notices in the Palace of Westminster, it is a tautology. I have never understood how the public could be anything other than general. If someone can point me to a specific public, I might go along with the amendment. On the grounds of tautology and incomprehensibility, therefore, I support neither of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has made a strong case against the amendments and I do not intend to detain the Committee long, but they are unnecessary and create the impression that the Liberal Democrat party is more interested in talking than in getting things done. That impression has been conveyed quite a lot during the Committee's sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
The amendments are unnecessary because, as the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will know, clause 34(1) imposes obligations on the mayor to consult widely in the preparation of all the strategies. Clause 34(1)(e) provides for the duty to consult to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other body or person whom he considers it appropriate to consult".</p></blockquote>
I cannot see the benefit in including consultation of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the general public to the extent that he considers practicable".</p></blockquote>
That strikes me as otiose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the requirement to report back to the assembly, the hon. Gentleman will be aware—we shall consider the relevant clauses later—of detailed requirements in the Bill for the mayor to report monthly to the assembly explaining his actions, and making him accountable to the assembly for those actions. A satisfactory framework will exist for ensuring public participation in the preparation of the strategies through proper consultation, reporting back, and accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the hon. gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made quite a good point about the words "public" or "general public", and perhaps that term of art should be amended. The other matters are not hugely important and I shall not pursue them now. I hope, however, that before the Bill is passed we shall be sure of maximising the public's opportunity to participate in the processes that form the obligations of the mayor and assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 19, line 31, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(f) the desirability of promoting harmony, equity and mutual respect between members of different ethnic groups'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the amendment, which concerns an important issue, although I do not pretend that the drafting is perfect. If we are to include in the Bill important issues to which the mayor should have regard in preparing strategy, among those obligations should be the promoting of harmony, equity and mutual respect between members of different ethnic groups. It is just conceivable, although I pray God it will never happen, that a mayor whose natural instinct was not to do that could be elected. In that eventuality if the law at least stated that it was the mayor's duty there could be some recourse through the courts or otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will become more apparent than it has for some time been, following the publication of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report, that, below the surface—we had a good debate about this in the Committee of the whole House, with regard to thresholds—there is always potential for ethnic and racial disagreement and differences to turn into something worse. I do not doubt the wish of all Committee Members to ensure that the new London authority will accommodate all ethnic communities and encourage more harmony and mutual respect between them. However, I hope that the amendment will be a reminder that the inclusion in the Bill of issues such as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V002P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
river transport and biodiversity, but not the desirability of what I have explained, would send very unsatisfactory signals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attached to the wording of the amendment and do not hold a brief for its perfection, but I hope that we can arrive at some way of showing that as the Minister for Transport in London explained very well on the Floor of the House, we want to be seen to be committed to the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this country has some of the best race relations laws in the world, which is why it is a stable country. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey makes an important point and we wish to be associated with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all wish to be associated with the hon. Gentleman's comments. Many of us are elected from constituencies with a variety of racial groups. I just wonder whether the wording of the amendment will achieve the purpose. I should have thought that the best way to promote
	<br><blockquote><p>"harmony, equity and mutual respect"</p></blockquote>
was not by spinning it out in statute but by leading example, and demonstrating that the mayor heads an authority that in every way promotes these ideals. The inclusion of that phrase would mean that all times the provision would conceivably be justifiable, not against poor performance in a benign and just way, but in a malign manner by people using the legislation to demonstrate, maliciously, that the mayor and his authority were racist, bigoted, inequitable or divisive in their policy to ethnic groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise entirely with the Liberal Democrats' objectives, but wonder whether they are achievable. We know that much race relations legislation can have negative consequences inasmuch as there is a backlash against it. The suggested phrase could not in any sense be so construed, but we must be ultra-cautious in matters relating to race.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had thought that the general purposes and objectives of the assembly as set out in clause 25 were sufficient. "Social development" must surely mean the development of a racially cohesive, equitable, tolerant and positive society whose constituent elements, regardless of race, bring their respective qualities to the assembly's work and to the people of London for the good of all. I have my doubts about the amendment. I would not go so far as to vote against it, but it is worth injecting a note of caution, good as the intention behind the amendment may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gapes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I have not done so before today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reasonably happy with the idea of mentioning those aspects, but I wonder whether the wording should be considered further. London will not be a separate state—it will be governed by race relations, crime and disorder, and equal opportunities legislation, and by all other legislation applying to the United Kingdom, or to England and Wales if there is separate legislation for Scotland.
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
Therefore, wording relating to discrimination must be sensitive to other Acts that will apply to other matters in this city. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will withdraw the amendment so that Ministers may reconsider it, or at least try to ensure consistency. The worst outcome would be legislation that differed from other Acts dealing with the same matters. That would lead to a field day for lawyers and perhaps difficulties of the kind that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood mentioned. We must be careful to achieve consistency between the Bill and other measures applying to London and other parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contributions from the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, for Ruislip-Northwood and for Croydon, South and from my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South makes it clear that this Committee is unanimous in believing that racism or any form of prejudice that is based on skin colour or religion is anathema. That opinion is, I believe, shared by Parliament as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, racism is an issue of great sensitivity in our remarkable capital city, with its vast range of ethnic groupings. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey touched on a recent, scandalous and appalling case, from which lessons continue to learned. I do not believe that Londoners—with the exception of a comparatively small minority—have any great desire to foster the prejudice and enmity to which the hon. Gentleman referred obliquely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His amendments aim to eradicate such prejudice; no one would disagree with their desired outcome. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South said, there are other legal frameworks. For example, clause 265 makes provision for section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976 to apply to the Greater London authority. The GLA will therefore be under the duty that applies to other authorities. Section 71 of the Race Relations Act requires them
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make appropriate arrangements with a view to securing that their various functions are carried out with due regard to the need—

	<ol>

	<li>to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination; and</li>

	<li>to promote equality of opportunity, and good relations, between persons of different racial groups."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood pointed out, the general purposes specified in clause 25 lay a duty on the GLA. Clause 33 specifies that the authority has a general purpose to promote economic and social development in Greater London, as well as environmental improvements. Clearly, eradicating bad race relations is a major part of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I intended to re-examine the wording of clause 25 to determine whether amendments are necessary to clarify the authority's general purpose. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised an issue of great importance, and did not make a dogmatic insistence that the wording of his amendment is necessary to deliver its desired outcome. We will address the issues raised by his amendment, and, in the light of that commitment, I hope that he will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept the Minister's offer and am grateful for the interest that has been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was not tabled in the belief that it would deliver a perfect outcome. Indeed, it might be better to include a statement in other places, such as the purposes section mentioned by the Minister. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood—that we do not want complicated litigation. I accept, too, the point made by the hon. Member for Ilford South—that we must not replicate obligations under mational legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government made clear their commitment to getting such issues right in the Bill. That is important, and I hope that the Minister will collaborate with us. If we, as a three-party Committee, can agree, that would be in everybody's interest, and I would be happy to withdraw the amendment and talk to the Minister later.
