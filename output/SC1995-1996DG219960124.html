	<div class='legislation'>Draft Companies Act 1985 (Miscellaneous Accounting Amendments) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Phillip Oppenheim)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the draft Companies Act 1985 (Miscellaneous Accounting Procedures) Regulations 1996."</p></blockquote>
I shall say a little about the purpose of the draft regulations. As members of the Committee will know, the draft regulations in the main simplify or repeal a number of specific accounting disclosure requirements of the Companies Act 1985, thereby removing provisions that have been superseded by other requirements or are otherwise no longer warranted. The draft regulations also rectify a technical problem that was identified in relation to audit exemptions for 'off-the-shelf companies and correct some anomalies that were identified in the implementation of the insurance accounts directive. In addition, they include a new requirement for public limited companies and their large subsidiaries to publish their payment policies in their directors' report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of the new requirement requiring disclosure in the directors' report of a company's policies—of which I shall say more later—the draft regulations, taken as a whole, should reduce the administrative and other costs to companies in complying with the disclosure requirements of the 1985 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accounting provisions in the 1985 Act have grown up over many years. Some have come from reports by company law committees, some deal with specific problems and others implement the European Community's accounting directives. Companies also comply with disclosure requirements in accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board. Listed companies must also meet the disclosure requirements of the stock exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that reconciling such a multiplicity of requirements imposes considerable compliance costs on companies preparing accounts. Therefore, as part of the company law reform programme and the Government's wider deregulation initiative, our aim has been to review statutory accounting requirements. Our intention is to reduce the burden that such costs impose on companies wherever possible, while at the same time ensuring that the information to be provided meets the reasonable needs of users of accounts, such as shareholders, banks, creditors and others dealing with a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The draft regulations represent a useful step in simplifying the disclosure requirements of the 1985 Act, by making them easier to comply with and by reducing the overall regulatory burden on some companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although many of the amendments are highly technical, they have been widely welcomed and are strongly supported by those who took part in the consultation exercise that preceded the draft regulations. Many people responded to the consultations and almost all were wholly supportive of the proposed changes. I should like to put on record my thanks to all those who contributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft that is before the Committee is in a slightly different form to that which was originally laid before both Houses. The original draft contained some minor amendments to the defective accounts provisions of the 1985 Act. While the bulk of the regulations are to be made under section 257 of the 1985 Act—which provides for an affirmative procedure where, overall, the burdens of part VII of the Act are increased—the amendments to the defective accounts regulations were to be made under section 245, which provides only for a negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Counsel to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments drew my Department's attention to the fact that it was incorrect to combine regulations subject to a negative parliamentary procedure with those subjective to an affirmative procedures, unless such a combination is contemplated in the enabling Act. My Department is grateful to Counsel to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments for drawing that to our attention. The draft that is before the Committee therefore contains no amendments to the defective accounts regulations. We shall bring these forward shortly in a separate instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of the new requirement for disclosure of payment policies in the directors' report, which will apply solely to public limited companies and their large subsidiaries, and those provisions relating exclusively to insurance companies, the draft regulations as a whole apply to the entirety of registered companies regardless of size or business type. However, in practice the provisions relate mainly to the accounts of large companies as small companies are already exempt from a number of disclosure requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning now to the new requirement that public limited companies and their large subsidiaries disclose their payment policies in the directors' report, I should like to say a little about the background to this measure. The 1994 White Paper, "Competitiveness—Helping Business To Win", announced a package of new measures to help tackle the problem of late payment of commercial debt. One of the key elements in that package was the introduction of a requirement for public limited companies to publish their payment policies in the directors' report, thereby providing suppliers and others with information on how they can be expected to be treated by such companies, and thus giving additional data on which to base decisions on, for example, supply and pricing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
In February 1995 the Department of Trade and Industry consulted the business community on the form of the statement that directors would be required to make. The statement was to be based on whether the company follows any code of practice on prompt payment. Companies would either disclose that they complied with such codes, including the proposed new industry-led British standard, or they would disclose that they complied with principles of good practice to be specified in these proposed regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of those responding to the consultation were in favour of this policy, although a number of respondents pressed for alternative measures. A further round of consultation, based on the text of the draft regulations as a whole was undertaken in October last year. The response to the new disclosure requirement was favourable. The new disclosure requirement will apply only to public limited companies and large private companies which are subsidiaries of public limited companies. We estimate that there are approximately 11,900 public companies. The new requirement will come into force in relation to accounts for financial years ending after 24 March 1996, although the information to be provided will be in respect of the payment policy for the forthcoming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Requiring public limited companies to publish details of their payment policies should prove a real disincentive to poor practice. Chairmen will not want publicly to admit that their companies do not have a policy of paying on time. Furthermore, the fear of being confronted with evidence that their stated policies and actual practice differ should help to ensure that directors take the necessary action to ensure that they pay promptly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new disclosure requirement represents an important step in the campaign against late payment and, when seen in the context of the other measures announced in the White Paper, underlines the Government's determination to tackle this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy recently announced that he will look further at the arguments for and against a statutory right to interest on overdue commercial departments and, in particular, whether that would help or damage small businesses. He has invited submissions from representative bodies who responded to the public consultation in November 1993. That fulfils the Government's commitment in the 1994 White Paper on competitiveness to look further at the arguments for and against the case for a statutory right to interest
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there has not been an improvement within the next two years".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy made clear, the incidence of late payment and new measures to address the problem are under continuous scrutiny. Clearly, the effect of this new requirement on the reporting of payment policies will be an important factor in the consideration of what additional measures may be required to address late payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Finally, I should like to reiterate the point that I made earlier, that all the measures contained in the draft regulations have been subject to full public consultation. They have been widely welcomed and are seen as a positive first step in simplifying the accounting disclosure requirements of the Companies Act. I commend the draft regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Grylls 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Surrey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rising to speak in a Committee such as this is usually unpopular. No doubt that is the case today, but I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Government on introducing the change to the policy on payment to creditors, which has been under consideration for many years. In my experience, small and medium-sized businesses do not want a statutory right to interest, which would be over-interventionist. The Government's proposals in part VI, on pages 5 and 6, represent a step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be helpful at least to try to shame public companies into adopting responsible policies on the payment of creditors. Some hon. Members may consider the measure too interventionist, but the free market, in which I believe as strongly as anyone, can be perverted by size if very large firms abuse their position. That is a threat to the good health of small and medium-sized firms. Modest intervention is necessary to discourage large firms from abusing their position and to shame them into paying their bills on time. The Government's proposals are a useful step forward and I hope that they will improve the cash flow of small and medium-sized firms, which is so vital for their health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other measures are deregulatory, reducing the amount of accounting information required from small firms, and are also to be welcomed. Our companies have been at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our European neighbours because our Companies Acts have required our small and medium-sized firms to disclose more information, causing them to have to pay their accountants more to prepare various unnecessary disclosures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A typical small firm comprises the owner-managers and perhaps half a dozen other people. Such firms do not need to disclose so much information. I am sure that the Government will come under pressure from larger firms not to deregulate, because large firms often want smaller firms to be forced to disclose information. That is how they find out how to take over smaller firms, creating more anti-competitive perversions of the market. Larger firms comb through the accounts of small and medium-sized competitors. There is no need for the disclosure of much of the information that is required to be contained in those accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am highly satisfied with the reduction in bureaucracy and the deregulation inherent in the measures. Without wishing to weaken my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Minister, I recommend that he considers raising the qualifying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
upper limit to include companies with a turnover of up to £4 million, which is the maximum allowed by the European Union. That figure still covers only tiddly companies, not even medium-sized ones. It is disappointing that we have not raised our limit to the maximum allowable because we shall continue to put our small and medium-sized firms at a disadvantage in comparison with their neighbours on the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not going up to that maximum is contrary to the spirit of deregulation, which should be to seize every opportunity to lift as much of the burden of regulation as is allowed by the Community. If we do not do that, our small and medium-sized firms will continue to face an unnecessarily tough accounting environment, which hobbles them in competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While congratulating the Minister, I hope that he will, in due course, re-examine the maximum with a view to raising it. I am sure that the Opposition spokesman shares the congratulatory mood of the Committee because the draft regulations are a step in the right direction for British businesses, especially smaller firms, and will help them to be more successful in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Cope 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the draft regulations, especially their deregulatory aspects. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his achievements in deregulation. However, like my hon. Friend the Minister for North-West Surrey (Mr. Grylls), I want to talk about the late payment provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are welcome, but they do not go far enough. It would be better if, in addition to making public limited companies state their future policy on payment terms and practice, they had to report on their practice in respect of the payment of debt during the previous 12 months. As politicians, we all know that practice can sometimes differ from policy. To cite a topical example, party policy in respect of selection in schools may be one thing, but the practice of the leaders of that party may be another. It is practice that matters, and the same applies to companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mere fact of having to state policy would not be as sharp an instrument for persuading large firms to pay promptly and follow their stated policies as being required to state what they had done in the past. Such requirement would be far more in keeping with the nature of annual report and accounts. Auditors report on the previous 12 months; the information in the accounts and in the directors' report is overwhelmingly concerned with the previous year's dealings. Some criticism is levelled at the fact that the reports only look backwards, but the hard fact of what has occurred in the company's finances is the core of the report and accounts. Asking a company to look ahead and to state its wishes for the future is not in keeping with the core element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going that stage further would impose an extra regulation, to which public limited companies and their large subsidiaries would have to conform. In that
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
sense, we would be going against the deregulatory mood that prevails among Conservative Members and which permeates the rest of the draft regulations; but the step forward would be small. The information already exists and is known to the company's auditors, and to require the information to be publicly stated would not be an onerous provision. It would be for the auditors to verify what had occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that late payment is a long-running problem. Public attention has been drawn to the issue by small business organisations, including the Small Business Bureau, of which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Surrey and I have the honour to be officers. For a long time, it has been a thorn in the side of businesses. However, I have always opposed statutory interest being charged on late debt—before I became the Minister with responsibility for small firms, while I was in that post, and since—because, as the Bradford university study has confirmed, many more small firms would suffer than would gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the draft regulations—especially if the improvement that I have suggested was added—would improve matters without penalising small businesses. The draft regulations would not apply to small businesses but only to public limited companies and their larger subsidiaries. With the reservation that they should have gone one stage further, I strongly support the draft regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Bell (Middlesborough)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for taking us through the draft regulations, and to the right hon. Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope) and the hon. Member for Surrey, North-West, for their contributions to the debate. I am the only Opposition Member here, but I shall not speak on behalf of my colleagues or on behalf of the hon. Member for North Devon (Mr. Harvey).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister discussed disclosure and accounting, and the problems relating to audit exemption and insurance, which he said were technical matters. I shall not spend much time discussing them. He also said that the reform will reduce costs, which all members of the Committee will welcome. With regard to shareholders and banks, the draft regulations will tidy up corporate governance, which I welcome. The Minister said that the regulations about late payment to small companies came from the White Paper about competitiveness. As the Minister, the right hon. Member for Northavon and the hon. Member for North-West Surrey said, late payment has been a problem for many years, and it will remain a problem, notwithstanding the passage of the draft regulations. Up to £50,000 million has been outstanding in the form of late payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of late payments is closely connected to the state of the economy. Those members of the Committee who are former business men or lawyers know that when the economy is in recession, payments tend to get later because people tend to hang on to their money. During such a period, there are many demands for the introduction of statutory interest. When the economy starts to pick up and the recession recedes,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
those demands become less strident and begin to recede. Small and medium-sized enterprises are responsible for themselves, and must take the requisite steps to make cash flow. The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants said that small businesses should be encouraged to do simple things well, such as ensuring that every invoice has a clear pay-by date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister was appointed to his present position, the Department of Trade and Industry produced a booklet called "Making the Cash Flow", which was part of its educational drive to develop a guide to best practice. Best practice could, in time, become the basis for the development of an accepted minimum standard of practice. That standard could become enforceable as best terms of trade, which could then be inscribed in all contracts. Therefore, the draft regulations represent a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Northavon mentioned a study that was carried out by Bradford University. Its findings are confirmed in a study that was carried out by Birmingham chamber of commerce, which found that the majority of its members were in favour of introducing legislation to establish a statutory right to interest. It also accepts that there are reservations about policing and the enforcement of such legislation. The Forum of Private Business, which represents the interests of micro-businesses,—those that have between one and 10 employees—introduced an early-day motion in the House in late 1994 which called for the right to statutory interest to be established on commercial debts. The early-day motion obtained the signatures of 328 Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, there are major reservations about the introduction of satutory interest. The problem is that the dominant party to a contract might merely change the contract's conditions, and force an extended payment period, or that contractural arguments could be used to delay payments. Many small companies might not exercise their right to statutory interest—if it were enacted—for the fear of disturbing their trading relationship. People with knowledge and experience in such matters have different opinions. The Birmingham chambers of commerce said that its members opposed the introduction of a standard for prompt payment; the majority view was that that standard would be difficult and costly to implement. However, others have not supported that view. That chamber of commerce also suggested that action to recover commercial debt through the small claims procedure could be more widely used to alleviate problems of late payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Past experience has shown that, while late payment is a problem, a greater problem is the Inland Revenue's behaviour in seeking VAT payments, which has forced many small companies into liquidation. The Committee is not considering that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party supports the regulations, which are a step forward. I agree with the hon. Member for North-West Surrey—unusual though that it—that it may be appropriate to raise the limit to cover companies with a turnover of up to £4 million.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
It is clear to us and to the Department of Trade and Industry that there is a difference between micro-business and macro-business. Companies with a work force numbering between zero and 10 require different conditions from those with a work force of between 10 and 500. The £4 million limit is not unduly high in the modern world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In supporting the measures, we also hope that they might be taken further at some stage to cover another point made by the hon. Member for North-West Surrey. Past practice is not recorded, but accountants will now have a menu on which to put the relevant information for the more than 11,000 companies to which the Minister has referred. If the measure has no effect on late payment, we may decide to ask companies to declare their practice during the previous 12 months.

We welcome the Government's initiative on deregulation. New Labour is in favour of deregulation. That is one of the recent changes in the party—I do not want to mention selection of schools. The terms of the draft regulations mirror terms which have come from other institutions, including the Labour party. Lyndon B. Johnson once said that if we all had the same facts, we should all reach the same conclusion. That has happened in this case. I do not want to dwell on the subject of my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Ms Harman), but during the Vietnam war, Lyndon Johnson used to bring Ministers opposed to the war into his office and tell them to go to France, Germany and Great Britain to explain why the war was just and why American policy was right. I do not want that to happen to my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham on matters currently in the news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be remiss of me not to refer the Minister to the statement issued last weekend by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), in which she pointed out that £208 million was paid late by the Government to firms in 1994–95. The Minister's predecessors have had to tackle the problem and have commented on it on the Floor of the House. The Treasury, the Department of Social Security, The Overseas Development Administration and the Department of National Heritage were able to say how much they had paid late. The Department of Trade and Industry, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Employment were not. The Government should seek to remedy its payment problems. We recognise the bureaucratic difficulties involved, but it would be helpful if the Government set an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not alone in that view. the Federation of Small Businesses has said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How can the Government say in one breath that it wants a solution to the problems of late payments, when its very own departments are guilty of major delays in their payment record? Setting an example should be paramount in Minister's minds."</p></blockquote>

I am not here to criticise—I recognise the difficulties that exist. We fully support the draft regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank members of the Committee for the spirit in which our short debate has been conducted. I shall take on board the points that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Surrey made about the upper limit. That issue will be re-examined. However, the present position is that any changes to the financial ceilings will have to take account of the consultative committee of accounting bodies' work on exempting small companies from certain of the existing accounting standards. The deadline for comments on that consultation is the end of March. We do not propose to make any changes before then, but we shall consider the issue. I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether we should require companies to disclose information about past payment policies reasonable, and it is a question that we considered carefully. We may return to it in future. The advice that we received from a wide range of sources was that there would be a number of problems with disclosure of past practice. Past practice is exactly that; it would provide information only about how suppliers were treated seven, eight, nine or 10 months earlier. While that might be useful, we felt that a company's future policy was more important. My hon. Friend the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy is examining the issue, and we are committed to take action should the draft regulations not operate as well as we should like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opinion was divided on the question of reporting past practice. Several organisations were opposed. One might have expected the British Retail Consortium to oppose it—its members tend to ask their customers for money up front, but they do not always pay their suppliers as rapidly as possible. Other opposing bodies included the Hundred Group, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Credit Management, the Law Society and the stock exchange. They were all concerned about certain aspects of such a requirement being imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell), for his constructive comments. It is indicative of the Labour party's lurch to the right that its representatives can make comments such as those made by the hon. Gentleman about deregulation. Of course, it is one thing to say that we are all in favour of deregulation—we are all in favour of motherhood and apple pie—but it is sometimes difficult to face up to vested interests, which are sometimes powerful and vociferous, and have access to the media. They often press for regulation in specific areas. It is politically harder to put a willingness to deregulate into practice when one is under intense political pressure to do the opposite. I hope that, if the hon. Gentleman becomes a Minister in a future Labour Government, he will remember that
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
it is important not only to pay lip service to deregulation, but to implement it even in difficult conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's remarks did not make it clear whether the Labour party is in favour of a statutory right to interest. Perhaps he will confirm that the Labour party is in favour of regulating for a statutory right to interest on late payment. I shall give the hon. Gentleman time to think about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green were right to raise the issue of late payment by Government Departments. It is not satisfactory for Departments to pay their suppliers late, and the problem has exercised Ministers minds for some time. However, I am able to report that some progress has been made. Whereas only 75 per cent. of the Treasury's invoices were paid on time in 1994–95, by the summer of last year that figure had risen to 89 per cent. In the Department of Trade and Industry the figure a year ago was 84 per cent. paid on time; it is now 93 per cent. Ministers take the issue seriously, and we are pressing our officials to ensure that improvements are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to speak again. I welcome the Minister's statement, and especially his reference to late payment by Government Departments. I know that the problem has exercised the minds of other Ministers before him. We recognise the problem and it is welcome that the Government recognise it and will do something about it if they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little remiss in not welcoming the statement that the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy had launched widespread consultation on statutory interest on late payment and had sought the views of a wide sector of industry, including small and medium enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have received, as have the Government, a variety of conflicting views from industry on the best way to ensure that frameworks are in place to reduce the incidence of late payment. The question of statutory interest is being considered by the Labour party. It is not yet a policy, but we have expressed our anxiety and have sought ways in which we believe the problem might be alleviated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to Lyndon Johnson who said that if we all had the same facts, we should all come to the same conclusions. That draft regulations include what we said some time ago about late payment—that the terms of payment can be settled with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction and by stating whether it is customary to follow any code or standard on payment practice and, if so, the name of the code or standard and the place where information about and copies of the code or standard can be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the draft regulations because they contain much that we have said in the past. The Labour party has made no decision on how to handle statutory interest. We welcome the consultation by the Department of Trade and Industry and look forward to the conclusions of that consultation. I surmise that there is not a great deal of difference between the

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Government and the Opposition in recognising the problems. We shall not be precipitate in leaping in to resolve those problems. There is a difference between a micro-business and a macro-business. We tend to link small and medium enterprises but the problems of micro-businesses with from one to 10 employees are not the same as those with from 10 to 500. By separating the two groups, we may be able to reach a conclusion on statutory interest on late payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister suggests is not Labour party policy, but we are considering the matter and will try to reach a conclusion—perhaps based on the Government's consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.8 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Opppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Opposition spokesman for that clarification and I welcome the significant change of tone from comments made last autumn by some shadow Front-Bench spokesmen, including the shadow Chancellor and the Leader of the Opposition. It is right to pause before going further
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
and my hon. Friends would be worried about intervention in contract rights. Procedures already exist for companies to obtain redress by stating in their contracts that late payment will be subject to interest. We are considering the problem, but it is worth saying that during consultation quite a large number of representatives of business were against a statutory right to interest, and they included not just the CBI but the Small Business Bureau and the Federation of Small Businesses. We are committed to act should that become necessary, but we hope that it will not become necessary because it would be interventionist and regulatory and might cause as many problems as it solved.
