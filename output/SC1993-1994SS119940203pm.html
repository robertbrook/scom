	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I refer to the report of Scope—the local government reorganisation in Scotland: a critical evaluation of costs, January 1994. It was the subject of some ribaldry about it being a party-political document. My point of order raises questions about the professional integrity and the professional advice given to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. I wonder whether hon. Members who scoff at the idea that it is non-political are aware that David Chynoweth is not only director of finance in the Lothian region, but was the United Kingdom president of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy last year. It is important to record the integrity of those who have given professional advice. They are not geared to party politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, is not a point of order for the Chair, but do not doubt the hon. Gentleman will pursue the matter further in debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>To move, That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 2 to 7, Schedule 2, Clauses 8 to 18, Schedule 3, Clauses 19 to 33, Schedule 4, Clauses 34 to 40, Schedule 5, Clauses 41 to 51, Schedule 6, Clauses 52 to 61, Schedules 7 and 8, Clauses 62 to 65, Schedule 9, Clauses 66 to 76, Schedule 10, Clauses 77 to 91, Schedule 11, Clauses 92 to 122, Schedule 12, Clauses 123 to 166, Schedules 13 and 14, Clauses 167 to 169, new Clauses, new Schedules—[

	<section>

	<div class='title'>LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 9, leave out from 'areas' to end of line 10 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'which ensure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources.'</p></blockquote>
A devasting report has been produced by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about the costs of this fiasco of a Bill. The amendment refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources." Until now, there has been little discussion about the costs of local government reorganisation. We hear about the back-to-basic issue, but today's debate is about getting back to real basics. The Government should be telling Scots about the true costs of reorganisation and about the basic issue of spending taxpayers' money wisely.</p></blockquote>
COSLA's figure show that the costs of this expensive fiasco could be as much as £720 million. More significantly, it states that there will be no savings. That should be contrasted with the financial memorandum which refers to
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
significant annual savings and transitional cost of only £196 million, which the Government hope will be partly offset by the first year of reorganisation in April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is about making a judgment about whom we believe. We do not accept the Government's figures, which I shall explain in a moment. We acknowledge that it is a complex issue that deals with the future and with matters that are difficult to quantify. The scale of the difference means that there is a huge credibility gap in anything that the Government say about costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parly Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman contrast the COSLA document with the one that all hon. Members received recently from Fife regional council? It showed that the unitary Fife authority—similar to the authorities that the Government propose—made savings of £75 million over 15 years, against transitional costs of £5.5 million. Does the hon. Gentleman accept Fife regional council's figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is nothing if not predictable. The Fife figures largely reflect the status quo. The Minister tries to confuse and obfuscate the real issues. What happens in Fife does not happen in Lanarkshire, Strathclyde or Lothian. It is disingenuous to say that savings can be made in one authority. I could ask the Minister about the savings that will be made through the butchery of Strathclyde, and Lothian and through other changes that will take place. I shall return to that issue later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, who are so contemptuous of public opinion and so arrogant in their approach to Scottish politics, should address the issues that appeared in the report today. Even if we were considering a set of proposals about which there was consensus, we would still despair about their costs. But we are discussing proposals for which there is no case, and no consensus. There are no proposals for constitutional change or for a commission. To add insult to injury, local Government will be ravaged financially to support the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks us to trust the COSLA figures on costs. Is that the same COSLA that tells local authorities not to comply with statutory requirements if the Bill becomes law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to pick my words carefully, because "rubbish!" comes to mind. The hon. Gentleman is wide of the mark. No discussions have taken place about breaching statutory responsibilities. The hon. Gentleman made an idle remark. I hope that he improves. It will be difficult for the Opposition—and some Government Members—to endure such comments for three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recklessly disregard public expenditure and suggest higher taxes for Scots. We know all about higher taxes that will impact on family budgets. We know that Tories cost more, but Scotland is to have its own special gerrymandered tax. The Government are guilty of ignoring the advice of some of the most distinguished organisations in Scotland. Unlike the Scottish Office, those organisations know something about finance. The Government deliberately deceive Scots about costs so that they can introduce a political reorganisation that has nothing to do with savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider when the mess was created. In October 1992, the then Secretary of State for Scotland said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In all of this we must pay heed to the issue of cost. Irrespective of the structure chosen …. I regard it as essential that the new system should be able to deliver services to the taxpayer at less cost."</p></blockquote>
That is not what the COSLA document says. Even if we give or take a few hundred million pounds, the reorganisation will cost taxpayers, families and the business community dear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement that I have quoted was vacuous. Matters went from bad to worse. The Government commissioned the famous Touche Ross report, which represents £50,000 of wasted public expenditure, simply to tell the Government what they wanted to know. A case of putting rubbish in, in the shape of a brief, and taking rubbish out, in the shape of a document. I have no qualms about saying that. If, when the Opposition are in the Scottish Office, we spend £50,000 of taxpayers' money, we shall ensure that we get value for money. We shall not believe irresponsibly. Touche Ross decided to help the Government. Its report gave figures for the four options to be published. It said that the cost for the 24 option, the nearest to the one selected, would be £226 million over five years. Later, the report gave a figure of savings of £120 million, virtually for ever. It may all be the stuff of fairy stories, or horror stories, but how can such nonsense be accepted as a positive response to a £50,000 investment by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The saga went from bad to worse. In July 1993, in the document "Shaping the Future—The New Councils", the Secretary of State began to unravel the farce. The document mentions the implications of the Touche Ross report, stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While these estimates … will no doubt feature in an ongoing debate on costs, there is now widespread acceptance of the fact that a single-tier structure of local government has the potential to yield significant saving in terms of costs."</p></blockquote>
Let us not worry about the semantics of the word "potential". The Secretary of State said that there was a consensus that a single-tier structure would save costs. But there is no consensus. It is just another vacuous statement that ignores reality. The Secretary of State continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's reasons for undertaking this reform are, of course, more wide-ranging than the single issue of costs."</p></blockquote>
We know what those other considerations beyond costs are. The Secretary of State went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These savings will arise because fewer managers will be needed than in the present structure."</p></blockquote>
That is the one reason the document gives for saving £200 million. Can anyone believe such nonsense? I do not see anyone on the Government Benches getting animated about the Touche Ross report. Perhaps Conservative Members want to forget about it. I sincerely hope that no public finance will be wasted simply to get local authorities into this sort of tangle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there are the financial effects of the Bill as the memorandum outlines them. Not content with suggesting that the cost will be £196 million—with either £22 million or £66 million recouped each year—a suggested saving of £1 billion—the Secretary of State tells us that we shall begin to save on 6 April 1996. That is the date the councils take over. How can anyone claim that £50 million will be saved in the first year of reorganisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout, the Government's willing allies, the consultants, have given them what they want to hear, but now all that mythology has been blown away by the report from the COSLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the COSLA report. I am wondering who prepared it, and whether the hon. Gentleman does not think that COSLA has a slight vested interest as it represents local government employees who will not be over-keen to see themselves rationalised and their number reduced. I imagine that there would be savings on day one if there were rationalisation, and a reduction in numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, COSLA is being attacked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not being attacked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is. The document was prepared by COSLA officials; it is not a political document. It is a most comprehensive paper. [
	<i>Laughter</i>]. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Robertson) laughs, but he was laughing for two-and-a-half hours this morning, so what is new?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is a comprehensive critique of the Government's proposals. It considers the English and Welsh positions, and every report that has been prepared since then. It is an authoritative report, and I welcome the fact that it is being given to English members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can anyone take seriously the poverty of thought that has gone into the process? COSLA has set out clear indications of the enormity of the financial consequences of this reorganisation Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may wish simply to brush aside the findings, as his hon. Friends have done. Our hope was that he would take the matter seriously, because COSLA's first point was that no savings would be made. This is a fundamental point, because it contradicts the Secretary of State's initial concern that, while costs were not overriding, he wanted a structure that would save the taxpayers money. Will the Minister attack the no-savings approach of COSLA? If he does attack it, will he justify the statements made in his own document?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA argues that the cost could be anything between £350 million and £750 million, as against the figures of £120 million and £196 million quoted by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, will the hon. Gentleman confirm that COSLA and whoever wrote the report cannot be described as disinterested? In fact, they must have a direct interest. If the hon. Gentleman admits that that is so, does he not think that it is just possible that the report has—quite properly—been presented in their interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do not the Government pick holes in the methodology and the argument? Why do they just want to throw disdain on COSLA as an organisation? Are they afraid of studying the report? Are they afraid of giving the Bill a moratorium? Why do not we stop wasting our time in this place and suggest that we actually look at the real cost of this total fiasco? Are any English Conservative members of the Committee willing to argue that Scots should see £700 million of scarce resources spent on a reorganisation that nobody wants, at the same time as seeing the Budget ravaged by the economic incompetence of their own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Government over 14 years? It would take an extremely brave English Conservative member of the Committee to justify that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no savings in the proposed document. The bill for the reorganisation will probably be £¾ billion. None of the expenditure will be on any improvement in services. Opposition Members could be persuaded, if there was any intention of the extra cost being linked to putting an extra policeman on the beat, because of record crime under the Tories, or an extra house in some areas of Scotland, where homelessness is rampant under the Tories—and where not a single extra teacher will go to the schools because they are being starved of resources. The cost is not about such improvements; the cost is to shift boundaries on maps, and, into the bargain, to provide the most expensive vote-rigging exercise in Scotland's history by gerrymandering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that, at this stage of the Bill, it is impossible to predict the total costs and total savings? Until the shadow structure is set up, the manning requirements and the savings will not be known. Whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not, COSLA is bound to take a biased view. The hon. Gentleman is trying to argue that the Government is taking a biased view, but at least they used independent consultants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bungling into a bigger mess. We are simply asking the Government to take COSLA's document seriously. Why cast aspersions on the credibility of the organisation? The Government should study the document because it looks at experience, including information technology, which the Government have largely ignored. COSLA has taken a professional approach to prove that the reorganisation will be extremely expensive. It is incumbent on Conservative Members to take some of the details seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks us to take COSLA seriously and accept its figure because it is the most accurate one. Why should we believe COSLA any more than the hon. Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke), who used to be the hon. Gentleman's boss? In a Grampian television interview he said that the cost would be about £126 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is early evening and some hon. Members are not listening. All we are asking is that the report be taken on board, proceedings be stopped because of the Bill's serious implications, and the costs be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important difference between Touche Ross and COSLA is that COSLA was not working to a narrow, politicised brief given by Scottish Office Ministers. The comprehensive elements of the COSLA report are worthy of examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. Instead of bobbing up and down in their seats, Conservative Members should think about the COSLA report's details. Instead of casting aspertions on the report's authors, they should get down to serious consideration. [
	<i>Interruption</i>] I want to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed the facts that no services will benefit and that if the Treasury does not provide underwriting—it will not—there will be a massive hike for
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
council tax payers or a massive destruction of services. There is another consideration not costed in the Bill—the creation of more quangos, which will flow from the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the cost of three super water qaungos been included in the Bill? They will be hand picked, with Tory placemen and placewomen to run Scotland's excellent water service. Has the cost been examined? What details of the quangos' operation have been gone into? Have the Government examined information technology in detail? What about manpower savings? We hear that calculations cannot be made for the cost of manpower because they are too difficult, but the Bill's explanatory and financial memorandum deals with the shedding of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach to cost is riddled with inaccuries and inconsistencies, but they will not own up to the fact that there are organisations better suited to commenting on finance than anyone in the Scottish Office and certainly anyone at Conservative party headquarters. As we heard this morning, it received an early copy of the brief so it may have been able to make a better job of cost assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two conflicting views about the cost of local government reorganisation. The Opposition are asking the Government if they are willing to carry on ignoring reality because they are so contemptuous of Scottish professional institutions and so confident of their ability that they are unwilling to acknowledge that Scots will be further taxed to pay for a fiasco. That is our serious challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill's purpose is to save money for Scottish taxpayers. That is what the Government have set out to do. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that COSLA has been against the reorganisation from day one and is therefore unwilling to present members of the Committee with a set of figures that will demonstrate anything other than the fact that costs will not be cut dramatically? Will he also accept that the Committee has had the report only since this morning? He may have been given a copy early, but some hon. Members have not had the opportunity to come to grips with the figures. They have to be called into question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we have it all. Conservative Members have been irritated and climbing to their feet. No matter what copy COSLA produces, the Government—so contemptous of councillors and the public, whom COSLA represents—are willing to dismiss it. The real challenge is for people such as the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South to examine the report, pick holes in it, attack the methodology, attack the Welsh and the English experiences and examine information technology, staffing implications and the shadow authorities. Conservative Members are not willing to do that. It must be evident to the Committee that they are simply not interested. The closed minds of this cosy, Conservative clique are ignoring public opinion in favour of organisations and institutions that reflect their point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to use the word rabble, but I agree with him that we should be able to hear what each hon. Member has to say. That is the purpose of debate. I urge hon. Gentlemen not to engage in conversation or to make sedentary remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point about the real purpose of the Bill. The total cost of the measure revolves around the gerrymandering of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. You will have noticed that behind the Labour Front-Bench spokesman there was a discussion immediately after you had advised us not to encourage in such conservations. That shows that the Opposition took no interest whatever in what you had to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his assistance but so far I have noticed nothing that is out of order. I shall, however, keep an eye on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am impressed with your chairmanship, Sir James. I am sure that you do not need the assistance of the hon. Member for Tayside, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is the cost of this measure to support gerrymandering. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South shakes his head. I do not care whether he likes what we are saying; this is the most expensive-ever vote-rigging exercise in Scotland: £720 million may be used to gerrymander the boundaries of a few councils in the hope that Conservatives may win at the ballot boxes of the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be ungenerous, but as a tax payer in Scotland, I resent my council taxes footing the bill for such a shameless political exercise. Have English members of the Committee seen anything to match the scale of the intrigue that the Bill unfolds daily? It is not just the £720 million; we must consider, too, the £330 million that the Government are stealing from Scottish local authorities to reduce the £50 billion deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a £1 billion time bomb, ticking away; it is a serious issue of public finance. We are constantly lectured by the party of sound money—the party of the £50 billion deficit. In April this year, Scots will face an extra £12.50—the equivalent of 7p in the pound income tax—to pay for the mess created by the Conservative Government. But what Scots will not tolerate is being asked to pay a special tax—the gerrymander tax—to allow the Government and their cronies in Scotland to change local government boundaries in an effort to secure political advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is anxious about the council tax bills and the supposed £12.50 on everyone's tax. When he next visits Dundee, will the hon. Gentleman go to the Labour group controlling the district council and tell them that their figures are rubbish, because they predicted much higher council tax bills as a result of my right hon. Friend's proposals? Council tax bills of £14—assuming that I accept the hon. Gentleman's figure of £12.50—will mean that they increased by £1.50 after reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the £12.50 is a weekly increase to pay for national insurance increases, changes in tax allowances and VAT on fuel. That is before anything else happens—it is the legacy of 14 years of Government incompetence in which the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South shared. My point is that council tax payers will have to foot the bill for this new mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To set the record straight on Dundee, I have before me a report from officials in Dundee estimating that the impact of the changes there will put £99 on the council tax in Dundee in a single year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he appreciates more than most people what is happening in local government in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot escape the view of the Scottish people it is gaining currency every day—that the reorganisation is all about the Conservative party and not about them. I hope that some English hon. Members appreciate that they will be adding insult to injury in Scotland if they force through this measure against a background of hostility and then ask Scots to pick up the bill. We know that there will be no savings. No reorganisation in the post-war period has made savings. Why should this reorganisation be any different? How can the Minister justify the background to the documents prepared by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if no savings are made, £200 million of transitional costs will be incurred. Whether it is £200 million or £720 million, it is £200 million or £720 million too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that, along the Corridor, a debate is being held on the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Bill, the purpose of which is to take thousands of people off sickness benefit and invalidity benefit. The express purpose of that Bill is to save £1.5 billion. If COSLA's figures are correct—I believe that they are—one set of Tories at one end of the Corridor are trying to save £1.5 billion, while another lot are trying to spend half of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention illustrates the hypocrisy of Members of the Conservative party isolated in Scotland, who are hoping that the Treasury and their other hon. Friends will not catch up with them. We will not allow that to happen, because it is critical for the Treasury to appreciate that the wool has been pulled over its eyes by the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the Minister was having a meeting with the Chancellor, who was swilling a pint of beer, and the Minister said, "Well, Chancellor, I'm sorry but I have a little headache. Local government reorganisation is not going to save any money, it is not going to cost £200 million, it is actually going to cost £0.75 billion." I wonder what the Chancellor's reaction would be, especially as the Government are trying to save money elsewhere, as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) said. These spendthrift and irresponsible Ministers want to feather the Conservative party's nest at the expense of services and jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that the figures that the Government have produced and will stand by have not been checked with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
Treasury? It is not possible for any Department to produce figures in a financial memorandum without Ministers and officials in the Treasury going through them with the proverbial fine-toothed comb. That is what they are there for. If the hon. Gentleman believes otherwise, he is living in a dream-world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Minister who has taken leave of his senses, not the Opposition. I do not believe for a minute that the Treasury is aware of the implications of the COSLA report, which gives the true cost of this political adventure. If the Secretary of State wants to be challenged on the financial memorandum specifically—which we hope the Treasury has checked—will he provide the Committee with a copy of any submissions that support the level of overall, on-going savings and transitional costs outlined in it? Is he willing to give me an assurance today that he can produce the documents to justify and substantiate the details in the financial memorandum?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What undertakings has the Secretary of State given to the Treasury on the funding of the costs of reorganisation? Since the Touche Ross debacle, the analysis has moved on, but the Treasury has only the initial figures. The key point is that no matter what the costs are, the Treasury has said that it will not underwrite them. Who will pay for the reorganisation, regardless of the costs incurred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good case for the Government to look anew at the cost of the reorganisation. Conservative Members may be flippant about the details of the COSLA report, but Opposition Members take very seriously the burdens that have been imposed on Scottish families. Given the faltering recovery and pay restraints, Scottish families do not want to pay any more for this reckless and irresponsible reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge is for the Government to tackle the issues in the COSLA report. More importantly, there should be a moratorium on the Bill's proceedings until we can obtain conclusive evidence that the reorganisation will save money and not, as we suspect, impose more burdens on every Scottish family the length and breadth of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard what might be described as a typical rant from the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). I am glad that he has at least conceded that the figures from Fife regional council about the reorganisation in that part of the country are broadly correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the paradoxes of the hon. Gentleman's approach is that the Labour party was committed in its manifesto to a single-tier system in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After a Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. However, the hon. Gentleman is presumably not arguing that a Scottish Parliament would be a cost-free exercise. I refer him to the recent statement by the shadow Chancellor that there are no spending commitments. There is no commitment to a Scottish Parliament then, is there? Or is the Labour party saying that a Scottish Parliament can be set up in Edinburgh at no cost? If that is the Labour party's position, we have made the most enormous advance in the constitutional debate and the debate on costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about Strathclyde, and said that its circumstances were different from those of Fife. Indeed they are, but I take it that his commitment to a unitary system does not mean that under such a system in
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Scotland, Strathclyde would be the unitary authority for the whole of the west of Scotland. If that is the Labour party's position on costs, let us hear it loud and clear. It will not go down particularly well in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson). As a most meticulous constituency Member, he will naturally have read the submission to the Scottish Office from Hamilton and East Kilbride district councils, both Labour-controlled bodies. They said that compared with the present two-tier structure in Strathclyde, a unitary authority based on East Kilbride and Hamilton—the Government's proposal is for a rather larger body, but the bulk will be made up by East Kilbride and Hamilton—would, over 15 years, save £51 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Member for Hamilton to endorse those figures, produced by his own Labour colleagues in his own constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much is being made of associating Conservative and Opposition Members with their local authorities. Why, only a few weeks ago, did the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) distance himself so rapidly and completely from the activities of Westminster city council? Why did the Secretary of State for the Environment make it clear in the statement on Westminster city council that he held the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) no more responsible for the activities of Blackburn council than he did his right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South for the activities of Westminster city council? Why must we always take responsibility for local authorities just because they happen to be within our constituency boundaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be getting rather edgy. Let me advise him that Westminster city council is unaffected by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill. I do not suggest that the hon. Gentleman should automatically endorse the position of his local district council, but it would interest the Committee to know his views. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is entitled to disagree with the figures from Dundee city council which showed savings over 15 years of £30 million as against transitional costs of £6 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how the Minister can assume that I disagree with Dundee district council. I have a report from the council which predicts that as a result of these changes, it will suffer a net loss in grant income of more than £2 million every year. It foresees job losses, a reduction in services and much poorer services for people living in Dundee as a result of these policies. The council is opposed to them, as is Tayside regional council and every other elected body in that area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an assumption on grant distribution. The submission that we received from Dundee district council on the costs of running a single-tier system, as against the present two-tier system, contains the figures I gave the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central, in his rant, said that it was quite wrong that the Government should not take the figures produced by COSLA seriously. I notice that the hon. Gentleman did not respond when asked whether he had received an advance copy of the submission from non-political organisation COSLA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I am not given to raising points of order but this is an extremely important one relating to an answer given by the Secretary of State for the Environment to a written question this afternoon. It has implications for the conduct of the Committee. Replying to a question from the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland) on the local government review in England and Wales and the high court judgment on the Lancashire challenge, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government believe that unitary authorities will often be the best way of achieving these objectives. In those cases they will be able to reduce costs and improve the quality and co-ordination of services … Decisions will be taken on commission recommendations in that light. However, there is no national blueprint and the Government do not rule out consideration of two tiers in particular circumstances, with or without changes to the status quo, where a strong case for that is made."</p></blockquote>
The current local government review in the United Kingdom has been subject to a major policy change by the Government. Surely in the light of that, there is a case for the Minister to move to adjourn the Committee so that the full implications of the Government's U-turn can be examined. We could then find out whether the Government now wish to take the Bill back to the drawing board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. The hon. Gentleman will no doubt mention it in the debate. Everything so far has been in order—apart from roaming down to Westminster from Scodand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman refers to is clearly not a policy U-turn as he alleges. Secondly, it has nothing to do with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Can you advise the Committee about the implications of a legal challenge in Scotland, given the nature of the Bill and the way in which the Government have retreated from the idea of imposing unitary authorities in England and Wales, but still intend to force them through in Scotland even though there is no consensus and has been no review? If there were a legal challenge in the Scottish courts, would the Committee have to stop its deliberations to allow the Government to take another view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that that is not a matter for the Chair. The Chair does not offer such advice. The House would have to deal with the hypothetical case suggested by the hon. Gentleman when the time comes, if it ever comes. The House has asked us to consider the Bill and that is what the Committee is doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly trying to delay my response to the COSLA report to which Opposition Members are so keen to have an immediate Government reply. If he is going to speak on a matter that is related to amendment No. 3, I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the matter is relevant to our debate. The reply of the Secretary of State for the Environment this afternoon to one of his hon. Friends makes clear the argument for unitary authorities in England and Wales. He says that they will be

	<br><blockquote><p>"able to reduce costs and improve the quality and co-ordination of services"</p></blockquote>
There has, however, been a U-turn. The Government have already postponed for a year their proposals for Wales and the Secretary of State has now said that they will not challenge a High Court ruling for England and Wales and will abandon the basic principle of establishing unitary authorities in England. What will the Minister do? There is surely an argument for stopping the Committee at this stage, in the interests of democracy in Scotland, to ensure that we have a chance to examine what the Secretary of State has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Is not it not the case that there are many differences in law between Scotland and England? Is not it the right of the Government and of the Secretary of State for Scotland to make law in accordance with the wishes of the Scottish people? Is not the issue raised by the hon. Member for Hamilton totally irrelevant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman proves conclusively that we should get on with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a point of order during an intervention. It is a Scottish practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a curiosity unique to Scottish Bills that there are points of order during interventions. The Minister has many officials who are expert in this area. What are the implications of the Government's dramatic U-turn on England? If there is to be a court challenge in Scotland, will the Minister stop consideration of the Bill to allow the legal processes—never mind the processes of natural justice—to take place so we can examine the consistency of the Government's proposals for local government throughout the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I appeal to hon. Members to make their interventions short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the shadow Secretary of State is trying to delay our proceedings by making irrelevant points. I can, however, satisfy him. My right hon. and hon. Friends in the Welsh Office have brought the timetable for Wales into line with that for Scotland. That shows how sensible is the timetable announced originally for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the point about the parliamentary answer of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Hamilton has clearly not followed the position in England. The Government made clear when the legislation on English local government was before the House in 1992—the hon. Gentleman was then so naturally involved in foreign affairs that he had no particular interest in local government in Scotland or in England—that there was no blueprint for English reorganisation, which are exactly the words that he read out from my right hon Friend. Neither then nor subsequently have the Government ruled out a two-tier system in some English areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Hamilton will forgive me, I shall endeavour to answer the point made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I politely asked whether the hon. Gentleman had received an advance copy of the COSLA report. The information might have been useful, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
hon. Gentleman did not respond, so people can draw then-own conclusions in light of his untoward silence. Opposition Members criticise the fact that my hon. Friends say that COSLA is a political organisation. Of course it is. There is nothing wrong with that, because it is led by politicians—councillors of all political hues and none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister said. Does he make the same assessment of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. Is CIPFA a political organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has recognised that there is nothing inaccurate or pejorative in describing COSLA as a political organisation. CIPFA is not led by elected politicians. During the debate, I hope to answer some of the points made by CIPFA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get on to the COSLA document, but I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I know, the report has not been before a COSLA committee of councillors or other elected members. It is an official's report. Will the Minister say whether his professional advisers have challenged the methodology used in the Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte analysis of the costs of the White Paper proposals for Lothian—and the COSLA report, released today, on the costs of reorganisation throughout Scotland. It is unreasonable to ask the Minister to answer now on the COSLA report. I believe that he could answer on the Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte report. If his professional advisers wish to challenge the COSLA report, could they do so before next Tuesday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The methodology in a range of reports has been broadly similar, but not identical. I shall make some preliminary comments about the COSLA report. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) reasonably said that I cannot be expected to give a full critique of the report, which I did not receive until mid-morning today. It was not sent to the Scottish Office. COSLA does not send documents on local government reform to us because of its policy of non-co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have suggested, the timing is extremely curious. The Touche Ross report, to which the hon. Member for Fife, Central referred, was published in October 1992—about 15 months ago. The White Paper with its analysis and costs was published six months ago. Now, by a most remarkable coincidence, COSLA springs its report out of the blue on the day when the subject is to be discussed by the Committee. Conservative Members would not have received it until mid-morning and would not have been able to read it in detail and, therefore, respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a good point. I remind him that the issue was due to be debated last Tuesday. I wonder whether COSLA missed out on the fact that the document presumably was not available on Tuesday. The hon. Member for Fife, Central might be able to clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not suggest that COSLA was involved in a conspiracy with the Scottish National party to delay our debate on Tuesday. If COSLA assumed that Tuesday's debate would go ahead, we would have still been
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
debating the matter at 10.30 this morning. None of us would have had the COSLA report—except for Opposition Members if, indeed, they had advance notice of it. I make no allegation, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall describe what a preliminary glance at the COSLA report revealed. I assure the hon. Member for Fife, Central that we shall consider it carefully. He assumed that we would not look seriously at the report; I assure him that we will—as we have done at other evidence that has been put to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read the report, and I met the delegation from Central region that was led by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help the Minister out? He seems to be going astray.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is was asking whether we read the Pieda report, the answer is yes. No doubt we shall consider such arguments in more detail when we discuss schedule 1, but I was about to say that there is not unanimity of view in Central region. As the hon. Gentleman knows I also met a delegation from Clackmannan district council. That Labour-led council had a different view of the appropriate future and costs of a different form of organisation for that area.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we go again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be struggling. We are in Committee and it is possible for him to speak two or three times. Would not it is be better for him to stop now and allow one or two other hon. Members to contribute? We can talk a little about the COSLA report, the comments of CIPFA and other aspects of the matter. The Minister might then be able to deal with the subject more comprehensively later. At the moment his speech is proceeding rather erratically and he is not really focusing on some of the essential points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been responding to interventions from Labour Members, including a long and completely irrelevant intervention from the hon. Member for Hamilton. It would be reasonable for me to give an initial reaction to some aspects of the COSLA report. As the hon. Member for Linlithgow reasonably argued, that reaction cannot constitute a final response to a report that I did not receive until mid-morning. I hope to be able to catch your eye later in the debate, Sir James, to respond to points that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will no doubt make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COSLA report suggests that the Government underestimate the wind-up costs. I note from the report a suggested figure of £90 million for the cost of winding up the new councils. That is a welcome reduction from unrealistic estimates made by other bodies, notably CIPFA and Strathclyde, of between £200 million and £250 million. I still consider the estimate too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may find it helpful to examine some of the financial estimates provided by Scottish local authorities. The hon. Member for Linlithgow referred to Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte—a highly respected firm of consultants, as he said. That firm suggested that the cost of winding up the affairs of local authorities in the highland area might amount to no more than £2.5 million. For those in the Fife area it might be no more than £1.1 million. Neither estimate fits comfortably with the figure of £90 million put forward by COSLA. They fit far more comfortably with the estimate of between £25 million and £40 million that the Government have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also give my initial reaction to arguments about staff numbers. As I have said in the past, the number of staff affected by the reorganisation will be a matter for the new councils. The range of between 700 and 2,200 individuals suggested in the White Paper was based on the Government's careful analysis. At first glance, the figures put forward by COSLA of between 1,900 and 3,500—a higher range—seem surprisingly high, as there are only about 30,000 senior and middle managers and specialists in Scottish local government. Is COSLA really saying that 10 per cent. of those staff will no longer be required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An explanation for that figure—a point referred to by the hon. Member for Fife, Central—may be that COSLA based its estimate on what happened when a few English councils were abolished in the 1980s. For several reasons, however, those events are not necessarily comparable. The Scottish reorganisation will take place in a different context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
I note with interest what the report says about the cost of redundancy and retirement. COSLA estimates that it will cost between £200 million and £380 million. I have not been able to examine the figures in detail, but they suggest that redundancy and compensation payments will be an average of more than £100,000 per person. Is COSLA suggesting that those leaving local government as a result of reorganisation—they will be at many levels of responsibility—will be entitled to £100,000 or more each?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If £100,000 is apparently too much, what is the Government's estimate of a person's entitlement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our estimate is considerably below that. We believe that between 700 and 2,200 people will be involved and that the total cost will be between £42 million and £83 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Angus, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a sterile exercise for the Minister to attack COSLA's figures and for COSLA to attack the Minister's figures. Could both sides say on what assumptions the figures are based? It would be better for the Minister, COSLA and CIPFA to discuss the matter and let the experts get to the truth. It is important for the structure of the new system that its finances should be accurately known. Is the Minister prepared to work with the experts to thrash out the truth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We offered to discuss costs with COSLA, but COSLA broke off the discussions. We were happy to continue to discuss the costs of reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be accused of filibustering if I do. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but then I must get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between the Minister choosing to respond to genuine points raised by Opposition Members to help the discussion along and the Minister giving long, circuitous answers to the non-questions asked by some Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have a professional qualification in finance. I find myself floundering when considering some of these detailed financial questions. Like other hon. Members, I received the COSLA report only this morning. COSLA has a policy of non-co-operation, but I understand that the same does not apply to CIPFA. Allegations have been made that COSLA is politically biased, but the Minister accepts that CIPFA is not. It would help if CIPFA and the Scottish Office spoke to each other so that some of the figures could be confirmed, such as those on redundancy. I accept that methodological differences may account for some variations. I am making a positive point, not simply trying to waste the Committee's time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman is making a positive point. As I said, we have been available to discuss financial estimates with a range of organisations if they wished to discuss such matters with us. I was asked whether that applied to COSLA. I said that it did, but that COSLA had broken off the discussions because of its policy of non-co-operation.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must get on. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are prefectly prepared to discuss the CIPFA report with any organisation that wishes to discuss it. I hope to refer in this debate to some of the matters contained in the CIPFA report, which will be of benefit to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, I know that he is a charitable man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Davidson), was that CIPFA is a reputable institution which has escaped the aspersions cast on other organisations. It has key expertise on finance. Will the Minster say today that he will invite CIPFA to discuss in detail with the Scottish Office the COSLA report as it relates to the costs included in the financial memorandum? The objective is to build consensus. Will the Minister respond positively to the comments made a few minutes ago by my hon. Friend the Member for Govan?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have responded positively. I said that we are perfectly willing to discuss the costs of reorganisation with COSLA. If CIPFA considers that it would be helpful to hold a technical meeting to discuss its report, we should be happy to do so. The hon. Member for Fife, Central referred to the CIPFA critique, so perhaps it would be appropriate for me to refer to that report also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CIPFA asserts that retirement and redundancy costs are severely underestimated. That statement seems to be based on several rather questionable assumptions. The first is that the Government should be including in the necessary costs of reorganisation the cost of allowing any staff over the age of 50 to retire if they so wish. That is not an acceptable methodology. I am sure that if the terms were right, there could be significant numbers of people over 50 wishing to take early retirement. That does not mean, however, that they should have an automatic right to do so. It will be for authorities to manage early retirements so as to allow early retirement only to such staff as will not be required under the new structure. In other words, the Government's figures have recognised that early retirement will form part of the overall costs package but they do not assume indiscriminate early retirement. That was made clear in last year's White Paper, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there may indeed be local government staff who wish to take the opportunity of reform to leave local government and do not wish to be offered a new post, but this should not be considered as a necessary consequence of reform if it results in the new council finding itself short of staff. Rather it is an extension of a normal personnel issue—whether it is cost-effective for an employer to agree to an employee taking early retirement".</p></blockquote>
The other principal reason which CIPFA has put forward for claiming that retirement and redundancy costs are underestimated seems to stem from a comparison with redundancy costs arising from the break-up of the Manchester metropolitan counctil. That is a crucial point, but the comparison assumes that that exercise and the Scottish reorganisation are similar exercises. Self-evidently, however, they are not, not least because the metropolitan counties were abolished and their functions transferred to existing authorities. In Scotland we shall, in most cases, be creating wholly new authorities. That is reflected in the figures. It is interesting to note that redundancy—retirement costs arising from using the Manchester model are between £125 million and £200 million—that is the CIPFA figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic of that escapes me. The situation in which authorities are being abolished is certainly different from that in which staff are transferred to new authorities. Surely transferring staff to newly created authorities must be more expensive. The Minister criticises the use of models from England and Wales, such as the metropolitan counties, but that experience should be tapped into in order to estimate costs. On what experience is the Secretary of State and the Scottish Office drawing to produce more realistic impressions of what might be involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have made it clear that while it is of course relevant to consider models from experience elsewhere, we cannot automatically apply the Manchester model to Scotland. The CIPFA estimate of costs is between £125 million and £200 million. That compares with the Government estimate of between £21 million and £65 million. So CIPFA suggests that following reorganisation, local government staffing levels would be reduced by as much as 10 times the amount suggested by the Government. If that were true, the ongoing savings from such a slim staffing structure would be enormous, and much higher than the Government's estimate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister be prepared to place in the Library the basis of the thinking that produces figures that range from £21 million to £65 million? Before Tuesday—or Thursday, at the Minister's convenience—we should like to read some of the background work on which the figures are based. Forgive us, we are sceptical. Supposing that the Government figures are correct, this would not be new money, would it? It would come from existing Scottish Office allocations. That means that services will be reduced to the value of £21 million, £65 million or, as some of us suspect, a great deal more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis of the estimate is in the White Paper, to which I refer the hon. Gentleman. If he wishes to ask further questions once he has considered the White Paper, I should be happy to respond. It is generally accepted that immediate transitional costs—the Government have never sought to deny this—arise from moving to a new structure, notably redundancy costs. We have argued that there will be substantial ongoing savings. That principle is not significantly under dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to him on the basis that he will not seek to interrupt this speech—at least—any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being generous, but I will not wish my life away by promising him that I will not intervene again. The weighing of transitional costs, which will mainly impact during the next three years, against notional and fanciful savings over the next 15 years, does not affect the point about the Treasury. The Treasury works on a three-year public expenditure programme and a one-year fixed programme. My hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
for Linlithgow's point is that the transitional costs will not be underwritten at all by the Treasury. We can forget about savings, the transitional costs will be a burden to be paid for out of jobs and services. How does the Minister square that circle? There will be no new money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circle has been squared. In his public expenditure statement, the Secretary of State made absolutely clear what the figures for transitional costs over the next three years would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who will pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that that will come out of the Scottish Office budget. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman thinks that there is any doubt about that. The figure of £5 million for next year unquestionably comes out of the Scottish Office budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will that impact on services? The money must come from somewhere, so that must lead to a decrease in the provision of services. Is the Minister aware of the recent news from Scottish Nuclear Ltd which said that, because of cash flow problems, it is likely to go bust in the next financial year? If that is so, resources will be taken from the Scottish Office budget. Cash will be directed from elsewhere and further pressure will be placed on social work, roads and other services. There are other pressures on the Minister's budget anyhow, which can only be reflected in fewer services under the new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the Secretary of State must take difficult decisions between different expenditure heads. Those decisions will be taken against the background of the substantial resources available in Scotland and the fact that expenditure per head in local government in Scotland is substantially higher than expenditure per head in England or Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to what has happened to the issue of cost. Following the publication of the Touche Ross report, there was much instant and ill-informed comment. We heard memorable guesses from the Labour party. One week it said that reorganisation would cost £400 million; the next week it said it would cost £500 million; the following week it said £600 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many reports from consultants and councils have been produced and reference has been made to some of them. There is a clear difference between those reports that have suggested that the Government have underestimated the cost and those individual reports, usually, but not exclusively, from Labour-led authorities that consider their own areas and reflect a very different picture. The consultants and councils that have considered the implications of structures in different parts of Scotland have come up with a picture that is very different from that painted by the hon. Member for Fife, Central. I shall, of course, refer to costs and savings as we consider the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to catch your eye later, Sir James, in order to respond to the points that will have been made. At this stage, my aim is to give a preliminary view in response to the Opposition and to some of the points that they wish to raise about the COSLA report. I wish to make it clear that the wild assertions of the hon. Member for Fife, Central are simply not borne out by a whole range of submissions from Labour-led councils in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am about to conclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over time, we have fully considered many reports. I welcome one point in the COSLA report, which was reflected in the speech of the hon. Member for Fife, Central. He said that it was sensible and only proper to consider a range of figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member --> 
	<i>indicated assent.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees because that is contrary to what the hon. Member for Hamilton has said in the past, when he has challenged the Government to produce an estimate to the last pound. That is unrealistic for the good reason that much will depend on the individual decisions taken by individual local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, of course we shall examine the COSLA report and be able to respond in greater detail to it. However, even after a preliminary reading, I do not believe that its overall conclusions are correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir James, for the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Bill and especially on the amendment. It is now nearly 10 years since I participated in a debate in Committee on a Scottish local government Bill or indeed in any other Scottish Standing Committee debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that the hon. Member for Tayside, North was a regular attender. I think that he and I were on all the Committees considering Scottish Bills and all the Committees considering aviation Bills in the 1979–83 Parliament. I am glad that he is fit and well and that we can continue the discussion. As the hon. Gentleman will remember, the Minister who dealt with Bills at that time was the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). He dealt with them with a greater dispatch and with greater forensic skills than the Minister does. He was rewarded by being moved from the Scottish Office, ultimately to much higher things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister has been dealing with matters in a rather general way, although he did make some specific points. I understand that he has a problem because he only saw the report this morning, but it would be better if he had considered the matter, because COSLA has put forward a serious critique. It contains the CIPFA comments, with which I want to deal briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some bandying about across the Committee of comments such as "We support the Touche Ross report" and "Oh no, the COSLA report is better." There is a sort of political tennis match in Committee. I shall not indulge in that. I just have a gut feeling that consultants who are not necessarily experienced in local government and who are paid substantial sums to produce a report for the Government are much more likely to come up with the answer that the Government want. That is fairly self-evident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. It is just like old times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will accept, I hope, that he has just said that Touche Ross cannot be regarded as completely impartial. Therefore, will he accept that anyone reporting on behalf of other vested interests cannot claim to be impartial either?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is as courteous as usual in putting his question and his question is valid. Of course, there is political control over COSLA as an organisation, but I have great faith in the independence of those working for COSLA, especially the finance officials, who are real professionals. I also have great faith in CIPFA, which represents professional finance officers who work day in, day out in local government which is why their critique and calculations are much more likely to be accurate. That is my opinion of the report, and I shall give the Committee one or two examples to justify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to plug on about the same point, but does the hon. Gentleman accept that an official working for COSLA—an employee of an existing local authority—who, presumably, shares the reluctance to co-operate with the local government report, has a vested interest, just as my hon. Friend suggested? [Hon. Members: "Disgraceful."] That is no more disgraceful an allegation than the suggestion by the hon. Member for Fife, Central that Touche Ross had a vested interest. Employees of COSLA do have a vested interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer, but the hon. Gentleman does not appear to be listening. With respect, I chose my words carefully. I did not say that Touche Ross had a vested interest; I said that consultants without experience of local government might be predisposed to come up with the sort of answer that their paymaster was expecting—the chap who pays the piper calls the tune. People involved in local government are no different from the civil servants present in the room, who are impartial. After the next election they will provide impartial information to my hon. Friends the Members for Fife, Central and for Hamilton, just as they provide it to the Minister now. The fact that the Minister is incapable of using it effectively is another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I base my views on personal experience.

In addition to property costs, there will be staff costs, because of the games of musical chairs that take place. People move around; they do not stay in the same jobs. One sure thing is that they move to jobs with higher salaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[
	<b>Mr. Michael J. Martin</b> 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>The unions negotiate arrangements, and it is right, understandable and legitimate that the salaries of people whose jobs may not be of a high standard should be conserved. But those who move up receive increased salaries. Such costs are predicted and guaranteed.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman now accept that the Bill contains controls to restrict excessive salary increases? We said on Second Reading that the previous reorganisation resulted in rediculous salary increases. At least increases will be controlled under this Bill. Furthermore, there should be optimum utilisation of existing property; we are going down a tier, not up a tier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there are some controls. But I predict that the number of education authorities, social work authorities and highway authorities will increase. I have more to come, so the hon. Gentleman should bide his time and keep his powder dry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider redundancies and early retirement, too. Some people will be unhappy about the reorganisation. I also predict that, because of the uncertainty and confusion about what will happen, more people will take up redundancy offers and early retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of what will happen with the elected authorities, we shall have the cost of setting up three water and sewerage boards—new quangos. No doubt members of the boards will be paid. Each of them will have offices, new computer systems, information technology services and support services. There will be directors of administration, directors of finance and directors of personnel—the new job title, I think, is directors of human resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And public relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is correct. No doubt the boards will contract out to public relations departments, too. As well as three new water and sewerage boards with a new infrastructure, we shall have separate police and fire authorities. There will be Strathclyde fire

	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
and Lothian and Borders fire—separate organisations with separate headquarters with separate directors of administration, directors of finance and directors of human resources. The expenditure needed to put that in place is predictable and guaranteed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a passionate case for the status quo for local government in Scotland. Why then is that not his party's policy? [hon Members: "It is."] Why was that not in the manifesto on which Opposition Members were elected? Their manifesto clearly supported single-tier local authorities with a Scottish Assembly. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that policy would not cost anything and that it would not create all the problems that he is outlining?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous occupant of the Chair asked for short interventions. The hon. Gentleman's intervention was excessively long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our manifesto did not favour three non-elected boards—three quangos—with a bureaucratic administrative set-up for water and sewerage facilities. Such proposals were not in our manifesto, nor would they be in our plans. Moreover, we would not have police and fire authorities separate from the local authority and with different boundaries. That is the stupidity of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to possible savings to try to offset some of that guaranteed expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he now supports the status quo. I had understood that he supported an all-Ayrshire single-tier authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to deal constantly with inept interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in Committee to examine the Bill in detail, line by line, and to deal with the amendments. We are discussing cost effectiveness and efficiency; I shall deal later with Ayrshire. The Labour party's policy is clear: we are against reorganisation until a Scottish Assembly has been set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way. Sit down!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee should settle down, and hon. Members should let their tempers cool a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very cool, Mr. Martin. It is just that Conservative Members keep rising, expecting to intervene. Unfortunately, the Opposition have become used to their arrogance, but we shall not bow down to it. Certainly, I will not. A Conservative Member asks a question and, when one is halfway through answering it, his hon. Friends are on their feet again like jacks-in-the-boxes. One would think that they were paid for interventions and that Scottish Power gives them more money each time they intervene to ask questions of Labour Members. Perhaps they should get an extra car, free health insurance or something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to finish dealing with the previous intervention. Our policy is clear—we do not want reorganisation now because we do not have a Scottish Assembly. The Bill has had its Second Reading, the principle has been accepted by Parliament, and it is open to us to study it in detail. The Minister understands such procedure; he has experienced it
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
before, unlike some newer hon. Members. We can discuss the Bill bit by bit, clause by clause, line by line and consider the various options. The hon. Member for Tayside, North also has experience of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted, I was outlining all the certain expenditure of which we know and the escalating cost. I now refer to the savings. Earlier, the Minister answered one of my questions and his reply was precise and helpful. He said that the CIPFA is not a political body and that it consisted of professional finance officers and others. The CIPFA report is annexed in yellow at the back of the COSLA report. It lists many matters item by item, but I shall mention only one or two. For example, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The (costs)/savings identified by Touche Ross represent a very small percentage of the total local government expenditure and CIPFA believes, for the reasons outlined, that the potential savings have been overstated and the costs understated."</p></blockquote>
The position could not be stated more clearly than that. The report gives two extremely salutary examples. On the finance function, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"CIPFA does not accept that this level of saving in finance staff could be achieved except by a serious reduction in the provision of financial management and advice."</p></blockquote>
Tellingly, in the light of what has happened elsewhere, the report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The custody of public funds requires a high level of financial control and the Institute is concerned that the reduction in finance staff numbers envisaged in this report would seriously undermine the current high quality of financial control in Scottish local authorities."</p></blockquote>
I do not want events of the sort that have occurred in Westminster to happen in Scottish local authorities, so we need to maintain that high level of financial control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Few Conservative Members would disagree that we must maintain high levels of financial control, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to mislead the Committee by suggesting that there have never been occasions in Scotland when financial control has not been exercised as it should. There was an instance of that in the Western Isles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and the Western Isles example is one that we would not want repeated. I refer to the investment in the Bank of Commerce and Credit International. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the last thing that we want is to reduce the number of staff in financial control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is that of libraries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it is an extremely good one. I am not attacking Touche Ross de facto, but it does not know as much about what goes on in local authorities as the people who work in them know. The CIPFA report—I hope that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South will listen to what it says, as he might eventually learn something—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems unusual, therefore, that an increase of 11 library authorities to 51 will produce savings of 34–8 per cent."</p></blockquote>
That is a very good point. If the number of library authorities is increased, presumably there will be an increase in the number of district librarians and personal assistants to district librarians. How, then, can the precise figure of 34–8 per cent. be saved? That is illogical. One does not need a BSc or a PhD—some local authority figures assume degrees that they are not entitled to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not members of CIPFA, are they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they are not members of CIPFA. One does not need a degree to work it out. How has that amazingly accurate figure of 34–8 per cent. been calculated? It is crazy. Unless it is planned to get rid of an enormous number of books, or to stop buying them, it does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I picked out two categories—financial control and libraries—but there are many more. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central and my hon. Friend the Member for Govan, who defeated for the second time someone who I enjoyed defeating in 1979, made important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many more categories in which there is detailed questioning of the Touche Ross report by COSLA and CIPFA, and I hope that the Secretary of State will initiate discussions on the issue. It is wrong for the financial effects of the Bill to be grossly understated. That is not a political point; it misleads us and the public if we get it wrong. I hope that officials will be asked to sort it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs will be much greater than the Government envisage. Savings are more ethereal and less tangible than costs and thus more difficult to predict, and they should be treated with caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment mentions economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It is about delivering services and ensuring that we have authorities of an appropriate size and structure to deliver education and other services effectively. We are concerned not with councillors and officials but with people who receive those services, particularly special education and facilities for mentally handicapped people, children and the elderly who depend on social services. That is what we mean by economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has my warm support and I hope that the Minister will give it a thoughtful reply and keener analysis than he did in his introduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might surprise the hon. Gentleman that I find the terminology in the amendment interesting. I am keen to ensure economy. If I could be certain that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends would join me in ensuring that there were substantial economies on manpower levels and other matters that are the real revenue cost for local authorities, and that the amendment would ensure that economies could be made, I could be tempted by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also deals with "efficiency". I am tempted by the use of that word if it means that in each clause, the Committee would examine the combination of economy—that is, manpower levels and the type of people employed as well as quality and cost—and increasing efficiency. That would be interesting and worth pursuing. However, I do not want to become involved in interesting but academic debate about which report is nearer the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a fairly long life, I have learnt always to be suspicious of financial reports. In every boardroom that I have sat in, I have examined such reports in detail. I examine the literature that comes from the European Union and I have dealt with the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty in the same way. I have had a copy of the COSLA report for a relatively short time, but I have already found in it interesting matters that I shall want explained in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
Rarely are financial projections correct in practice. There are either increased costs or possible savings. Savings will come if economy and efficiency are examined in detail. There were problems with the previous local government reorganisation because the increased size, area and scope of local authorities created a rediculous situation. The Fife authority remained exactly the same, but it was lumbered with the same people doing the same jobs at massively greater cost. Employees had to be paid according to new salary scales that were the result of new structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment addressed such matters and ensured that a similar situation did not result, I would be tempted by it. Everyone who pays council tax expects us to examine matters carefully. I also examine the issues as a taxpayer. Only a small percentage of local authorites costs is paid through council tax. Most of the cost of running Scots local authorities is borne by the taxpayer and, from the taxpayer's point of view, we want economy and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment contains the delightful words
	<br><blockquote><p>"effectiveness in th use of resources".</p></blockquote>
That phrase is lovely. It means different things to different people. What is meant by those words? Effective to whom—those who work within an organisation, those who are in receipt of services, the taxpayer or the tax payer? I wonder about the wording. I do not argue with the words "economy" and "efficiency" because they appeal to me and they are useful and could be written into legislation to encourage proper use of resources. However, what is meant by "effectiveness"? It is a little woolly and vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman support the amendment if the word "ineffectiveness", rather than the word "effectiveness" was used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might find it much more tempting. The hon. Gentleman is correct. It might seem to be an amusing, interesting little debating point, but later, when those involved in local authorities are required to work within statute law, the way in which words are used can become important. That is why the question of effectivenss in the use of resources does not appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ineffective use of resources would encourage me to think that, through economy and efficiency, one could get rid of people who were not doing their job effectively or properly in the interests of the local authority. That argument appeals to me because a great problem that we face in life is that it is extremely difficult to remove people who badly provide services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may stray a little, one of the matters that worried me about European legislation was that it was trying to build in a means whereby ineffective people could not be got rid of. We must study that problem much more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was good of COSLA to produce the report. If it had produced it a couple of weeks earlier, I should have been much happier. Reports such as the COSLA report work from models, but without access to the proper details, which can often lead to the wrong answer. In this day of modern technology, we should make use of all available equipment to arrive at different answers. I found it astonishing that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made a submission to the Boundary Commission, which has proposed an addition to my constituency, which I greatly welcome, bringing in Alloway, Doonfoot, Holmston and Forehill. When that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
happens, the commission might consider going back to the old name of south Ayrshire. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would welcome that, as I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly know where it was if it were described as south Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was on the point of saying that I found it astonishing that the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee could suggest that the report, which I promise to read carefully, is somehow holier than thou, whereas the report produced by Touche Ross and Co., is highly suspect. Anyone who has studied financial reports knows that they all have slants of some kind. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Coon Valley suggested that, simply because someone pays financial advisors to produce a report, they will produce one that the payer wants. I have news for the hon. Gentleman: I have read more reports produced by consultants that were contrary to the wishes of those who were paying than I have read supporting the wishes of those who were paying. I can give the hon. Gentleman a long list of the reports that I have had to read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often as not, one person will get an idea and be carried away with it. Consultants are then asked to study the idea and produce a financial report to give an indication of the potential cost involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the barbed quip that a consultant is someone who asks for your watch to tell you the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A consultant's report gives one guidance on what the possible outcome will be if one does certain things. I have never met an accountant of any kind who has stated to me, "This will be the final analysis," with certainty. They use phrases such as "in the region of or "something like".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a good report. From my short acquaintance with it, it appears that a good deal of effort has gone into it. However, that does not mean that it is holy writ. Its provenance does not mean that it must be the only authentic report, but the Committee is right to read and examine it and to debate its contents. That is the Committee's job. We should look at every piece of advice that comes our way and study in detail the wording of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment uses the phrases "which ensure economy". However, the Committee has not been told where such economies would come from. What is meant by "economy? The Labour Front-Bench spokesman spent a lot of time rubbishing—if I may use that word—the Touche Ross report and congratulating COSLA on its report, but the Committee was not told what the amendment means. That is the important matter, and what we are here to to discuss. I hope that I will provoke members of Labour's Front-Bench team into telling the Committee exactly what is meant by "will ensure economy". Until that is spelt out in detail, there is no way the Committee can accept the amendment, tempting though it be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to efficiency: if the hon. Member for Fife, Central had been in a boardroom and spoken the sort of rubbish to which he treated the Committee when he introduced the amendment, he would have got very short shrift. We were given some instructions this morning about probing amendments and so on, but if I am to support an
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
amendment I want its mover to describe in detail its contents, its effect and the way in which it will be implemented by the authorities that the Bill will create when it becomes statute law. That has not been done. Consequently, until a Labour Member gives those details, the Committee should reject the amendment. I am open to persuasion but I must be told exactly what is meant by the words contained in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My personal view, for what it is worth, is that longevity as a Membr of Parliament does not entitle one to claim a more worthy opinion than any other hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to a point that was made during the discussion of the money resolution. The cost of the Bill may be greater than what can be measured in purely monetary terms. That greater price involves the cost of destruction of officials and councillors in local authorities, and the cost of anaesthetising the whole local government system. That is not a measurable cost. The Government should have paid greater attention to the experience of Lord Campbell of Croy, who was responsible for the previous reform. He said that his whole time as Secretary of State was spoilt by the problem of local government reform. Such reforms do not end after two, three or five years. The late Willy Ross, if he were here, would bear out my contention that the problems of local government reforms spilled over into his time as Secretary of State. This proposed reform will cover many years—it is not a one-off. The costs of th anaesthetic effect on local government that this Bill represents will be huge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have promised to be succinct and I should like to put a number of specific questions to the Minister. Question 1: where is the new money to come from, or am I right in saying that there is to be no new money? Has the Treasury indicated that there will be no new money to pay for reorganisation? It would be helpful if the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) gave a response. This is a fundamental, factual question. Am I right in saying that the Treasury has said that there is no new money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered that point. The Secretary of State made the position clear in his public expenditure statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we go by what the Secretary of State says, I think that I am right in saying that there is no new money. If that is the case, which services will be reduced? If we are to be serious about debating costs, we must know which services will be reduced if no new money is available. The money for the reorganisation has to come from somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are fundamental questions, and I have put them as simply as possible. If Ministers will not answer them, terrible problems for the Committee will ensue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, may I say that I am taking a note of his questions and will endeavour to answer them later? It will not be terribly productive if he asks me a question, I respond, he asks me another question, I respond, and so on. I shall consider his questions and respond later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's response on the basis that those questions will be answered later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question two: does the Minister dispute the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy research which estimates that the annual running costs of local government for the whole of Scotland will be in the region
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
of £30 million to £40 million more? Bob Gould and others at Strathclyde say that of that figure, £27 million will be needed for the new councils of Strathclyde in the first year. Does the Scottish Office dispute that? Does the education department of the Scottish Office contradict the Strathclyde estimate that, in Strathclyde alone, education would cost £20 million a year extra? That is the equivalent of 600 extra teachers. That is the considered judgment of Strathclyde council. What is the Scottish Office view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question three: what is the Scottish Office's estimate of the loss of economies of scale? Strathclyde estimates that, under the proposed structures, it would cost between £10 million and £15 million extra to purchase the same volume of goods and services. That figure does not include increases in staffing and other overheads that will inevitably occur in 10 new Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a long discussion with Peter Peacock, the chairman of finance in Highland region. He is not of my party. He is known to the Scottish Office and the Minister. When considering bulk purchase, he gave the example of street lighting. The purchase of electricity for street lighting is done on a volume basis. The council receives a discount from the Hydro Board, because of the volume. I checked that with Lord Wilson, the new chairman of the Hydro Board, and the former Governor of Hong Kong. He gave me the impression that it was by no means certain that the Hydro Board would give the same advantages of bulk purchase to smaller authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that, under the old system of electricity sales and distribution, the competition that exists today did not occur. A large purchaser of power has a stronger position in the marketplace. Competition now exists between suppliers. That did not happen previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Competition may be difficult in the circumstances of the highlands. We should consider whether advantages will be available to any smaller authorities that are created. Perhaps an undertaking exists that all will be as before. However, I wish to hear that undertaking from a Scottish Office Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the highlands. I sympathise with his argument about difficulties in that region. However, will not the highlands remain as they are under the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the impression of Duncan McPherson and others that the Government have different proposals, That was why the strong highland briefing appeared. It would save time if undertakings about the highlands were given early in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission has identified large savings in cases where central purchasing is organised on a large scale. What consultation has taken place about bulk purchasing with English colleagues, who have relevant experience? Let us consider the problems of regional analysts. Strathclyde argues that, if it was decentralised, the work of the regional analyst would cost an extra £4 million to upgrade. That is an example, which should be checked. If the Scottish Office take a different view, then so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lothian gives the example of the bulk purchase of books for 48 secondary schools. Obviously, they are ordered centrally rather than by smaller authorities because there
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
are considerable financial advantages in that. On the general issue of the bulk purchase of education equipment, I would be interested to hear the Minister's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
COSLA has been advised that it could cost up to £100 million to provide the necessary headquarters and to service administrative buildings in the area of each of the new authorities. Some of that expenditure may be offset by capital receipts from the disposal of surplus property. It is unlikely that the amount will be significant in view of the types and locations of the property available and given the current state of the property market. I want to ask about that figure of £100 million needed by COSLA for new properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central region tell me that it could cost up to £ 15 million to build new office accommodation for a Clackmannan, Falkirk and Kincardine council. The Government may argue that it should use existing accommodation, but in that case it would be in Viewforth in Sterling so that council would have to operate out of Stirling. That is a possibility, but the Committee should be told whether that is likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the number of offices which will become redundant and which it will be impossible to get rid of. I cannot think of any other use to which Viewforth could be put. That situation may be repeated up and down Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the COSLA report, but I would like page 41 to be checked. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A further detailed study of the position in Wales was undertaken by the Assembly of Welsh Counties. This reveals that, far from being an overestimate (given the lack of property costs elsewhere), the property costs in Wales will be substantially higher than first forecast. Instead of £23 to £34 million, they are more likely to amount to something of the order of £48 to £58 million."</p></blockquote>
COSLA adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These changes in the main are due to:</p></blockquote>

That adds up to a figure of £100 million or more. By Tuesday, the Minister and his advisers will have had time to reflect and give us an interested and substantive answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we come on to the question of the cost of the joint boards. Central region tells us that 11 out of the 19 local government services will be needed to be delivered by the use of joint arrangements. The highlands region already has joint boards for police and fire but it points out that once councillors go to joint boards they do not feel accountable to their parent council. The whole experience is that joint boards increase costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
As the Minister will know that influenced the whole tenor of the Wheatley report. Many started off in favour of unitary authorities. However, when it is necessary to have joint boards to do something on a sufficient scale, not only do they break the democratic link, but they are extremely costly. People on joint boards are not directly accountable to the council which sent them there. What do the Government estimate the cost of joint boards to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth point relates to the assessment of costs and the point that was fairly made by the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) about district councils and their submissions. The COSLA study has been prepared on a consistent basis with the guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment for England and Wales. Simplified models were used by Touche Ross for Wales and for Scotland. Is the Minister aware of the methodology used by district councils and others who have given costs and savings in their responses? If not, why has he not asked for a proper analysis of those submissions? The submissions are often made on a rather different basis, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central, would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixthly, I should like to ask about the White Paper costing. No details of the methodology used to calculate transitional costs appear in the White Paper. The information given is frankly rather sketchy and it is not possible to derive the make-up of the costs shown. The costs start at between £42 million and £83 million, winding up at between £25 million and £40 million with shadow authorities costing £23 million and others costing between £30 million and £50 million. The total comes to between £120 million and £196 million. We would be grateful for some reference to the methodology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seventhly, I come to the question of European funding. Strathclyde was able to attract £300 million in loans at favourable rates from the European investment bank. For four years I was a member of the budget committee and budget sub-committee of the European Parliament. When dealing with tough colleagues like Martin Bangemann one realised how well put together packages, at which the Germans were adept, cut far more ice than those that came in in dribs and drabs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only really large authorities can put forward the kind of packages that bring the lolly back from Brussels. It may not be right but that is one of what the Government would call the facts of life. Does the Minister think that the smaller local authorities could put packages together such as the £90 million that has come to Strathclyde from the European social fund providing some 67,000 places or the £260 million from the European development fund. It is unlikely that 10 new authorities would be able to afford a full time Europe Union liaison officer. That sort of expertise could be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My seventh question, as I said, concerns European funding and the advantage of highland region speaking to Brussels with one voice. It would save trouble if we could be told that there are to be no changes in the highlands. There is concern there about objective 5B status for the Highlands and Islands and objective 1 status, which is, I gather, being negotiated. If the region is broken up, there will be problems attracting such European money. If a tax base is fragmented, given the additionality rules is it possible to produce the same resources to attract European money? It certainly becomes more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Question eight: What is the Scottish Office view on the costs of rephasing the large projects that small councils cannot afford to carry out? Have the Government discussed that and what, for example, will be done about capital consent for big projects that involve more than one authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question nine: I ask the Committee to bear with me on the subject of computer systems, because I want to go into it in detail. It is important. Central region, one of the smaller regions, claims that it will cost at least £4 million merely to split up the existing computer systems. Lothian and Strathclyde believe that the figure is much more. What is the cost of preparing new computer systems for new councils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great many people will read the debates on this subject, so for the sake of coherence I refer to a letter that I wrote to the Minister on 25 January, as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Allan,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In advance of the Committee Stage of the Local Government Bill, could you clarify what arrangements you have in mind to put in place to ensure the proper integration of the IT systems of the preceding authorities, on which Local Government has become increasingly dependent in the last 20 years, with those of your new authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At what expense are the new authorities going to integrate GIS systems with those of existing local authorities? I cannot find any mention of IT systems in the Bill. Because of the urgency, I deem it sensible to copy this letter to Dr. Jim Cuthbert, the Chief Statistician."</p></blockquote>
I received a reply from the Minister before this morning's debate, and I thank the Minister for his courtesy. It is important to put it on the record, because I have comments to make about it. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Tam,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Thank you for your letter of 25th January raising questions in relation to local government IT systems.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The integration of computing systems"—</p></blockquote>
I wish that we could read documents into the record, but it would seem that we cannot—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will clearly be an important aspect of this reorganization … It would be extremely difficult for central Government"—you bet it is difficult for central Government—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"… to stipulate how each authority should go about merging old and new computer systems."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Whips—that is my great quality—so I am operating under a curfew. I make no bones about returning to the question of information technology in clauses 15 and 56, but—it is a very important "but"—at least £40 million is involved. That is just the costs; the dislocation is mind boggling. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, today, with advanced, sophisticated systems, it is difficult to establish new databases. It is extremely costly and time-consuming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You asked me Mr. Martin, to paraphrase what the Government are saying, and I shall do so succinctly under six headings. One, they say that the complexity of specially developed packages makes it impractical for central Government to impose a standard model on all authorities. Secondly, the complexity of the task, and its importance, has been acknowledged in all the Government's consultation papers on reorganisation. There is a question mark over that because I do not think that it has been fully understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it is clear from the comments received in response to the consultation exercises that the planning of IT systems should begin as far in advance as possible. The Minister says that he hopes that most local authorities are already beginning to think of these matters. We shall return to this issue in clause 56, but I wonder what notice has been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the potential expense of integrating new IT systems is considerable. In the White Paper, the Government acknowledge that there will be a cost inherent in a transfer of IT to councils. What they have not acknowledged is the sheer level of that cost—I return to the £40 million figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, the Governmet say that the costs will be largely dependent on the approach adopted by each council—that is buck passing—and it will ultimately be a matter for those councils, which will have to take account of likely costs of IT and estimate the financial costs of reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that IT is a major problem, and at the heart of it is the fact that many of these systems are dedicated? It will be difficult to sort out new systems for new authorities. The dedicated nature of IT is at the heart of the problem and the expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has experience of running a council and has been a provost. He will know that there are different systems in almost every area. It is not as simple as installing a mainframe system. We shall return to this matter on clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does COSLA say about this matter? Page 12 of its report states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This particular area of transitional costs, like property, has received only limited consideration within the Touche Ross study and the Secretary of State's projections. Once again there are clear differences in approach as to how this area of costs has been quantified in England and Wales as opposed to Scotland. Based on a realistic approach incorporating suggestions from technical experts, it is likely that IT transitional costs will be of the order of £40 million."</p></blockquote>
I want to know where that £40 million will come from. I suspect that there is no new money; it will have to be found from existing services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have been properly and understandably consulted by the Whips, I shall not go into detail about pages 47 to 49 of the COSLA recommendations because Ministers ought to put their heads together, use cold towels if necessary and thoroughly consider what is set out on those pages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the run-up to reorganisation, the core financial systems of payroll accounts payable, accounts receivable and the general ledger could be centralised and run on regional council mainframes. That is possible but I should like details of the cost of it. The report reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With this in place, a strategic plan for the new unitary authorities could be devised for the medium and longer terms. Costs in this interim period could consist of linking centres, partitioning data and strategic planning. After a period of around two to three years the new unitary authorities might want to take forward their own IT facilities to incorporate their core financial systems."</p></blockquote>
The report makes a series of operational assumptions. There is the question of strategic assessment and the matter of core mainframe systems. There is also detail of terminals, communications and cabling, the transferring of data from existing systems, and the partitioning of systems. The council tax assessment could, it is stated, amount to £250,000, and to £100,000 at least. The distributive regional systems and headquarters systems and PCs are included. There is mention of data disaggregation communications and training. Water and drainage complications are dealt with, as are existing district systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion is that a significant proportion of the total cost of the £40 million identified would require capital consents from the Secretary of State. I suspect that there is no promise whatever of capital consents. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If that additional consent is not forthcoming, there could be a significant impact on service delivery."</p></blockquote>
I must tell the Minister that I have been told by a completely different authority that it suspects that £40 million is a ludicrous underestimate. I say this with care. The Minister accepts that costs will arise from the reorganisation of computer systems. He will be aware that COSLA has undertaken detailed research and identified the costs for each proposed new local authority. Does the Minister agree that COSLA's estimate of £40 million of transitional costs is at least an authoritative estimate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with ongoing costs in my 11th question. Does the Minister agree that there are unlikely to be substantial ongoing savings with a 28-authority structure? How are transitional costs to be met between 1995 and 1997? Will council tax bills be allowed to rise, or will services have to be lowered to pay for these costs? Either there will be a rise in council tax, or standards will be lowered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one example—the tricky question of pension enhancement, which is a major ongoing cost. Touche Ross assumes that pension enhancement will be very limited. Its report shows it as a transitional cost only. Surely ongoing costs should be measured over a 15-year period. Touche Ross uses only a five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
The Government assume that there will be substantial ongoing savings that will pay for transitional costs in a very short time. But COSLA shows that there will be no ongoing savings, and substantially higher costs. Those costs will have to be met, assuming that there is no addition of Treasury money, otherwise there will be a breakdown—certainly a diminution—of ongoing services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that their intention is to simplify local government by introducing a single-tier system. Will the Minister concede that the more local the Government make local government, the more joint boards there will be established? There will still therefore, be a two -tier system. That case has been argued at considerable length by Eric Milligan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it really all worth the candle? Is it worth the cost, the disruption, the agony, the number of people who will be diverted from what they ought to be doing and the number of people who will throw in the sponge and take early retirement rather than face another local government reorganisation in their lifetime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with speaking late in the debate is that many points have already been raised in some detail. The hon. Member for Linlithgow has experience of and expertise in local government. I ask the Government to respond in detail to his points. They deserve answers and I hope that we will get them before the end of our sitting, as they go to the heart of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finance is the key to the system and will decide whether it succeeds or fails. The debate has revolved around two moving targets that have never locked onto one another. Two reports and sets of estimates have been considered, but they have not been compared in detail, The Government should meet CIPFA, if not COSLA, to consider the detail of the proposals and discover the truth. If the finance of the new system is wrong, the system will inevitably fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have learned today that there will be no new cash. That is a danger signal and a warning to the new authorities that stress will be imposed on services. It will be hard to maintain current rates and quality of services. The Government seem to think that somehow the changes will be cheap. I can assure them that it will not work out that way; it never does. Costs inevitably spiral with parallel authorities and officials working night and day for two authorities. Whatever the estimates, the real cost will be higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's certainty worries me. The Government have given absolute figures for the transition costs of between £120 million and £190 million. Leaving aside the fact that there is variation in those figures, I wonder if they are correct. Ultimately, they are guesses or estimates with built-in assumptions. What are those Government guesses and assumptions? We must get to the truth of the matter. Central Government budgets have not tended to be too accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he accepts what the Treasury has said, but the Treasury has rarely met its budget targets. It has had massive overspends—quite apart from losing billions of pounds on black Wednesday. Central Government could learn a thing or two from local authorities. I refer the Minister to COSLA's critique, which is well worth studying and points out that local authorities meet their budget target within 1 per cent. either way. Central Government can rarely, if ever, say that. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
Government tend to anticipate low costs. COSLA has been accused of anticipating high costs. There is a case to answer, The COSLA estimate of transition costs is over three times the Government figure. With that much discrepancy, someone must be wrong. Let us get to the truth of the matter, because if the finance is wrong, the system will be wrong and will get off to the worst possible start. I ask the Government not just to attack COSLA's figures—that is easy—but to consider them, compare them with their own figures and make the system as open as possible. The Government claims to believe in open government. Let us have their guesstimates and assumptions so that we can reach the truth and understand the finance of the new system exactly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government rely on an argument about structures, but it is one that works both ways. They think that if small authorities amalgamate to form a large authority, savings will be made. However, when a large authority, such as Strathclyde is split into smaller authorities, that surely balances the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are the largest employers in many areas; people depend on them for employment. It is estimated that between 700 and 2,200 jobs will be lost. I want to know which jobs will be lost and which specialists will be lost to local authorities. From where do the Government get their figures? We must know so that we can judge the exact effect on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a loss of jobs will affect local economies, reduce income and break up expert teams in departments. There is a wider problem of property which will be sold into an already depressed property market. There is genuine fear that the Government will use cut-price local government property sales to bankroll the changes by generating cash. That is the wrong way to implement such reorganisation. I am worried by the number of jobs that will be lost. Will the Government explain who is to go? I do not believe that they could find—in classic "Yes, Minister" pose—2,200 tea ladies to sack. It is important to know exactly what the government have in mind, but they have not yet explained that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I refer the Minister to the IT costs, because I believe that the hon. Member for Linlithgow has hit on a major problem. Whole computer systems may become obsolete and unusable if the role for which they are used is changed by the reorganisation. Systems may become unsuited to the purpose for which they were designed. Many of those systems are custom built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right, and I hope that the Government accept that, because extra costs will be met by the money for services. The issue is about services. I think that the hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley understands that. Ultimately, services will be reduced. All opposition parties want to get that message across to the Government. New systems automatically have teething problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that the changes will mean a reduction in services, why is he so enthusiastic about creating a single-tier Angus authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Angus authority is well run at present and it would continue to be exceedingly well run. We know how to provide good local government services. I have difficulties not with Angus but with artificial, gerrymandered boundaries that the Government have created purely for the political convenience of the Conservative party. I want boundaries that relate to real communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If new computer systems, which are at the heart of modern systems of government, must be introduced, that will automatically mean massive costs, teething problems and staff retraining. Were those costs included in the Government's figures? Have property and buildings been costed in the Government's calculations? Will the Minister describe the financial benefits envisaged by the change from the larger area-based maintenance contracts to a multitude of small, individual, expensive contracts? What will be the effect of that change, and has it been included in the very low Government figure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is untrue that local government is vastly inefficient and massively expensive. It might suit the Conservative party to say that in its propaganda, but it is not true in Scotland. With few exceptions, local government offers effective, high quality local services at reasonable cost. Over decades, we have been well served by our local authority officials and councillors. The myth makers may have cause to talk about certain—dare I say it—English authorities, but such accusations cannot be laid in Scotland. In previous Local Government Bills, I could hardly believe what I heard about certain notorious authorities in England. But such criticisms have never applied to Scotland, where there is high-quality service provision at reasonable public cost. We have been well served by our councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The COSLA critique pointed out the accuracy of local authority budgeting, which shows up well, especially when compared with central Government. COSLA has challenged the Government to justify their financial accountancy assumptions. I hope that the Government will take up that challenge. Will the Minister tell us the Government's basis of calculation? We do not want to hear
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
a simple refutation of the COSLA report. If the Government do not want to meet COSLA, let them sit round the table with CIPFA—there are plenty of experts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the Government should meet CIPFA. We are trying to get at the truth. The Minister should not just refute what COSLA has said. I want to know the basis of the Governement's figures. If the finance is wrong, the whole system will be wrong from the start. Genuine open Government would allow access to information about the costs, estimates and assumptions on which the Government have based their financial predictions. It is important because it will affect how those new councils operate in providing services. The calculations directly affect the financial future of the new authorities and their base budget, which will inevitably reflect on service provision. Will the Minister respond to the detailed points raised by the hon. Member for Linlithgow? Those matters are at the heart of the Government's proposals for the reorganisation of local government. Let us get to the truth of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the costs of a Scottish Parliament would be greater than for the reorganisation of local government. The costs of a Scottish Parliament would be nothing like so great, because of the bureaucracy that already exists in the Scottish Office, where there are tens of thousands of civil servants who are democratically unaccountable to the Scottish people. The great benefit of a Scottish Parliament would be that democracy would be increased. The Bill will remove democracy in Scotland and set up quangos that are unaccountable to anyone, except those appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The reporter to the children's panels will be taken from local authority control; urban funding will be removed eventually, so there will be less democracy in Scotland at greater cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the impartiality of consultants, and Touche Ross in particular. No one is calling into question the integrity—professional or otherwise—of those involved at Touche Ross who produced the report estimating the costs implicit in the reorganisation. It is important to remember, however, that consultants are paid agents and, naturally, they want to please their employers. They tend, therefore, to report what their employers want to hear. As you know, Mr. Martin, because you come from Glasgow, the Celtic board, for example, has employed a firm of consultants called Super Stadia, which has convinced the board that it needs a new stadium. Some of the directors even believe it themselves, but that does not mean that it will happen in the real world. That is how we should regard the Touche Ross report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Touche Ross states that costs arising from the local government reorganisation will be minimal, the reality is that the COSLA report showed that significant costs will be attributed to the transition from the two-tier system of local government to the single-tier system proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was quick to rise earlier to argue about the report from Fife regional council so I hope that he will not mind if I, in turn, quote from the report by Tayside regional council, which examined the cost implications for the three new authorities in the Tayside area. The report was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
produced on the authority of the chief executive of Tayside regional council—Mr. Robert Black. I do not think that the Government would dare to question the integrity of Mr. Robert Black, especially because they introduced legislaion not long ago to ensure that chief officers on councils are non-political and do not take sides. We are told that it is now impossible to have politically-prejudiced chief officers on councils.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the same report and I want to put on record that no one should doubt the integrity of Mr. Robert Black, However, I wonder what the hon. Gentleman thinks about the integrity of the report produced by Dundee district council. Is there a suggestion that the Dundee district chief executive is not to be trusted because he contradicts the contents of Mr. Black's report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the Dundee district council report next. If the hon. Gentleman is patient, he will hear what that says too, and it does not help the Government's case one iota.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it says in the introduction, the report by Tayside regional council claims to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a realistic and genuine attempt to identify those additional one-off costs."</p></blockquote>
Those people who produced the report know what they are talking about. They are involved in local government and they know the cost of local government services. They know what are the implications of the Bill, unlike Ministers who know nothing about local government in Scotland because they spend every day of their working lives in central Government. They may know about the way in which central Government provides services, but they do not know about local government. Local government officers do, and so the Government should listen when local government officers produce intelligent analysis of what is likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider staff costs. The Minister said that staff will be a matter for the new councils, but, of course, he expects redundancies. He would not say that there will not be redundancies. Indeed, his case is based on the fact that single tiers will cost less because there will be redundancies in local councils. It stands to reason that, if regional councils are abolished, the headquarters and the administration, finance, property and planning departments of those councils are likely to lose several senior staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know exactly what the cost will be because the Minister has not told anyone yet what rules and conditions are likely to apply to early retirement—what the redundancy terms and conditions will be for officers who lose their posts as a result of the changes. He has not said whether staff will automatically transfer to the new councils or whether the posts in the new councils will be advertised and open to competition. We do not know any of those details and so we cannot be precise about the figures, but we can broadly estimate what the impact of redundancies is likely to be. Tayside regional council suggests that the cost of redundancies and early retirement alone will be £2,600 million. Then, using the Touche Ross figures for relocation costs and recruitment expenses and taking the Tayside portion of the national figure, it produces a cost to the three new local councils in Scotland over the next three years: Dundee council, £1.3 million arising from staff relocation
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
and recruitment expenses; Perthshire and Kinross council, £1,080 million. Perhaps that is why the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) was not allowed to serve on the Committee. He would not vote for changes that would lead to his local council of Angus and Mearns incurring additional costs of £980,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be necessary to plan new corporate strategies and to recruit staff from the former council to help in the task of setting up the new council. It is estimated that the cost to Tayside will be £1.6 million over three years. The Minister said that residuary bodies will be set up to achieve the winding up of the old authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tayside regional council officers, using figures quoted by the Government's advisers Touche Ross, and COSLA, concluded that the cost of winding up Dundee City over five years will be £2.475 million; the cost of winding up Perth and Kinross will be £1.996 million; and the cost of winding up Angus and Mearns will be £1.788 million. The total cost in the Tayside area will be £6.250 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information technology and communications have been dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. In the Tayside area, the significant costs will be £800,000 for Dundee, £590,000 for Perthshire and Kinross and £560,000 for Angus and Mearns. The new councils will have to change their notepaper, the colour of their badge and the uniforms worn by people in, for example, the rent office. That will be an additional cost of £500,000 spread over the three councils. There are also property implications. In summing up the total cost over the first three years of the councils' existence, Tayside regional council estimates that Dundee will have to spend an extra £5.5 million, Perth and Kinross an extra £4.5 million and Angus and Mearns an extra £4.178 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures might not mean much to the Minister. He may shrug them off because, after all, the Government are used to wasting hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. But think what the extra cost will mean to council tax payers who live in those areas. Tayside regional council has estimated the probable impact on council tax of the transitional costs associated with the changes. In Dundee, council tax payers will pay an additional £99 in the first year of the council—an increase of 16 per cent. In Perthshire and Kinross, the council tax will cost an extra £80 a year, in Angus and Mearns, it will cost an extra £110 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might say that that is a cost well worth paying. Indeed, I remember the Secretary of State telling me, after I had commented on the cost of the poll tax, that every penny spent is one that is worth paying for the great benefits that will arise from the poll tax. The poll tax has now gone—£14 billion of public money was wasted on the Government's mad experiment. Now they are proposing to do the same all over again with local government reform. They will not pay the price for that: it will be paid for by the people who live in Scotland. Those people will have to pay extra council tax and, at the same time, suffer reduced services as a result of the changes.

	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
The report makes clear the attitude of Dundee district council to the proposals for a single-tier council. It states that as a result of the reduced populations that will be brought about by the gerrymandered boundaries—the Government are trying to win Angus and Mearns and so take it away from the SNP—Dundee will lose up to £2.279 million in grant-aided Government expenditure. The report contains the estimate that council tax revenue will be cut by £1.3 million, or £3.9 million when the loss of the regional and water rates take effect. Dundee city council estimates that 400 jobs will be lost from the district and regional councils. It estimates also that the level of service in Dundee to ordinary people who will be paying the extra £99 every year in council tax will be vastly reduced because of the Government's proposals. If the hon. Member for Tayside, North—who was born and raised in Dundee—believes that he can sell those proposals on any doorstep in Dundee, I invite him to get back up to Dundee, knock on a few doors and hear what people have to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I am regularly in Dundee, so there is no advantage in his making such challenges. Will he confirm that Dundee City district council, Angus district council and Perth and Kinross district council favour single-tier authorities based as near as possible on their present boundaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dundee City district council favours a single-tier authority based on its present boundary under a directly elected Scottish Parliament. The hon. Gentleman should explain fully what the district council supports. It supports what I said, not the gerrymandered nonsense suggested in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Touche Ross report is based on several assumptions which the Government told it to make when it estimated the cost. One assumption was that "all the existing functions" should be assumed to remain with the local authorities. That is not happening. The reporter to the children's panel service has been taken away from the local authorities, as has water and sewerage administration. That will have major cost implications for the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody should try to tell me that setting up three big, powerful new quangos will lead to cost savings for people who pay taxes in Scotland. I went home briefly this evening and saw a programme on ITV which dealt with some of the quangos which have been set up by the Government. One was the Welsh Development Agency, which an American fraudster was appointed to run—he made off with £50 million of the agency's furniture and equipment. That is what happens when powerful quangos are set up and when the Secretary of State appoints heads who are unaccountable to those who they rule. That will happen when the Government sets up the new quangos in Scotland. There are worse examples: Government Department ran an efficiency saving scheme and rewards were given to those who made those cost and efficiency savings. The reward was the hiring of ships for parties. One ship was hired out with floodlighting, music and free drinks for £70,000—that was the typical cost of one party to reward people who work for the Government. That is what happens when democracy is removed—abuses multiply. Setting up water boards will lead to the same problems in Scotland; there will be more waste of public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
Conservative Members who are about to vote for the measures in the Bill had better understand that they are responsible. When scandals start to emerge in Scotland about the waste in public expenditure, it will be their fault; they will be held accountable by those who have to pay the bill at the end of the day—the taxpayers and the electors. I could continue for much longer but I my hon. Friends are signalling that I should conclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members think that this is any easy number; they sit quietly doing their correspondence and get kudos from their Whip for voting through legislation which nobody in Scotland wants. The Government cannot even sell the measures to Tory supporters: The Tory group of Tayside regional council voted against the proposals in the Bill—it wants regional councils and services to be retained and thinks that the Governtment's proposals are a waste of public money and of everybody's time. The people in that group live in Scotland, so they know more about the issues than certain Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took the trouble to subscribe to the amendment, because I think that it is quite important. We have had an important debate. As has been said by other hon. Members, however, the Government—and the Minister in his initial submission—fell far short of what we expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tayside, North made an interesting contribution when he said that he was willing to examine the detail of the amendment if we provided more background about its aim. I observe, in parentheses, that that is rich coming from a Government whose Bill assumes powers for the Secretary of State for Scotland with no detail of any kind and who invites the Committee to agree. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Tayside, North made the fair point. If we include the words "economy, efficiency and effectiveness", it is incumbent on us to say more about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does that mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It means that the authorities, which the clause sets up, should have as one of their primary aims "economy, efficiency and effectiveness". That should be in the body of the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman will bear with us, he will find that as the work of the Committee unfolds amendments will be tabled to give effect to that overarching aim. It is right to put that in clause 1 because it would make it clear that that should be one of the primary duties and functions of the new authorities. The hon. Gentleman is right to say and was generous enough to admit that those ideas run with the grain of his philosophy. I hope that he will support us on future amendments if we can find ways and to satisfy him on "economy, efficiency and effectiveness".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will require from the Committee more transparency than at present. The Government are founding their case largely on an economic basis. That was not so in 1973. The Committee will accept that then, people were so convinced of he need for change that the amount of money—no one was trying to be profligate—was not an issue of great substance. There were arguments about "economy, effectiveness and efficiency", but the main aim in 1973 was constitutional and procedural and concerned the function, duties and liabilities of local authorities following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
The justification for the reform in the Bill is so thin in comparison with the case in 1973 that the Government have been thrown back on justifying the change by way of trying to save costs. I share that aim. If we are making changes, we should try to make them as economically as possible. It is difficult for members of the Committee, as it will be for other hon. Members, to decide objectively whether costs or savings will result. The Government have a duty to be more forthcoming about their assumptions and me way in which they made their calculations. The Minister must accept that the Touche Ross report is out of date. Prices and costs have changed and since October 1992 a number of significant changes have occurred, not least in the cost of information technology, which the Government are bound to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should not only give us more beef in terms of the Government's financial justification, but should accept amendments to provide transparency in the costs and savings. So many imponderables exist, some of which were raised earlier in our debate, that it may be difficult to quantify them precisely, but the Minister should accept that duties and liabilities should be imposed in the primary legislation on local authorities, central Government, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Audit Commission and so on, to require them to keep careful account of costs and savings over three or five years. People would then know with some certainty whether the Government, COSLA, Dundee district council and so on were right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed putative costs, and the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) referred to wide discrepancies, which worry me. It would be a bonus if we could look back. That experience would also be available to future Standing Committees which consider local government reform in Scotland; information wouuld also be available in other parts of the country. CIPFA and Touche Ross drew on the experience of Wales and Greater Manchester, and of the abolition of the Greater London council. The Minister should accept that an important aspect of the Committee's work is to set up a system that will determine with certainty the costs and savings in the longer term. That would be helpful to everyone in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that local authorities are entitled to defend then-local interests, but I am worried about the amount of money that some authorities, at both district and regional level, spend on costings, reports and submissions in glossy pamphlets. It is important that they make submissions, and the Minister has been generous in seeing people. It is essential that he submit himself to personal meetings, but we would be staggered if we knew the full cost of some of the consultancy fees that have been paid to firms throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to discuss companies in detail. I simply want to record that a lot of money has been spent and I do not know to what effect. We must be careful not to trade arguments and reports in the Committee. It is less than satisfactory if the Minister simply trades arguments and confronts Opposition Members with reports—in my case that might be a report from the three
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
district authorities versus the region. That is not good enough; the onus is on him to establish the feasibility of economic costings for the programme of reform. I am not opposed to the concept of unitary authorities. There is a nuance of a difference between me and the official Opposition and perhaps between me and the Scottish National party. I am willing to consider unitary authorities, and I believe that many savings could be made. But I am sceptical when the Minister produces costings which ignore the fact that nine mainland authorities currently provide 80 per cent. of services. Vague and superficial calculations—such as those carried out by Touche Ross, which produced graphs, extrapolated meaningless figures, and made value judgments—are not a good enough basis on which to conduct the Committee's work or consider the reform of local government. Most of my points have been made perfectly effectively by other hon. Members. Assumptions which are difficult to quantify include the disruption factor which has just been ignored in the past. The number of man hours used to generate briefs for consultants is one of the hidden costs that are difficult to qualify. I am nervous about the Minister's comments on redundancy and pension costs. People who are about to retire will also be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have only had the COSLA report for a matter of hours, but I am sure that we shall be able to make better use of it in debate on later clauses on the staff commission—I look forward to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tone of the Minister's remarks suggested that he would not honour some of the expected commitments to redundancy and pension payments. If he could reassure me on that issue, I would be grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, the amendment is important. I do not understand why the Government should not accept at least its principle. If they accept the priniple, Opposition Members will use a little creativity to produce amendments—acceptable to all hon. Members—which will impose effectiveness, economy and efficiency on the new councils created by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with some of the comments about value for money which were made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North also made that point. I can assure them that the issue is dealt with in clause 156, which is about obligations on local authorities to ensure that they exercise their functions with the best possible regard to value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a most interesting debate; members of the Committee know that many of the points flagged up by hon. Members will be made again in due course. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North mentioned the control of salaries, as did Opposition Members. Clause 11 provides the Government with specific powers over the control of salaries in the light of what happened when local government was previously reorganised, so we can debate that later. Funding for 1994–95 and for subsequent years has been mentioned frequently during the debate. The Secretary of State's public expenditure statement clarified the issue, but given the widespread interest, I will confirm it: the level of local authorities' costs next year in preparing for reform will be relatively small, and provision of £5 million hs been made in the settlement to cover that. The precise level of the extra costs which will face authorities as a consequence of reform in 1995–96 and 1996–97 remains uncertain within a range, because it will depend on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V006P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
decisions made by the new authorities. However, we do not expect the net costs to exceed between £30 million and £35 million in either year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In determining the planned level of Government-supported expenditure for those years, we assumed that the existing local authorities will incur local government reform costs of £25 million added to the Government-supported expenditure and aggregate external finance in 1995–96, and £55 million in 1996–97. In the latter year, there will be savings of £40 million. So the proposed new authorities will incur net reform costs of £15 million over and above the savings in 1996–97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Entirely outside the settlement, we are providing a total of £1.5 million over the next three years to cover the costs of the staff commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most interesting points made in the debate by hon. Members, in particular by the hon. Member for Linlithgow, was the estimate on information technology. He ingeniously put much of my letter to him on public record. I listened carefully to what hon. Members said and have had the opportunity to consider what COSLA said about information technology in its report. On page 49, it is clear that COSLA agrees with the Government's estimates. We estimate the cost to be £20 million. COSLA adds an estimated £20 million that local authorities may choose to spend in later years. That is not a transitional cost but an optional improvement to existing systems which might happen irrespective of the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow made several points about the highlands, all of which supported the Government's policy on a single-tier unitary authority for that area. I shall be meeting a delegation led by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) which proposes a different policy for the highlands.

The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked several detailed questions which I shall not be able to answer before our sitting is interrupted. However, I shall respond to him in person or, if not, write to him at the earliest opportunity.

The Government have taken into account many studies and recommendations. The Touche Ross figures were revised in the White Paper, which proves that we have an open mind.
