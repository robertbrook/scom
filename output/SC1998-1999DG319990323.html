	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Draft Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
I am pleased to present the draft order to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is needed to implement the devolution settlement for Scotland in relation to certain maritime matters, most notably in relation to sea fisheries. It does so by establishing a boundary between the waters within British fishery limits that are adjacent to Scotland and those adjacent to other parts of the United Kingdom. It creates a Scottish zone within British fishery limits. In general terms, Scots law for sea fisheries will apply within that zone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I set out the relevant provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 a little more fully to explain the significance of the Scottish Zone and the maritime boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under schedule 5 (c.6), the regulation of sea fishing outside the Scottish zone is reserved, except in relation to Scottish fishing boats. Section 126 provides a definition of a Scottish zone, which is, the sea within British fishery limits, adjacent to Scotland. In section 126(2), Her Majesty by order in council, may determine a boundary to distinguish between waters that are adjacent to Scotland and those that are adjacent to other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Order sets out the boundaries by listing the necessary co-ordinates in schedules to the order. An illustrated map has been attached to the order so that Members can see where the boundaries will run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boundary follows the normal convention for determining similar international boundaries, that is, a median line between the nearest points of land on either side, using the baselines that have been established around the coast of the UK in accordance with international law. For convenience there are two small exceptions to this rule, south of the Mull of Galloway and north of Lough Foyle, in Northern Ireland, where the boundaries follow the existing limit of the UK's territorial sea for short distances. Within the Scottish zone, the Scottish Parliament will have competence to make law for sea fisheries, and Scottish Ministers will exercise functions in relation to the regulation of sea fisheries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Minister's definition is a parody of itself, can he explain why the boundary on the map appears to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
follow a line of latitude after going out at an angle seeming to derive from the points of land on either side? I am thinking of the eastern boundary where it leaves my constituency, Berwick-upon-Tweed. It proceeds out to sea at an angle that is obviously drawn from the adjoining points of land, but when it is some distance out to sea, on the map it begins to resemble a line of latitude. Is that because it is defined from some further piece of land, or what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The northern boundary is at right angles from the line until Grampian region, the nearest point of land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I did not understand the Minister's response to what was a serious question. He looks at the kink at the point at which the north-easterly line turns east but there does not appear to be any specific relationship to land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are saying is that the northern boundary is at right angles to land until it cuts on the Grampian boundary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might benefit the Committee if the Minister were allowed to make his statement, after which hon. Members will be able to ask questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. That is a sensible suggestion, given that there are so many details. I realise that the order is just a mass of coordinates and that the boundary may be less specific than possible in relation to the size of the map.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the Scottish zone, the Scottish Parliament will have competence to make law for sea fisheries, and Scottish Ministers will exercise functions in relation to the regulation of sea fisheries. In both cases, of course, the Parliament and Scottish Ministers will have to act in accordance with our international obligations—notably with EU law for fisheries and the common fisheries policy. In practice, therefore, the Scottish zone marks the sea area where EU law on fisheries, as well as Scots law will be enforced by Scottish Ministers and their officials and by Scottish courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain, because it is not at all clear to me, the difference in practical terms for people fishing in the Scottish zone as opposed to the English zone of British limits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I suggest that the Minister answers that question later and that the Committee observe my suggestion that our business would be dealt with more coherently if the Minister were allowed to make a statement before questions were asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. O'Hara. I am not sure from your directive what you mean. We are debating a statutory instrument so all that we can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
do is to make speeches, not put questions to the Minister—or are you directing a different process from that to which I am normally used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have rarely known hon. Members to miss the opportunity of asking questions when making a speech or any other intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I agree with your suggestion and will return to the question later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is, I repeat, that in practice the Scottish zone marks the sea area where EU law on fisheries as well as Scots law will be enforced by Scottish Ministers and their officials and by Scottish courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the avoidance of any doubt or confusion, I should explain that the Scottish Parliament will also be able to make laws to govern the activities of Scottish fishing boats, even when those boats are operating outwith the Scottish zone. For example, the Scottish Parliament might wish to introduce new licensing arrangements to control the activities of Scottish fishing boats, and the conditions of such licences would still apply to those boats, irrespective of where they may be operating, as a matter of Scots law. Such Scottish boats, of course, would also be subject to local fisheries laws if they were operating within the fishery limits of another country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boundary provided by the order has particular significance for sea fisheries. I wish to make it clear, though it should be self-evident, that the boundary has no significance for other matters at sea which are reserved. In particular, it has no relevance to the regulation of oil and gas exploration and production at sea, which are reserved matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boundary, however, does have potential significance in relation to other matters that are devolved, notably within the UK territorial sea. That is the margin of sea within 12 miles of UK baselines where the UK is authorised by international treaty to exercise certain functions of a sovereign state. Certain devolved functions may be exercisable within the territorial sea, such as the enforcement of criminal law or the control of pollution from land. The boundary that is specified in this draft order does not automatically apply to such functions, but it provides an obvious line of demarcation for the exercise of appropriate functions by Scottish Ministers or public authorities in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, hon. Members will see from section 126 of the Scotland Act 1998 that the term "Scotland" does extend to include the territorial sea around Scotland, which is relevant for certain provisions of that Act. One important example is section 75, which defines a Scottish taxpayer with regard to the number of days spent by a person within Scotland. In that respect, the boundary provided within the territorial sea will also be relevant for those purposes of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I draw the Committee's attention to the boundary that is established by this order within the Solway firth. Here, the draft order would establish a new, simplified boundary which the Government believe will be helpful for the future enforcement of law in that area. At present, the border between
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Scotland and England is understood in common law to follow the central line of the border Esk and to follow the combined Eden and Esk rivers at low tide—though I should add that there is some uncertainty about the exact boundary opposite the town of Annan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the course of the river at low tide can vary greatly, depending on the effect of the ebb tide on the mud and sand flats of the Solway firth. This is rather specific stuff, which I am sure that some Members of the Committee will be following with enormous interest. As a result of the tides, there is always some uncertainty about where the border may lie at any moment, which has caused difficulty in establishing the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies and of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boundary set out in the draft order will not change the common law border, but it will provide a basis for future legislation, whether at Westminster or by the Scottish Parliament. The prospect of a clear and simplified boundary should avoid the uncertainty inherent in the present arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those, I hope, helpful comments, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the members of the Committee for heeding my advice to conduct the proceedings as they have. They will take the opportunity to ask the Minister questions during their speeches and I am sure that the Minister will provide the answers when he responds to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's speech contained a number of interesting points, as does the order. However, I want to begin with a highly apposite question. It would in any case have been my first question, but it was asked by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith); the Minister was not in a position to answer it at the time, but perhaps he now is. The question was of signal importance, for reasons to which I shall come later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The line that is drawn to the east clearly traverses a north-easterly path and then takes a turn to the south and goes east. Whatever the explanation, it is not the one that the Minister gave us. I should be grateful if he would clarify that in a way that an ordinary human being who is not a geographer can understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister said towards the close of his remarks that the boundary would not change the common law border. I think that he was referring to the west rather than to the east, but I take it that the principle extends both sides. Are there precedents, in common law, administrative practice or statute law, from which these lines diverge? In other words, are we here dealing with a set of geographical limits for which there is good precedent one way or the other, administratively or legally, or with a new set of definitions, which have not been used previously for most purposes and in most of the areas demarcated? The answer to that is extremely important in understanding the answers to the next sets of question that I want to pose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Moving from the geography of the line to its effects, I come first to the question of precedent. When we discussed the order before the Committee met, my hon. Friends and I were worried about how far it went beyond the demarcation of fisheries and how far it extended, as a matter of precedent, into issues where far more is immediately at stake, or might be at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said some interesting things about that. The record will show his exact words, but I think that he said that the map had no relevance for other issues such as oil and gas. However, a few sentences later he said that the set of lines constituted an obvious line of demarcation. Indeed, he went on to describe other affects that the line might have, for example in relation to residence. His argument for supposing that it would have no relevance for matters such as oil and gas was, if I remember correctly, that they are reserved matters. I come to my questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, is the Minister clear in his mind which matters are sufficiently reserved for the order not to have a precedent effect on them? If so, what are they? Assiduous examination during the past few days of the parts of schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 dealing with reservation in relation to quite another matter— the Food Standards Agency—has persuaded us that there is great scope for ambiguity about what things are and what are not excepted from the specific and general reservations; more scope than we were aware of when the Bill was being debated. At that time, Labour Members raised some perspicuous points about that matter, which an examination of the 
	<i>Hansard</i> report reveals were not fully explored by Conservative Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are oil and gas clearly reserved, so that they fall within the category described by the Minister? If they are so reserved, why will not something that has been proposed as a set of geographical demarcations in an order relating to an Act of this Parliament have a precedent effect for a matter that is reserved to this Parliament? I do not follow the juridical logic of that. The order is being made by this House and the other place and makes provision for a reserved power to determine matters. Why, then, does it follow that the order cannot constitute a precedent for matters that are reserved to this House and the other place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are oil and gas a clearly reserved matter that falls within the category enunciated by the Minister? If so, we should pay attention to the Minister's logic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, that matter is of great concern when allied to the geography of the limits that I spoke about earlier. The Minister and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed will not be unaware that there is a difference between continuing the north-westerly route—which the line traverses in its first segment—up to the outer fishing limits and the contrary move of taking a turn to the right and going eastward. That represents a triangle of immense potential and actual value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the order have a precedent effect in relation to oil and gas, that triangle may become a matter of intense discussion between the Scottish Parliament
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
and the Scottish Executive, especially if our friends in the Scottish National Party find themselves in charge. It would also concern this House and the United Kingdom Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of the exact scope of the current production of that oil and gas triangle or of the reserves ascertained or expected of it, although I believe that they are substantial. Will the Minister provide guidance on that? Should the precedent effect apply, this matter will be of the greatest economic significance in the transitional history of the two Parliaments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a set of questions which—if that is possible—are of even greater significance. They do not relate substantially to the precise definition of the boundaries, but relate to the order as a whole. The Minister said that EU law would be enforced by Scottish Ministers within the limits defined by the boundaries. We do not doubt that that statement is accurate, nor do we doubt that it is the limit of the Government's immediate intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a series of questions arises. Bearing in mind that chronology has progressed since we debated the Bill that became the Scotland Act 1998, what is the role that Scottish Ministers will play in the Council of Ministers when it comes to dealing with matters that relate to fisheries within the limits?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that long discussions of such matters took place in the past, but time has moved on. When we debated the Scotland Bill, the Ministers said a great deal along the lines of "We cannot tell you yet". Now seems an admirable moment for that disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mechanism for the application of directives is obviously extremely important in that area. The Minister mentioned Scottish Ministers enforcing EU legislation. Is he saying that it will always be the case that the Scottish Parliament, under the relevant provisions of the Act which forces it to take cognisance of United Kingdom treaties, will enact such measures as are necessary under directives? Is the Minister sure that that will apply only in relation to fisheries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the precedent effect. If there were a directive on a reserved matter in which the geography was important in an area delimited as Scottish waters, would that directive automatically be implemented by virtue of an order or enactment of this House and the other place, not of the Scottish Parliament? Or will the fact that the lines have been drawn in this order in some way influence the view of which Parliament needs to enact the relevant provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening extremely carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I think that he is straying beyond matters that are strictly the business of the Committee, which is concerned with boundaries, not with enforcement and the relative responsibilities of the different Parliaments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall of course be guided by your advice, Mr. O'Hara, but the Minister said that one purpose of his having drawn the boundaries was that EU law within them should be enforced by Scottish, not English Ministers.

the case. As it deals with fisheries under the common fisheries policy, it is a matter of the relationship with the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right, but what does he define as English Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise unreservedly. We have before us a sterling example—if I may still use the word sterling—of a Scottish Minister who falls entirely within my definition of a United Kingdom Minister, which is, of course, what I should have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is germane, Mr. O'Hara, but I happily follow your advice because I have asked the questions that I wanted to ask, to which I hope that the Minister will give full replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister says today, although it will not be widely reported in the press and will not have a direct bearing on any great political issue, will indirectly matter tremendously. What we set on the record today may be used under Pepper 
	<i>v.</i> Hart as a basis for decisions on devolution issues taken by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will give carefully considered, unequivocal answers. If he feels unable to do so today, I hope that he will write to members of the Committee with the definitive answers and that by some means or other they will be entered in 
	<i>Hansard</i> to ensure that there is a firmer basis than currently exists for adjudications by the Judicial Committee on these immensely important geographical boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.53 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I want to refer specifically to the order, which probably has consequences for the future. Does the new boundary in the Solway firth follow the same principle of equidistance from the land boundaries on each side of the firth? I may have missed the Minister's answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the ability to make the calculations; I have to take it on trust that the areas co-ordinate on the map. It might have been sensible for the order to say by what method the co-ordinates had been calculated, in case there are errors in the printed order. There have been errors in other orders that have slipped through the House, and the Minister can do nothing to correct them. Perhaps, under Pepper 
	<i>v.</i> Hart, the fact that he has said something to the Committee may help sort out matters if the order contains a wildly out co-ordinate. I probably should know the answer to this question, but Grampian police are responsible for many of the offshore oil installations; does this boundary have any relation to their policing boundary, or is that derived in a different way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the sort of question that I had hoped to pose with the more general question about whether there were any administrative precedents. A good example of an administrative precedent would be, would it not, a policing boundary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, which deals with that point. My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed was planning to raise specific constituency issues. He warned the Minister of an issue of a general nature that he was going to raise which I thought I might also raise. The Minister must give the Committee a definition of loxodromic; if orders contain words like that, someone, at least, should know what they mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.56 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much look forward to defining a loxodromic boundary with the assistance of the Minister. It turns out to be rhumbic, but I did not know what that meant either. Parts of my constituency used to be disputed territory between England and Scotland. A small part of it changed hands 14 times. I am loth to see the debate move out to sea with this substantial triangle of sea now becoming the subject of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure used to bring the order before us today was necessary, and we debated it during the passage of what became the Scotland Act 1998. Obviously, in the heat of discussions on the major issues in that Act, it was difficult to have a careful discussion of this issue. It was envisaged at the time that we have such a discussion in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I now understand the basis on which the line has been drawn on the east coast, but I am not convinced that the map demonstrates the principle soundly. I take it that, when the line turns more directly eastward, the nearest point of land is on the Grampian coast and is no longer on the Northumberland and Berwickshire coast. The definition therefore draws from that piece of land. It produces a curious shape, the implications of which I shall come to in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One area in which the order will have little or no application, I take it, is salmon and freshwater fisheries because salmon fisheries in the Tweed box, for example, are treated as though they were Scottish law by a decision of the United Kingdom Parliament, and any change in the way that that is done would still have to be approved under order by the UK Parliament. There is, in practice, an extension of Scottish law across the national boundary in respect of salmon. It is one that relies on UK legislation and, as I understand it, will continue to do so. Therefore, the location of this boundary line does not directly affect it. I hope that the Minister will tell me if I am wrong, as it is an important issue affecting the livelihood of quite a lot of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the boundary has no relevance to a variety of matters, which he listed, but then, as the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) pointed out, he said that it was a useful boundary that might be drawn on in future legislation, and that its application beyond the area of sea fisheries might depend on its being incorporated in future legislation. If that is to happen we must think carefully
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
today about whether we are doing the right thing, because if we want the order to be used as a precedent it will have implications for other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take oil and gas as an example. My concern there is that increasingly, even though matters remain reserved and are conducted on a United Kindom basis, there develops a habit of attributing notional revenues to justify particular levels of public expenditure in England and Scotland. That is just one way in which the boundary line can be used for practical purposes in everyday political life and public discussion. So we need to be sure that the line is established on the right principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As these issues were not in Ministers' minds, I am reasonably confident that the line might have been drawn on the right principles, and that they were not deviously trying to work out some way of nabbing oilfields and gas fields from one country rather than another. The process that they have gone through does not suggest that, if I may put it in my usual not very cynical way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's explanation is all right as far as it goes, but I retain a certain nervousness. I want to be sure that the principles that he describes have been applied correctly and that, if they prove to have been in error, it is recognised that we shall have to return to the issue, if necessary with a modified order. I want to be sure that the order will have no effect on the way that so much salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation affecting the River Tweed and the Tweed box operates, but that its implications in other areas will depend on its being shown that the boundary line is sound, and reasonable to use for other purposes. If that cannot be shown I foresee some potential for unintended damage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.1 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumfries)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I picked up a copy of the order and looked at the co-ordinates, as someone not from marine stock I was totally confused by some of it. I want to ask questions about the Solway firth estuary and seek reassurance from my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussion has centred around fishing vessels, including fishing boats. I am concerned about the tradition of Haaf-netting, which dates back centuries. It is clearly popular in the Solway estuary. My home town depends greatly for its common good fund on the revenue from the licensing of Haaf-netsmen as well as licensing of stake and poke net fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The co-ordinates are before us, and my hon. Friend the Minister has told us that it was difficult to determine at any stage where the boundary lies. In some fishing seasons, the fishing channel will have moved so significantly that, whether there is fishing on the Scottish side of the border or on the English side, the impact on fishing can be detrimental. I seek an assurance that, given that the Solway firth is a tidal estuary, the order will not disadvantage the fishing rights of people who participate in a tradition that dates back centuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>11.03 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that, whenever I see orders relating to fishery limits and territorial waters these days, I automatically become nervous. Before going up to university, I spent a brief while on an offshore radio boat. In the 1960s, there was a famous court case involving a sand bank and the question whether Radio Caroline was within territorial limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question arises from that. There have been questions about the shape of United Kingdom territorial waters and the boundary between Scottish limits and, I suppose we must say, English limits—or the rest of the UK. Are these now being determined for all time—or at least until some future time when the statutory instrument might be changed—by the coordinates listed in the order, or can they be altered by changes in the appearance of sand banks and so on? We hear about global warming. Have parts of the boundaries been drawn on account of existing sand banks that might not exist in future? My first question is, how concrete are the borders? Will they change, depending on land masses within the fisheries limits, or are they set in stone by the co-ordinates in the order and capable of being changed only by secondary legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to raise the issue already mentioned by my hon. Friend—soon to be right hon. Friend—the Member for West Dorset and by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is right honourable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed: I am crossing over the honour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave firm assurances that oil and gas would not be affected. How secure is that? How could the order be changed to apply to oil and gas—through enabling secondary legislation, or would a decision need to be taken on the Floor of the House? People should know, because there seems to be some cynicism and concern about the shape of the boundary as it veers from a north-east to an easterly direction, giving more seas defined as Scottish territorial waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wondered what the definition of "giving more" was based on. How can more be given when there is not any in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, there is. By "more" I was defining area. It is obvious from the map that if the boundary were to go north-east and continue perpendicular to the shore, as it starts off doing, there would be less area. That is what I mean by more or less—the area designated to come under Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my final point. The Minister gave a clear definition of boundaries and competences. If an offence were committed in the Scottish area, it would come under Scottish law; if in the rest of the United Kingdom, I guess that it would come under English and Welsh law. However, what does that mean in practice? I am well aware of differences in court procedure, but what will it mean to people fishing in the area? Are there Scottish laws which people would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
have to be competent of or be aware of, knowing that if they crossed the ziggy-zaggy line they would be committing an offence, but that if they did the same act south of that line they would not? Will the Minister make that clear?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actually, I lied to the Committee. That was not my final but my penultimate question. My final question is about the controversial common fisheries policy. How does it affect the order? Is everything that we are discussing today in this Room, as so often with European legislation, over-ridden by the common fisheries policy? To what extent did the Minister discuss it with the relevant Commissioner? When did he last go to Brussels to discuss that matter with the relevant Commissioner, before the resigned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying from the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your advice, as ever, Mr. O'Hara. Nevertheless, it is important to ask the Minister what information he has gleaned from Brussels regarding the areas of competence within Scottish as opposed to English or European law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.8 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As they say, it has been an interesting debate so far. The hon. Member for West Dorset was agonised in posing some complex questions, but the thrust of the order is straightforward, technical and simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with one issue that united Opposition Members—the boundary. It is determined quite simply by the nearest point of land on either side. From the north-east coast of Berwickshire to the nearest point on the Scottish side is Grampian coastline. There is nothing too scientific involved, beyond that one way of defining Scottish adjacent waters. The real scientists on the Committee will know that loxodromic refers to a straight line between points representing a Mercator projection. I am sure that that could be the prelude to several other technical questions but the definition is straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for explaining what loxodromic means, as I had no idea. Does his very simple explanation mean that the direction of the coastline at the point nearest to any given point on the boundary line is perpendicular to the next section of the boundary line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can do no more than repeat the definition that I have given. If the hon. Gentleman would like me to provide, as a matter of courtesy, a two or three-page thesis on the matter, I shall happily provide one as a background note. I will also, as a matter of courtesy, circulate that to the other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may add to the questions for clarification that may be dealt with by the note. When the point from which the line is drawn becomes the Grampian coast, why does the Durham coast not become relevant? If it does there will be a different effect on the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that hon. Members are reading a bit too much complexity into the matter and suggesting that there is something either sinister or cynical about the measure. It is a straightforward representation with regard to the line. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed shakes his head, but I am keen to provide a detailed note if that is required, to make the context of the definition clearer to hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed raised a significant point about salmon fisheries, especially on the Tweed, in respect of the Solway. There is no effect. The clear unambiguous purport of the order is that no disadvantage is to be created. We are keen to protect the interests that are currently safeguarded, and nothing in the order will undermine that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another key issue that was raised is that of the boundary. As I said, the boundary is not a precedent for other matters, which are reserved, especially oil and gas. However, the boundary could be used in the future in discussions on other devolved matters. That would of course require a section 30 order, which would be negotiated between Westminster and the Edinburgh Parliament. It would relate to functions exercisable at sea that had been transferred to the Scottish Parliament. That is a wise and prudent move, because it is not entirely clear that the circumstances relating to the functions in question will never change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other significant point that was made concerned the Scottish adjacent waters, the territorial waters and beyond. Obviously, the common fisheries policy in EU law dictates the context. That is another unambiguous statement of fact. With respect to the Scottish adjacent waters, what will happen is a matter of jurisdiction for Scotland; it is about court procedure, enforcement procedure and what would happen in the event of violation of rules within the area of competence that we have defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have outlined is not terribly complicated. However, one of the reasons why devolution is happening is that for 300 years we have had our legal and education systems, and separate Churches. The arrangement mirrors the devolution of political administration and therefore involves nothing very significant. However, it not only allows us to police that area but enables the Scottish courts to use its powers to shape EU legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has mentioned policing and the courts, and I have no doubt that he is right, but he has not answered the fundamental question: will the Scottish Parliament be responsible for enacting any legislation that is necessary to translate directives in this area into law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is yes. Although the European situation is becoming increasingly complex, it is important for the whole of the United Kingdom. That is reflected in the devolution settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely helpful. Is the Minister saying that the Scottish Parliament's ability to enact European legislation will be defined by the lines on the map in respect of all matters that are, or later fall to be, devolved to the Scottish Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That leads on to the much more complex question that was asked earlier about the role of the Scottish Executive in the common fisheries policy and development policy at Westminster, because the UK is the member of the European Union. That is not what is being said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure deals with the full development of the UK position on fishing. There is to be one agreed line. The Westminster Executive and the Executive of the Scottish Parliament will be involved in discussions to shape that policy. When policy is defined within the European Union and a directive or legislation follows, that in turn will be shaped by the Scottish Executive for a Scottish context. Again, the adjacent waters definition is simply the basis on which all discussions on fishing matters take place with Westminster, and indeed subsequently with the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is offering important clarification. Does he mean that the Scottish Parliament could object to a directive, Scottish Ministers could make representations to that effect, UK Ministers could overrule them and, when the directive took effect, the Scottish Parliament would have to enact it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interesting though those questions are, they go far beyond the scope of the Committee's business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not incur your wrath, Mr. O'Hara, by seeking to correct the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked whether the order has any implications for the existing determination of civil or criminal jurisdiction in relation to offshore matters. Again, the answer is no. The policing issue was raised vis-a-vis Grampian, especially in relation to oil and gas, criminal jurisdiction, offshore activities and orders. A range of legislation is unaffected, so the current role of the police will not be affected by the new boundary that defines Scottish adjacent waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear earlier, the order is not designed to provide the context for anything subversive to happen in relation to the devolution settlement. It is a straightforward measure that seeks, in the vast
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
changes that have been made to the United Kingdom constitution in relation to Ireland, England and Scotland, to make that a definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one further point, which the Minister touched on. If there is an error in the calculations, will the methodology be dominant or will the order have to be removed and retabled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That strikes a pessimistic note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is based on experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All orders relating to important matters that come before the House have been well considered and thought through. We are not tempted to build mistakes into an Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point raised in relation to changing boundaries in future referred to sand banks that may emerge with Radio Caroline masts emerging from them. It would be silly to take that on board as a serious question. We do not expect worldwide climatic changes to result. Suffice it to say, that we are content that the co-ordinates have been well worked out to provide an interpretation of what we intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my comments will reassure hon. Members that this is a sensible order. It is part of the devolution settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want genuinely, for once, to help the Minister. Does he really want to make the statement that he has just made? Does he realise the effect that it will have in court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Opposition doubt what we are doing and saying, that is very unusual. At least they should accept that what we are doing is sensible Government business. We are not creating anything that tries to subvert any wider aspirations that Conservative Members may have. It is simply an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The co-ordinates are clear. I am assured that they are correct to give us a definition and the boundary that we need. I cannot say much more than that in answer to the questions that have been posed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that with those helpful comments and the note, which will provide the context for the definition, and any other supporting matter, the Committee will accept the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
