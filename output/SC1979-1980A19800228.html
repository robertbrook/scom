	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Leadbitter, because I was about to say that amendment No. 82 deals with a rather separate matter from the earlier amendments Nos. 79, 80 and 81, and No. 94 again deals with something rather different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an extremely valuable debate on Tuesday on the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). It enabled us to discuss the general priciples of the clause and the extent to which there will be a statutory provision for exemptions from union membership agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that we are on a difficult and highly sensitive question. We are talking about the ground that shall be prescribed in law for claiming unfair dismissal where that dismissal arises from the operation of a union membership agreement. I quoted at some length from an official Government document—I say "Official Government document" but I should make clear that it was a document which came from the Labour Administration, not the present one—which I thought made out a powerful argument in favour of what is described as the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When making those quotations, I said that I thought that the document expressed a harder position than I should myself adopt. I think that that is true. I have never regarded the closed shop or union membership agreements as an essential article of my faith in the trade union movement and its purposes. As a Minister, when this issue has been before the House, I have repeatedly asked that union membership agreements be applied with flexibility and tolerance, in the way that they have operated in many industries for many years. I have on at least one occasion given examples of what I felt was an intolerant application of the idea of the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1974 Act was deliberately framed in terms that would allow closed shops or union membership agreements to be operated in that flexible and tolerant way. I doubt that what I have described as a difficult and sensitive matter is best dealt with by statutory provision, by writing into the law how that flexibility and tolerance should be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have repeatedly stressed—I have done so, in particular— that there are many examples of conduct that we should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
wish to be otherwise in industrial relations. But we believe—certainly, I believe—that the change in behaviour that we seek will not be brought about by changing the law, introducing law or tinkering with the law. It is a change that will be best achieved by the common sense and wisdom of those who are actively engaged, day in and day out, in the management of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last evening, in the Library, I refreshed my memory of a speech which I have quoted in the House in the past, made by a former Conservative Minister of Labour, the right hon. John Hare, as he was—now Lord Blakenham—to the Conservative Party conference in 1961. He said some wise things in response to what was then a clamour for the introduction of such changes and additions to the law as are embodied in this Bill. He said to those who were demanding the introduction of such a clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They are suggesting a surgical operation. The surgeon's knife is a drastic instrument. It often saves life, but it can often kill, despite the skill of the man who applies it. The slower process of the physician who advises a course of treatment to enable the patient's own body to overcome its infirmity is very often the better treatment.".</p></blockquote>
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"May I look at the alternative, and this, broadly speaking, is for the Government to assist not only the trade unions but also the employers to put their house in order and to establish a closer working partnership ߪ this, of course, has to be done not by passing Acts of Parliament—Acts of Parliament seldom make men good—but by persuasion and by constant appeal to common sense and to common interest.".</p></blockquote>
Further, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The employer must take the lead in securing better industrial relations and this, quite frankly, does not always happen.".</p></blockquote>
At the end, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we can put these matters right by some dramatic intervention, I should certainly want to do so. But you cannot deal with human problems like that. I believe that the painstaking, though unspectacular, way in which we are trying to remedy weaknesses in our industrial relations arrangements is most likely to produce results in the end, and therefore in general I am against legislation. The legislative answers are not really as easy as they are made out to be. Ultimately they can well lead to the sanction of sending thousands of men to gaol if they refuse to obey the law.".</p></blockquote>
That is what we have said many times in these and other debates—that, perhaps unintended and unexpected, but inexorably, the proposed changes in the law take us in the direction foreseen by the then Con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
servative Minister of Labour, who wisely advised against becoming involved in events and developments that would take us down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we, as it were, come up to date on that very point? Has my right hon. Friend seen the press reports today of yesterday's proceedings of the Select Committee on Employment? The chief constables were making on picketing broadly the same point as the one that he has quoted Lord Blakenham as having made. We shall no doubt discuss that at a later stage, but it is pertinent to what my right hon. Friend has just said. They are saying that these precipitate changes in the law are not the way to go about these matters. Indeed, they went further. They said that they saw no role for them even in implementing the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that the Select Committee was to have the chief constables giving evidence yesterday, and I am sure that every member of the Committee will study with interest what they said, because it will be relevant to our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I quote again from the speech of Lord Blakenham, the right hon. John Hare as he then was. He finished his speech to the Conservative Party conference by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If this policy on which we have embarked fails, then of course they are right; legislation may well be the only answer. But, in my opinion, this would be a tragic day that would divide and weaken our free society, and I pray that it does not come.".</p></blockquote>
Then we read that the resolution was put to the conference and, after those words of John Hare, was defeated by an overwhelming majority. What a pity that those words of 19 years ago were not delivered before the present Government produced this legislation and did what he feared, ushering in the tragic day that he prayed would not come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those words as background, I turn to the specific proposals in our amendments. The first one, to insert the word "genuinely", is a logical consequence of what is contained in the 1974 Act, where Parliament in its wisdom, when it made provision for exemption on religious grounds in schedule I to that Act, chose to insert the word "genuine" against "religious belief". The then Government considered it right and sensible to accept
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
the wish of Parliament that we should make provision for those who objected to participation in a union membership agreement because of religious belief, because we thought that such beliefs might be testable against certain external criteria and standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us right up against the difficulty embodied in the present clause—the widening to embrace conscience and conviction, which are entirely subjective matters that cannot be tested, I submit, against any external criteria. How can we know what is within the heart and mind of another individual, and how can an industrial tribunal question and examine what may be within the heart and mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw that the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State at our last sitting had before him a document, which I believe has been sent to every member of the Committee, from the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. I urge every member of the Committee to read carefully what that body says. It says that judicial bodies will for the first time be brought into testing a person's personal beliefs. I shall quote from the document. To be fair to the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, it is using the argument for a different purpose, but the argument is still valid:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fundamental problem with conscience is that it is personal and not always entirely rational. This presents real difficulties in determining borderline cases. Although the onus will be upon the employee to demonstrate conscientious objections, if he makes a statement under oath that he has such an objection, it will presumably be up to either members of the tribunal or to the employer to question this statement.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will introduce a virtually unknown element into legal proceedings. The entire thrust of English law has been to avoid questioning a man's beliefs. Even in the times of religious persecution the law was concerned with action, not thoughts. Thus a person could be punished for attending a mass, for not attending a Church of England service, for not taking an oath. The law did not question the man's beliefs. To illustrate this point, Sir Nicholas Shireburn, a Lancastrian recusant, attended Protestant services with cotton wool stuffed in his ears to avoid being fined. What is now proposed is that a belief's be proved.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This has of course been done in the case of conscientious objections to military service—but circumstances were very special and tribunals were only answerable to Ministers, not subject to appeal or review by the European Court.".</p></blockquote>
That is another matter on which we touched at our last sitting.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the Abortion Act, there is a conscience loophole. This has led to doctors with conscientious objections to abortion not being appointed to certain positions … There can be no doubt
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
that some firms will likewise seek to avoid employing persons who might develop a conscientious objections to union membership just as they now screen potential recruits with a view to minimising cases of unfair dismissal for other reasons.".</p></blockquote>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The end product of this particular provision is likely to be a great deal of trouble without achieving very effective protection.".</p></blockquote>
To be fair—I do not want it to complain that I have misrepresented it—the association is arguing for something that in its view would be more far-reaching than what the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may quote a little further from earlier passages of the document, because it is closely relevant. Having referred to the serious problems which, in the association's view, will arise from these provisions of the Bill, it says that the proponents of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the approach contained in the Bill are replying on two propositions:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"1. that there will not be a large number of cases. This view is based on the following asumptions:

	<ol>

	<li>"that the number of persons acquiring a conscientious objection will be limited. This assumption rests upon the evidence that only a limited number of people resort to the protection which existed under the Industrial Relations Act and the 1974 Act. This assessment ignores the growth of union beatliness in certain areas—e.g. the Charing Cross Hospital pickets …</li>

	<li>"that persons coerced under the 1976 Amendment Act will not seek to leave their union; this is a most dubious assumption. It cannot be the case that no one who has joined a union is debarred from arguing that he has a deeply held personal conviction of conscientious objection—it is not axiomatic that it would be right for a person to inflict hardship on his family by giving up his job, even though he objected to joining a union: anyone in such a position is faced with a choice between evils. Even where there is no such choice between moral evils, a person could truthfully claim that he had a conscientious objection but had not acted on it. The problem of 'knowing right but doing wrong' is after all one of the oldest riddles in Western philosophy and it would be surprising, to say the least, if tribunals were to answer a question which has taxed the greatest philosophers for twenty-five centuries. To deny the right to an individual to repent of a wrong action would of course be to fly in the face of the entire Christian tradition.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
So the Association of British Chambers of Commerce is arguing that it is not sufficient to assume that anybody who is in an existing union membership agreement does not have a deeply held personal conviction or a conscientious objection that he might retrospectively want to invoke when these provisions are enacted. It goes on to say that the second assumption of those who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
support the approach embodied in the Bill is
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it will in practice be possible to recognise conscience when it appears. The analogy which is sometimes drawn is with an elephant. When an elephant appears, it is not difficult to recognise it. The problem here is that there is no great incentive for persons to make a fraudulent claim that something is an elephant. The same is not true in this case. The incentive to make such claims might be reduced were there to be a provision for persons obtaining exemption on grounds of conscience paying money to charity. But even then there would be real problems.".</p></blockquote>
So it goes on. I shall return in a moment to the point about the incentive. These are the difficulties against which our amendments Nos. 78, 79, 80, 81 and 82 are directed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunals will not only have the greatest difficulty in identifying, in establishing and in recognising a deeply held, sincere, personal conviction or conscientious objection. I draw attention here to the terms of amendment No. 90. Even where there is established a genuine conscientious objection, the tribunal, I assume, will have to take into account the extent to which that kind of objection, manifestly sincerely held, is relevant to the purposes of the union membership agreement and the trade union, and whether it is relevant to the relationships between the union and its members and the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example. I should be bitterly opposed to any attempt to reintroduce capital punishment into our law, but it might be that my trade union, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers—this is hypothetical and most unlikely—could pass a resolution at its annual national committee meeting, the policy-making body of my union, that my union wished capital punishment to be reintroduced. I suppose that then, if I was a member not employed in the House of Commons but in a workshop, I could say that I could in no way be a member of an organisation that stood for and aimed to achieve something that was basically irreconcilable with my conscience and beliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that hypothetical situation, I wonder what a tribunal would say. I have manifestly demonstrated by my votes in the House of Commons and my public utterances that I have a fundamental objection on grounds of conscience to that policy. If I were to say that for that reason I wished to have exemption from a closed shop and from membership of the union,
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
what would the tribunal say? Would it have to consider the relevance of that objection to the purposes and functions of the union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned capital punishment, but the Association of British Chambers of Commerce referred to abortion, so what I am saying is not so abstruse or hypothetical. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One point which it might be wise to take into account is the possibility of either the TUC or individual trade unions adopting policies on abortion which lead to large-scale defection. The TUC policy on abortion has already provoked condemnation from the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster. One question which we submit should be investigated is whether there might come a point where some act of the TUC was such that membership of unions affiliated to the TUC was no longer in accordance with people's principles. There are some actual cases of people deciding to leave their union on precisely this ground, but so far numbers are limited. The consequences for the operation of clause 6 of the Employment Bill of large-scale defections provoked by a TUC policy on an issue could be not inconsiderable.".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will argue that I am anticipating isolated cases that should in no way disrupt the general pattern of the bargaining arrangements in a particular situation. But the Association of British Chambers of Commerce sees the matter quite differently. This is highly relevant to that part of the Bill to which our amendment No. 82 is directed. In the new subsection (3A) we have the provision:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The dismissal of an employee in the circumstances set out in subsection (3) shall be regarded as unfair if he objects on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction to being a member of any trade union whatsoever or of a particular trade union."</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Gentleman will be familiar with the point, because the Engineering Employers' Federation and we in this Committee have expressed alarm at what may happen if that provision is enacted. My right hon. Friend quoted from the letter from the EEF at our last sitting. The hon. and learned Gentleman may already have said to the EEF, as I am sure he will put to the Committee, what I have just said, that there will be isolated cases which, by their infrequency and limited number, should not have any harmful impact on the pattern of bargaining arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to consider what the EEF has said and to contemplate the possibility of such large defections and the inevitable effect that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0920">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
that will have in disruption of existing stable bargaining arrangements and the way it may take us down the path towards the fragmentation of collective bargaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until our last sitting on Tuesday, I thought that there was one matter that was probably common ground in the Committee—that one weakness of our industrial relations system and of the trade union movement is that we have too many trade unions. I am not saying that there should never be any new trade unions, or that we have too many trade unionists—on the contrary—but I thought that one of the weaknesses that we had recognised was that there were perhaps too many trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "until Tuesday" because I recall the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), who unfortunately is not in his place, suggesting or complaining on Tuesday that because of the relative size of some of the bigger unions, in practice about 16 unions tended to dominate the whole scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People used to—and still do—hold as one of the virtues and strengths of the German industrial system that in Germany the unions are numbered only in 'teens—some 14 or 16 of them. I remember well a party of German industrial correspondents coming to interview me at the Department of Employment at the time when a particular dispute hit the headlines, the Ferrybridge Six, as they were described. The German correspondents said to me "Minister, is it not rather outrageous that a group of men should be denied the right to join a union of their own free choice?". We had a lengthy discussion about it and then moved on to other matters. The same industrial correspondents said to me "Is not one of the weaknesses of your trade union movement the fact that you have too many trade unions? Look how few we have in Germany." I had to say to them "You chaps must make up your minds." A great many people in this country are in that position. They must make up their minds. They have split personalities about this, and I fear sometimes that hon. Gentlemen have split personalities about it, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw ready nods of agreement when I said that we had too many trade unions. I am sure that those hon. Members would have nodded equally if I had asserted the right of an individual to join any trade union of his choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or to start a fresh one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. But hon. Members opposite cannot have it both ways. The Ferrybridge Six—I make no criticism of the individuals concerned; I do not know them and cannot recall sufficient of the details of the case—would have had an open door to set up their new trade union, which would have been harmful and disruptive to existing industrial relations in the electricity supply industry, which I understand has a very good record of industrial relations but which I am sure it would not continue to have if these provisions were enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of other groups which would dearly love to set up their own unions because, being in a German-style union at present, they feel that their particular sectional interest is often overlooked in the generality of the union concerned about the totality of its membership. For example, I think of the coal mining industry. My right hon. Friend will be well aware of the dispute that festered for years in the Yorkshire coalfield when the chaps who operated the winding machinery which takes the cages up and down the shaft felt that they were special workers who ought to have a separate union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said often enough that I worked in the engineering industry as a toolmaker. Toolmakers often feel that, because of the vast scope of the membership of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, their special expertise and the reward that they ought to have for it is overlooked. They sought to set up a National Association of Toolmakers, which, I think, still exists. On the railways, the signalmen feel that they are a special case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will tell me that the fact that people want to set up a special union because they feel that they are something special has nothing to do with this question, which is all about conscience and deeply held personal conviction. But, as the Engineering Employers' Federation has pointed out, it may not be like that at all. There can be these defections on bogus grounds of conviction aimed at the ulterior objective of ensuring that their special bargaining position gets the special treatment which they, rightly or wrongly, wisely or otherwise, think it ought to have. It is not as hypothetical as that.

I turn now to one other point, and the Association of British Chambers of Com-

	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
merce has already touched on it—the question of incentive. We must all be glad that the Government are not proposing that in these circumstances the employer shall be compelled to keep on the person who is or will become a non-unionist and therefore, perhaps, harmful in industrial relations terms. What the Government are saying is that that employer can then buy his way out of trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to the point which the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) wisely made in his article in 
	<i>The Times,</i> where he echoed the view of his hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman), that the law, if it is to be effective, must command at least the tacit acceptance of those to whom it applies. Given the reality of the industrial relations situation, where an individual has appealed to a tribunal under the new provisions and done so successfully so that he is freed of his obligation to pay his contributions to the union or join another union which is unnacceptable, whichever the case may be, there may well be those who say that they cannot be compelled to work with someone who is wholly objectionable to them, whose presence may be prejudicial to their safety, and they may still refuse to work with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is now proposed is that that non-trade unionists shall be able to obtain compensation. If he has worked with his employer for a substantial period and is dismissed in these circumstances, he may well be eligible for the large sums of money to which we referred earlier. What is that amount now? The hon. and learned Gentleman will perhaps jog my memory. I think the maximum is now £16,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it has never been reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says that it has never been reached. None the less, these are substantial sums of money which might be very tempting for some people to chance their arm and suddenly find that they have a conscientious objection or deeply held personal conviction that they have never manifested before. Because they never had any reason to parade it before, since there was no benefit, they did not do so, but now the law will provide them with an opportunity to display their conscience,
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
secretly hoping all the time that the tribunal will uphold them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chaps in the shop will not be acting unlawfully if they say that, notwithstanding what the tribunal has said, the chap is so repugnant to them, and, in certain situations, prejudicial to their safety, that they cannot work with him and they have a right to choose with whom they shall work. They may even threaten to withdraw their labour. In that situation, the employer may be taken to the tribunal again or may save himself the trouble and say that, as he will have to fork out compensation, it may as well be totted up now and he will pay him the £X,000. If that happens, many others will be tempted in that way. It is not so unreal. It happens already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the case of my constituent, Mr. Arthur Boughey, who was dismissed for his trade union activities—I say that, but his employer said that he was redundant. I understand that Mr. Boughey and his 13 colleagues who were dismissed with him have been offered several thousand pounds by their former employer to shut up and forget all about it. That may well happen here. There is now the financial nexus and incentive to take advantage of these provisions and drop out of the trade union. That is a recipe for bad industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken perhaps for longer than I ought, and certainly for longer than I had intended, but there are several amendments here, each of which deals in a rather separate way with our concerns and objections to the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that, if it is desired, there can be separate Divisions on amendments Nos. 94 and 82.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can offer a little help to my right hon. Friend in the difficulty that he stumbled across with the word "recusant". If he cares to wander a few yards along the corridor and into another Committee room where another Standing Committee is considering another Bill, he will see a living example of this species in the form of the right hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Prentice).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitude which the hon. and learned Gentleman will take to this group of amenments will be the acid test of the Government's intentions and the degree of their sincerity in relation to the clause. It will be an acid test of whether they seek to protect the odd individual who has some deep
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
religious or similar conviction, or whether their real interest is to provide aid and comfort to a body of scrimshankers whose only objective in claiming conscience is to get the benefits of trade unionism without shouldering the obligations thereof and who will seek to weaken the trade union movement as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, I look forward with bated breath to hearing whether the hon. and learned Gentleman will ask his hon. Friends to oppose the amendment which seeks to insert the word "genuinely".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is terribly bad for the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) to bate his breath. Therefore I take the opportunity, as I have indicated to his right hon. Friend, to say now that the Government are prepared to accept the amendment on "genuinely", not because it adds to the legal effect of the clause but because we understand, for some of the reasons given by the right hon. Gentleman, that it may give a firmer steer to the tribunal as to what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was rightly pointed out by the right hon. Gentleman in his valuable speech, the word was employed in the 1974 Act and in an earlier statute. I can put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. We think that there are proper grounds for accepting the amendment, and I thought that it would be helpful to say so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful, and I am much obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman for truncating what might have been a waste of words, and for his deep concern for my pulmonary health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But accepting that one amendment does not cover the whole ground. The bona fides of the purposes behind the clause are still very much open to criticism. We shall see whether those purposes are the beneficent ones that they are pretended to be or the malevolent ones that we suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend said, conscience is a difficult thing to define and it is a difficult thing to judge, for all the reasons that he gave—reasons that were powerfully reinforced by the impressive passages which he quoted. We had a similar problem with regard to conscientious objection to military service. We dealt with that by seeking to provide that a man must establish the genuineness of his conscientious objection not before a court of law but before a very different body—a body the membership and procedures of which were
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
specifically designed ad hoc to deal with the examination of the genuineness of a claimed conscientious conviction. The membership and procedures of the tribunal were tailored ad hoc to that single question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An industrial tribunal is not, by a long chalk, tailored ad hoc to this single question. The qualifications which we require for membership of an industrial tribunal are different and the procedures are different, for good reasons. They are tailored to the job that the industrial tribunal has to carry out. If we were to make provision for conscientious objection—it is common ground that some provision must exist—the best way to deal with it would be to set up a separate tribunal along the lines of the tribunals that dealt with conscientious objection to military service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I drop that idea in front of the hon. and learned Gentleman for him to ponder upon with the open-mindedness which he has exhibited in the Committee. It might be difficult now to introduce such a provision into the Bill, though I do not think it impossible. Doubtless, an additional schedule would be required for the detail of the organisation and operation of the tribunal. There can never be an objective test of conscience, but that is the way in which we shall come nearest to one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that such a tribunal would be able to say anything about "deeply held personal conviction"? That is perhaps even more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is. I do not think that it could say with absolute certainty. The conscientious objectors tribunals on military service never claimed to be infallible in their judgments. Indeed, there were many objections to the way in which they worked and to individual decisions which they took.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let us start with the premise that there is no way in which to get this 100 per cent. right, for all the reasons which my right hon. Friend gave. All that we can do is try to get it as nearly right as possible. An examining body whose personnel are selected and whose procedures are constructed ad hoc to deal with this single question is a bit more likely to get at the truth in a somewhat higher proportion of cases than is an industrial tribunal manned and structured against quite different criteria to meet a quite different objective.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
I invite the hon. and learned Gentleman to give some thought to that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to present my amendment No. 94. It is intended to ensure that employees with personal responsibilities, often responsibilities created by legislation—for example, in health and safety—and who are subject to the code of conduct of a professional body should have an absolute statutory right to be excluded from a closed-shop arrangement. That is the object of the amendment, and I make no secret of the fact that, as I am sure hon. Members are aware, this situation has given rise to some serious concern to bodies such as the Royal Institute of Chemistry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work of management and professional staff often carries with it a potential for conflict of interest between responsibilities of professional employees to their professions as opposed to their trade unions. For example, a member of a professional body instructed by that body, possibly because of the terms of its own Royal charter, to carry out a certain function to protect the health of people could at the same time, because he was a member of a trade union, be instructed to strike. He might well say "I am not prepared to strike because my professional body requires me not to do so". He would have the difficulty of deciding whether to obey the instructions of his trade union or the instructions of his professional body. I have tabled my amendment because of the creation of that type of situation which could arise in a closed-shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's intention to protect certain groups against dismissal—certainly, their conscience clause seems to indicate that that is their intention—and I should have thought therefore that it was not improper unwise to include certain categories in the Bill and to specify those categories for the benefit of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Institute of Chemistry is a body that has professional standards and a professional code. I use that body, therefore, as the example on which to hang my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any person, while a member of the Institute of Chemistry, is held by the council of that institute to have been guilty of any act or default discreditable to the profession of chemistry, he is liable to be excluded from membership of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
professional body. Certain employees are licensed by legislation to hold posts which require possession of a given professional qualification. For example, a public analyst falls into that category, and there are other examples in the chemical industry and the profession of chemistry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional employees who are licensed by specific legislation to hold certain posts and who at the same time are committed as union members by virtue of closed-shop agreements can be faced with serious dilemmas if they are instructed in an industrial dispute to do one thing by their union and another by their professional body. They could therefore risk falling foul of their professional body and thereby invoking the disciplinary machinery of that body or, alternatively, of falling foul of their union, being expelled from the union and, as a consequence of the closed shop agreement, losing their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that my amendment seeks to do therefore is to say that, where an individual is a member of a recognised professional body, he shall be excused by statute from belonging to a trade union under a closed shop agreement and shall have the right to refuse to belong to the union in that situation. It is a valuable amendment which would protect a small but important minority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments raises fundamental issues. We have already had a valuable debate, with a valuable and helpful speech from the right hon. Member from Doncaster (Mr. Walker). I have already said that the Government are content to accept the first amendment because, although we do not believe it to be necessary to the draftsmanship of the subsection to add the word "genuinely", we recognise that it does give a firmer steer to industrial tribunals which will have the job of enforcing it. If we add the word "genuinely" it emphasises that the burden lies upon the claimant who is asking for compensation for unfair dismissal to satisfy the tribunal not that he has some transient whim but that he has a genuine objection which is based upon grounds of conscience or other deeply held personal conviction. Therefore, that is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that again at the risk of wearying the Committee by saying things twice because it is indicative of the Government's approach to this whole question of conscience. We think that it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0924">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
common ground on both sides of the Committee, and also, we believe, in industry and the country, that there should be some exemption from the operation of section 58 of the 1978 Act, which says that one shall not have any compensation if one is dismissed where there is a closed shop agreement if the grounds for dismissal are that one does not belong to the union which is party to the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us recognise that there must be some relaxation of that in what is often rather unhelpfully called in the courts a proper case. That is a question-begging formula. What is a proper case? It is a very convenient formula. We have all recognised that a religious objection shall be a proper case. The question really is whether that should be widened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 has this effect. It says that the provision in the clause shall apply if a person genuinely objects for reasons of "religious belief or proven grounds of" conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take religious belief first. My understanding and belief, irrespective of the advice I receive, is that it is unnecessary to include those words. One cannot conceive of religious belief which is also not binding in-conscience, and a ground of conscience must always therefore embrace a ground of religious belief. So that would not be necessary. If that were the only objection, I should not be pressing it, because it might make the clause clearer, but to go on as the amendment does to say "or proven grounds of conscience or other deeply held personal conviction" would give rise to real difficulty. That is unnecessary, too, but it gives rise to difficulty because it might very well mislead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of proving that he is entitled to this exemption must always rest upon the claimant. To say that really shows the ground for objecting to this part of the amendment. In order to show that one has such a belief, one has to prove it. Standards of proof vary in the courts. As everybody knows, in the criminal courts the onus of proof rests upon the prosecution, and the standard is that it must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt. But in the civil courts and in the tribunals, where a burden of proof rests upon the claimant, the standard is much less heavy. The claimant or plaintiff has to show proof on the balance of the probabilities. But he cannot show anything without proving it. Therefore, it is unnecessary to add the words "on proven grounds"; he does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
establish his grounds unless he has proof of them, according to whatever the right standard of proof is—in the case, on the balance of the probabilities—and 51 per cent. is enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the amendment is not necessary. It is also potentially misleading. If this were imported into the clause, what implication would arise in other clauses where a burden of proof is imposed and is discharged only if one establishes certain things on certain grounds? The word "proven" is not there. The implication then is that Parliament must have intended something to have derived from the insertion of this word "proven", and might it perhaps be some heavier standard of proof? Of course, it is not. So it is unnecessary and also potentially misleading. I hope that I need say no more about that. It is a relatively marginal matter, and I hope that the Committee will accept those arguments in resistance to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The meat of this group of amendments comes in Nos. 80 to 82 and No. 94, to which the hon. Member of Rochdale (Mr. Smith) has just spoken. I for one have great sympathy with amendment No. 94 and will return to it in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the Government's approach to this part of the group of amendments is this. If there is any case for a conscience clause at all exempting a person from the consequences of not belonging to a union where there is a closed shop agreement, whether that exemption be limited to religious objection, as the law is now expressed, or whether it be widened in the terms of the Bill as drafted, we believe that there is no moral ground for saying that the objection must extend to joining any union at all. To say that it must not cover joining any particular union is not good enough. There may be practical and political reasons, and they have been explored by the right hon. Gentleman and others—questions of fragmentation of unions and so on, which I understand and shall deal with it later—but there can be no moral ground, we believe, for saying that there shall be a conscience clause but it must on moral grounds be limited to an objection to joining any union at all rather than any particular union. I believe that to be axiomatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the root of the issue which is thrown up by amendments Nos. 80 to 82 and No. 94 is to be found in the question whether there should be any provision for a conscience objection. It is common
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
ground in the Committee, I think and certainly in the House, that there ought to be a conscience let-out, if I may so call it, and I can point to a very respectable pedigree for that proposition. The Donovan commission believed that an employee who had
	<br><blockquote><p>"conscientious or other reasonable grounds for refusing to join the union".</p></blockquote>
which was party to a closed shop agreement should have a right to complain of unfair dismissal. The words are "conscientious or other reasonable grounds".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1969 White Paper "In Place of Strife", that point was picked up:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before agreeing to a closed shop employers should seek to obtain suitable protection for people who refuse to join trade unions on conscientious grounds.".</p></blockquote>
It recommended that such people should be protected by the general unfair dismissal provisions which it was proposed to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come on to the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, where a Liberal amendment, as hon. Members will remember, was supported by the Conservatives and resulted in the Act saying that those with objections on grounds of religious belief to membership of any trade union whatsoever and those who objected on any reasonable grounds to being a member of a particular trade union should be entitled to compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was in the 1974 Act. But when the Labour Government returned with a majority—albeit it a slender one—and could do more of the things they wanted, in 1976 they did not abolish the whole conscience exemption. They left it on religious grounds, and that is the law today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I contend that it is common ground that there must be some right of conscientious objection—some ability to claim compensation for unfair dismissal if the reason for dismissal was an objection based on some ground of conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is right and I carry the Committee with me thus far, the question becomes: how wide should that conscientious ground be drawn? I take it from the amendments that it is common ground that the conscientious objection should be capable of being wider than it is at present, because none of them seeks to take the law
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
back to what it is at present and confine the conscientious objection to one based on religion. That is reinforced, I think, by what the trade unions have said. The TUC's advice in its guidance originally attached to the agreement made with the previous Government in February 1979 implicitly admitted that the religious exemption was too narrow. The guide says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be recognised that for many years, unions, voluntarily and without any legal requirement, have made provision for conscientious objectors to be excluded from the closed shop provisions, but in some cases on the understanding that they make an equivalent payment to charity.".</p></blockquote>
That, I understand, is the subject of an amendment my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has put down. The guide goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the previous paragraphs show, the closed shop need not be a rigid arrangement. Its scope can be as flexible as the parties concerned wish it to be and unions might bear this firmly in mind."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And do, as the hon. Member says. If that is not a fairly firm steer from the TUC, I do not know what is. It is a steer towards the proposition that conscience clauses are proper and ought to be wider than those based solely upon religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the question is how wide should they be, perhaps it would be helpful to begin by saying what they ought not extend to. They certainly ought not to extend to what is trivial or transient, insubstantial or of a passing character, or however one likes to put it. This new exemption which the clause provides for is not intended to cover those with trivial, superficial or transitory objections to union membership. We could all, I suppose, think of examples. I think of those who are temporarily disaffected by the union leadership. Nor is the new exemption intended to cover those whose objection stems from calculations of financial advantage, who do not like the way the subscription has gone up, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the final analysis, it will be for a tribunal to determine on the facts of any particular case whether an individual's objections to union membership constitute grounds of conscience or other deeply held personal conviction. I go back to what I said about our decision to accept the word "genuinely". That is indicative of our approach to the whole of the clause, because, at the end of the day, one must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0926">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
trust the tribunal that Parliament has set up, experienced in the industrial context, to use its common sense and to derive the intention of Parliament from the statute. We believe that a tribunal will not in practice have difficulty in determining whether there is a ground of conscience or a deeply held conviction in the circumstances likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In widening the current religious exemption in the way the clause does, we do not intend that leeway should be given to any sort of spurious objection that could result in industrial disruption by the undermining of well established agreements. We believe that the intention is made clear in the clause. That is what it is not intended to deal with, and that is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to what a conscience clause, in the Government's belief, ought to extend to. At the centre of the Governments philosophy on the clause is the notion that the individual's objection must always be based on personal conviction, a conviction that is deeply held, not one that is toyed with or picked up experimentally but deeply held. Hitherto, only religious grounds have qualified, and certainly all religious grounds must continue to qualify —none of us would disagree with that— provided that they are religious grounds which, in the words that we have adopted, are sincerely, deeply and genuinely held and not picked up for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all deeply held convictions which are binding on conscience are religious in nature. Not all convictions that are deeply held are based on religion. It is the quality of being binding in conscience by virtue of a conviction that is deeply held that the Government wish first to identify as a proper ground for this exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference to the concept of religion guides the mind towards the concept of conscience. If religious objection alone is specified, as the law at present stands, as qualifying for this right, the implication can arise that non-religious or secular considerations, however deeply they may influence the claimant and however deeply they may bear upon his conscience, are intended to be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is by no means the Government's intention. Nor could it be the intention of any reasonable person to exclude the secular. All grounds of objection which are dictated by conscience by reason of conviction that is not shallow or ephemeral but deeply held ought to qualify. All grounds of religious objection are grounds
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
of conscience but not all grounds of conscience are in character religious. So we believe that "conscience" should be substituted for "religion" because the greater includes the less. It takes nothing away but adds what is desirable to be added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One comes now into a little difficulty, based upon the word "conscience", and in part upon decided cases, of which there are only a few. Conscience can be defined narrowly or widely. If conscience were to be used alone, with nothing to follow it in the clause, there could be uncertainty about what was intended. Conscience has been held to have necessary connotations of religion—rather surprisingly to me. The Government wish to avoid suggesting that, in order to qualify, the objection must be tied to religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make no mention now in the clause of religion or of conscience would give rise to uncertainty to the public, to tribunals and to unions. "What was intended?" would be the question. "They used to have 'religion'in. That has been taken out. Nothing else has been put in about conscience. Is the intention to reject religious objection as a ground? What about conscience?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Uncertainty can arise for another reason. It might be argued that an objection on grounds that the policy of the union would involve a member in conflict with his occupational, professional, vocational or even statutory duty was not, strictly construed, an objection of conscience—that it was binding upon him but not an objection of conscience. Yet that kind of objection certainly ought to qualify for exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore in order to defeat that possible suggestion that "conscience" has to be inserted into the clause, and it is in order to avoid uncertainty that we add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other deeply-held personal conviction".</p></blockquote>
giving clear guidance to tribunals that, in order to qualify, the objection must be based on a conviction that is deeply held. That may include a ground of conscience, and in most cases would. Indeed, it is difficult, though not impossible, to think of a case which would not actually bear upon conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the formulation in amendment No. 80—
	<br><blockquote><p>"religious, moral or ethical convictions".</p></blockquote>
What about that as an alternative? The dffiiculty is that it is less clear. What is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0927">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
distinction, for example, between "moral" and "ethical"? Can one expect an industrial tribunal to be able to draw the line with certainty between a moral objection and an ethical one? Is there not a religious connotation to "moral"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is there any requirement in amendment No. 80 that the objection must be deeply held. I agree that "genuine" would apply. But this is not easy meat for the tribunals. It is easier to recognise a conscientious objection or other deeply held personal conviction than it is to distinguish whether there is a moral, religious or ethical objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may say so without seeming patronising, it is not too bad but it is not clear enough. Conscience embraces all these concepts—moral, ethical or religious—and deeply held personal conviction. The wording in the clause gives a firmer and easier steer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman consider this example? The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) made the point on Tuesday that a number of trade unions have the clear objective written into their constitutions of establishing a Socialist society. I am personally glad about that, but the hon. and learned Gentleman and many of his hon. Friends will not like it. Let us suppose that they were members of a trade union. Clearly, they would have a deeply held personal conviction that that was a wrong objective. Would that provide grounds for the tribunal to say "Yes, you ought to be exempt from the obligation to join that union in the union membership agreement?" That is not a religious, moral or ethical conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in each case a question of fact for the tribunal to determine whether there is a deeply held personal conviction. The chances of being able to establish it will in some cases be strong. If one can show that one has been a member of whatever church it is that says that one must not be yoked with the ungodly and that one goes there every Sunday—or every Saturday, or whenever it is—that is probably the highest chance that one has of establishing it. One can think of circumstances going right the way down the scale until there is a very slender chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in the instance that the right hon. Gentleman has given, it is arguable that
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
there would be a moral objection to supporting a union whose purpose was to further the cause and development of Socialism. There can be those who take the view that that is morally objectionable. In answer to the right hon. Gentleman's question, I say that that could be caught by his formulation in amendment No. 80. It could be caught in certain circumstances. One cannot in law say otherwise. It could be caught by the Government's formulation in the subsection. Questions of whether the chance is substantial, slender or slight as to be almost out of sight depend on the facts in each case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is very kind to sit down and give me a chance to put my difficulties to him. His argument has been circular. The definition of "personal conviction" for which I have been waiting is circular, because it goes back to conscience, and he defines conscience in terms of personal conviction. So I am left in a confused position, going round in circles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second problem is how on earth an industrial tribunal can judge the depth of someone's personal conviction. Again I am left confused. Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will deal with those two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the first point. I indicated as much when I said it is very difficult to think of an objection based upon deeply held personal convictions that was not one of conscience. But I suppose that there are some. For example, if a local authority chemist is subject to certain statutory duties which conflict with his obligations deriving from membership of a union, it could be argued that that was not an objection of conscience but one which derived from statutory duty. It is not an awfully good argument, but I see that it could be set up. It is in order to avoid that kind of difficulty that we add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other deeply held personal conviction".</p></blockquote>
But it broadly turns on conscience. The hon. Gentleman is right. I am not deterred by that, nor, I think, would be the ordinary people forming the panels on the industrial tribunals. One can distinguish a ground of conscience from a ground of expedience—a matter of political advantage, for example. These things tend to look much more formidable in the abstract than they do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
when one is called upon to apply a criterion to a given set of facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we had, under the 1974 Act, the really much wider criterion of reasonable grounds for not belonging to a particular union, there were—I speak from memory—23 cases heard by the tribunals during the period of some 16 months when that remained the law. Of those 23 cases, 16 were successful and the remainder were either withdrawn or were not successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the experience was that tribunals generally had little difficulty in seeing where to draw the line in each case. There were objections. In the Ferrybridge case, for example, the tribunal complained that not enough guidance or steer had been given by Parliament as to what was meant by "reasonable". That was a pretty fair objection. But it did not have great difficulty in deciding where to draw the line. We believe that here a better steer will be given. "Conscience" is defined. I do not improve the point by labouring it. Most of us can distinguish a ground of conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of how the tribunals decide the depth of conscience, I entirely take the right hon. Gentleman's point—that this involves looking into hearts and minds. But I depart sharply from what the Association of British Chambers of Commerce said in its breifing note—that this is a great departure. The vast majority of cases under the criminal law involve taking account of what is or was in the heart and mind of someone at a given time—often long ago. Here the tribunal is looking at what is in his heart and mind today, not at what was in it I0 months ago when he was accused of stealing in the supermarket. Was he stealing with guilty intent or was it really a matter of forgetfulness? This is not something from which the courts shy away. It would be impossible to have any sensible system of justice if it were otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if my hon. and learned Friend could confirm my understanding that dedication to a deeply-held political principle or precept is a matter of moral or conscientious grounds and that therefore it would be within the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that it would not in any case fall within the definition included in the Bill. Whether in any particular case it does is a matter of fact for the tribunal to determine based upon all
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
the evidence before it. As a matter of law, I do not believe that it is possible to say that the circumstance suggested by my hon. Friend must in all circumstances be outside the formula. But I can see that there would be great difficulty in certain cases and less difficulty in others. It is a matter for the tribunal to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) asks how the tribunal can judge the depth of a deeply-held personal conviction. The tribunal does not hold up a thermometer or depth gauge. It is a steer and it matches up with "genuinely" and the intention to which Parliament would be seen to be giving effect in that formula is that it must be the real McCoy. It must be something— as it says—"deeply-held", something fundamental, a matter of conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that Parliament helps by seeking to define concepts of that nature expressed in ordinary language by using other words to define them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the question is "What do you mean by the other word that you have used?" I believe in a rather colloquial form of draftsmanship. Far and away the best example that I know of in statute law since the war is the Occupiers' Liability Act I957, drafted in a splendidly free-flowing and colloquial way, which has given rise to no trouble of definition. Only two cases have ever been to the Court of Appeal on the basis of its meaning, and it is quite a long Act. The Court of Appeal has never had any difficulty in saying what it means. But I am afraid that that is rather a diversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to take so long but this is a fundamentally important point and I am trying to explain the Government's views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must turn to the remaining amendments—Nos. 81, 82 and 90. Amendment No. 81 simply leaves it at "conscience"; it leaves out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other deeply-held personal conviction".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 82 knocks out
	<br><blockquote><p>"of a particular trade union."</p></blockquote>
I have said what I want to say about that. Once it is agreed that there is place for a conscientious objection, I cannot conceive of any moral ground for excluding such an objection to belonging to a particular trade union, but I can see that there may be practical grounds. I shall come to those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like next to deal with what the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
said so concisely in moving amendment No. 94. He said that where a person had a statutory duty, he should be outwith the closed shop provisions altogether, and that if a person is sacked for not joining a union when he has a statutory obligation or duties imposed by statute deriving from his professional capacity, he should always be entitled to compensation for unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have very great sympathy with those reasons. But we believe that the right approach is not to make specific provision in this area, because this would create the risk of the legislations becoming cluttered with special provisions to the net detriment of the legislation as a whole. Clearly, where conscientious beliefs lead to a member of a profession refusing to be a member of a union, this will be supported by clause 6. But more important are the rights created by clause 3, with which we have already dealt, not to be excluded or expelled from a trade union. Where an individual feels that his or her professional ethics are not being properly considered, any disciplinary action taken against that individual can lead to expulsion and hence to a tribunal considering whether such expulsion is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Government do not feel that amendment No. 94 is necessary or that it offers the right solution to an acknowledged source of anxiety and concern. The code of practice on the closed shop will discuss general criteria regarding the reasonableness of a decision to exclude or expel an individual from a union, and consideration will certainly be given by the Government to including in the code of practice advice on the attention that ought to be paid to professional ethical codes and matters such as the hon. Gentleman has understandably and rightly drawn to our attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I come to the practical objections to allowing objections to any particular union. Whether the clause should apply only to objections to membership of any union whatsoever or extend to objections to membership of a particular union is something which the Government took seriously into Account, and they sought views on this in their working papers in July. Not surprisingly, the TUC found the narrowest formulation preferable, but some employers' organisations, including the EEF, were also inclined to counsel caution in this area. The right hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
Gentleman has mentioned that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the preponderant view favoured giving protection to conscientious objection to membership of a particular union, and there are good reasons for doing so. Why should an individual who finds that his union in a closed shop is adopting rules or policies which conflict with his conscientious belief in the performance, for example, of his occupational duty—which may include the saving of life—have to choose between not doing that duty or losing his job without any remedy being available to him? This is not likely to cause industrial disruption, as has been suggested. The numbers will, we believe, be small. The 1974 Act had a much wider exemption formula, and I have already drawn attention to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is it probable that this provision, when linked with the provisions of clause 3, will act to undermine the Bridlington procedure. This is what was left out of the right hon. Gentleman's speech when he spoke of fragmentation and of setting up new unions. If an employer refuses to accept a claim to keep somebody on and to allow him to form his own union, he will be perfectly entitled to rely upon Bridlington and to say that the dismissal was reasonable. Of course, the tribunals will have regard to Bridlington, and a code of practice will, I am certain, say something about this. But they would wish to do so anyway, because the criterion is whether it is reasonable to dismiss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a union membership agreement there will usually be just one union appropriate to a particular grade of employee. Therefore, a conscientious objector to a particular union would not, even if he wanted to join another union, normally have access to another union which would consider him for membership. In any case, should such a case arise, the tribunal, in considering such a case of exclusion on its merits, would weigh up all the relevant facts and any guidance in a code which was available and decide accordingly. We discussed these matters when we were talking about clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman spoke about the Ferrybridge case. It is worth recording that the decision in the Ferrybridge case, which went in favour of members of a breakaway union at the industrial tribunal, did not give them a right to set up their own union or to have it negotiate on their own behalf. They were already members of a breakaway union, and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
existing law does not prevent that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman relied heavily upon the objections set out by the chambers of commerce, with which I have had a fruitful and valuable meeting, as well as having had the advantage of their response to the working papers. I suggest that the same objections could be made to having any conscientious exemption at all, including a religious one. Everything that is said against the clause can equally be said against having a religious objection as a ground. The right hon. Gentleman says that there is a great incentive to be fraudulent. But what are we talking about? We are talking about a forum, a tribunal, which includes one representative of trade unionists, one representative of employers' organisations and a legally qualified chairman, and I do not believe that a tribunal with that degree of nous is likely to be taken in by a fraud. The burden is upon the claimant to show that he has a conscientious objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at it in practical terms. The existing employee does not have to show any reason. So all existing employees, at a time when a UMA is made, do not have to show that they come within clause 6. It is enough if they do not want to join. Then, whatever the reason, if they are sacked compensation is payable. We are talking about somebody who wants to come out of a union. The longer one has been in a union, the harder it must be to show that one has some deeply-held personal conviction against remaining in. It may be that one can show some change in the union's policy which gives rise to the objection; well and good. But it is not very easy to be fraudulent about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other class of person to whom this can apply is a new entrant to a post-entry closed shop. He says "Yes, I understand that if I am going to get this job I have got to join the union within a month." Very well. What happens? He does not join the union within a month. If he comes forward with some great claim to conscience, it will sit rather uneasily with the fact that he took the job in the first place, knowing what the conditions were. Also, it must not be forgotten that he will have no claim for unfair dismissal unless he has served for a year under the qualifying period. So that problem is not likely to arise in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
I hope that I have dealt with the points that have been raised in this very interesting debate. I have covered all of them, save the interesting suggestion made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). He did not suggest that there were no grounds for widening the conscience clause, and I was grateful to him for that. It reflected the realism which he brings to our proceedings. What he was saying was that this was a difficult job for an industrial tribunal, and he wondered whether we could not have something rather like the military conscientious objection tribunals which were established for that purpose alone. Against that, it is right to point out that the industrial tribunals are 
	<i>par excellence</i> familiar with the context in which this objection is made, which is the industrial context. That familiarity would not so readily be able to be found in a special tribunal set up along the lines that the hon. Gentleman suggests. But I understand the point and the way in which it is put, and I should like to consider it and not reach a firm decision on it here and now. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for having raised it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have gone on for so long. I am told that I have misled the Committee in my last point about closed shop dismissals. They are statutorily defined to be for an admissible reason, and thus no qualifying period is required. That was a bad point; I am sorry for it and I withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that has set out the reasons why the Government believe it right to resist these amendments, except for the one about "genuinely", and that it may have clarified the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's kindly attitude towards my amendment. He is a lawyer; I am not. I therefore must accept his advice as to how the law will apply to a case such as that which I outlined as a consequence of the Bill, assuming that it becomes law. I noted particularly his absolute promise to include some reference to this matter in codes of practice. Since those codes of practice, as I understand it, are now to be admissible in courts of law as evidence, I take his assurance with good grace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, between now and the Report stage, one could receive some sort of advice that was contrary legally to that which the Minister has enunciated this morning. I doubt whether one will, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0931">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
one could do. Subject to that reservation, I am satisfied with the Minister's assurances and I shall not seek to press my amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to tell the Under-Secretary, after listening carefully to his rather lengthy statement, that he has not assuaged my anxieties on this point. He has convinced me that clause 6 is either unnecessary, because it would be so minor, or that it would be very dangerous. As he has said, we can all understand the question of religious convictions and proof, because if one is a member of an organisation, one can prove that one is a member by practising its teaching and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Minister wants to widen the criteria. We then come down to what the criteria are. It was when he was dealing with this that the whole thing seemed to get more and more intricate, and the greater, it seemed to me, became the uncertainty of the whole thing. The reason I think it dangerous is that I believe that the Minister is leading himself into what will prove to be a legal quagmire which I suspect he may well come to regret. I wonder why the clause is here. I suspect the reasons for it are political. I do not think that anyone would disagree that part of the Conservative Party's appeal to the electorate in May was what might be called a union-bashing approach; certainly a very critical approach to the trade unions and, in particular, to the closed shop. Any criticism of the closed shop at the Conservative Party conference was always greeted with great applause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that setting, the viewpoint of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) has the merit of logic, and I am quite certain that if the Secretary of State went along to this year's Conservative Party conference and said that we had legislated to abolish the closed shop, there would be a stormy ovation leading to tumultuous applause. But we are not going to get that because that is impracticable. As practical men of affairs, we all know that. What we shall get is this nit-picking. We shall have this clause which will enable someone to go along to the Conservative Party conference and say "We have dealt with the closed shop by a system of pinpricks and by seemingly inviting and encouraging people to go to tribunals."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has appreciated the
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
disadvantages of encouraging people to hop from one trade union to another. That being so, why can he not accept our amendment? Without it, his scheme will upset the present voluntary machinery. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) spoke about toolmakers, and it is not all that long ago that the toolmakers at Leyland wanted separate negotiating rights for themselves. Surely this will encourage them to take that sort of approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) referred to the developments in technology which meant that small groups of people often had great power for example, those operating computers. What if those operating computers suddenly wondered why they should belong to a large union and why they should not form a union of a couple of hundred men so that they could hold a whole industry to ransom? This clause could encourage them to do precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not only my view. We have all been reading the matter that has been sent to us. Our reading has been quite wide and catholic. I should like to read a couple of paragraphs from the 
	<i>New Law Journal</i> of 10 January 1980, in which an eminent lawyer, Brian Capstick, had the following to say about this formulation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if … 'he objects on grounds of conscience of other deeply held personal conviction to being a member of any trade union whatsoever or of a particular trade union'. This may well be a popular proposal politically, but it poses tricky legal and industrial relations problems. Legally, whether or not someone has a conscience or conviction against union membership seems to be a barely justiciable issue. With the existing religious belief ' exception, it is usuatly possible to point to membership of a particular sect whose beliefs proscribe membership of any union as verifiable evidence, but no such objective proof is likely to be available in many 'personal conviction ' cases. How, moreover, would one deal legally or practically with the position of the convert, the existing member who developed a deeply held conviction only after a proposal to strike or to put up the subscription was made?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"From an industrial relations point of view, the fear is that if one allows objection to a particular union to be a ground for unfair dismissal, one then opens the door to potential `show piece' trials during recognition disputes, possibly by individuals carrying the torch for an unrecognised union. Experience suggests that such litigation tends to be protracted and unproductive, which perhaps outweighs any advantage which may accrue to genuinely motivated individuals. ft is also true of the 'conscientious objector' provision that for practical purposes it will overlap almost entirely with the 'existing employee' provision: the only people who might win an additional
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0932">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
benefit would be new employees and converts, either of which would be adequately protected by a provision confined only to an objection to being a member of any trade union whatsoever on grounds of religious belief.".</p></blockquote>
That is a dispassionate legal view of the difficulties that the Government are likely to be in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was raised of whether someone might suddenly have a deep personal conviction as a result of his subscriptions being increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be raised by less reasonable people under legislation that the hon. and learned Gentleman is introducing. That is the whole difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear in mind that a man might be a member of several chapels. A publication may be printed on one day or one night of the week. Sunday publications usually stand on their own. A man could be a member of three chapels and pay his contributions to his chapels and to the union. In addition to his chapel payment, he normally pays into a benevolent fund. He usually pays into a fund which pays benefits to retired members. In addition, there is usually something referred to as an uncle's club, contributions to which are used to take handicapped children on holiday, and so on. A chapel contribution usually comes to over £1, so if he is in three chapels, he pays about £3. Then there are his union contributions. He could well be paying a grand total of £3 or £4 a week. I can imagine someone thinking "If I could get out of this, it would be financially beneficial". But I have never known anyone seek to leave any of our chapels or closed shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to think of a possible scenario of a member coming into our chapel office and saying to the father of the chapel that he has suddenly developed a deep personal conviction against membership of the union. The FOC would probably send for the nurse to take his temperature, say "Pull the other one", or ask him to lie down thinking that he did not feel well. I have never known of such a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this question to the Under-Secretary. Let us suppose that a member did that, left and went to the tribunal, and that the tribunal upheld him and the union said to us "We must abide by the law". Because of the great benefits which he would be obtaining from the chapel and
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
the union, if he were to say that he did not intend to pay the £3 or £4 that the rest paid, I do not think, from my knowledge of the people with whom I work, that they would work with him. I am pretty certain that that would be the effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right in believing that if that happened, the onus would not be on the unions to pay compensation but on the employer? I think that that would be the net result. I do not know how many employers would welcome that extra burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of leaving well alone, it seems to me that we are opening a can of worms, a legal quagmire, that the Government could well regret in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly pleased that the Under-Secretaty has been able to accept the incorporation of the word "genuinely". Although he says that it is not important, I am convinced that it is. It helps to tighten a little what is really an extremely loose set of words in the clause. "Genuinely" will help somewhat when the tribunals are faced with the almost impossible task of interpreting this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary is being far too complacent about the problems that he is creating for tribunals if the clause remains unamended. He seemed to me to be rather unsure about it when he was speaking just now. We have the words:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction".</p></blockquote>
Up to the point where the hon. and learned Gentleman referred to that, he was almost saying that "deeply-held personal conviction" and "conscience" are the same thing. This clause tells us that they are not, otherwise we should not need to have them referred to separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the word "other" also appears, so it is accepted that conscience is one form of deeply-held personal conviction but that there are other forms of deeply-held personal conviction as well, and there is nothing in the clause which will help the tribunals in deciding whether any particular set of circumstances represents a deeply-held personal conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the greatest respect, it will not do for the hon. and learned Gentleman to tell us that it is not intended to cover trivial or transient objections. It is not for him to tell us what it will cover. It is for the tribunal to decide, and no one else. The tribunal will be faced with the almost imposisble
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
task of looking into people's minds to decide whether a particular objection is a deeply-held personal conviction or whether it is only a shallow personal conviction. How deep does it have to be in order to qualify for the description "deeply-held"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the kind of problems that the tribunal will have to face, and it is not good enough for the Minister to tell the Committee what he thinks it will cover or not cover. That will be of no consequence when the tribunal has to start work on an almost impossible task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>:—whether it is a genuinely held and deeply-held conviction. As my right hon. Friend said, perhaps a truth drug will have to be used—[
	<i>An hon. Member:</i> "A lie detector".]—a lie detector, because that is the only way that the tribunals will be able to implement the clause if it remains in its present form. They cannot apply an objective test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that it is not intended to cover trivial or transient objections, and he cited the example of someone who is temporarily disaffected by the union leadership. I think that he also said that it was not intended to include someone who objected to an increase in the subscriptions. But there can be very deeply-held personal convictions about an increase in the subscription. It may seem transient or trivial to the Under-Secretary, but it is not trivial to the individual. I know people who have very deeply-held personal convictions about standing a round of drinks in Annie's Bar when it is their turn. [
	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Name them".] The matter may appear to us to be trivial, but how can anyone—the Under-Secretary, the members of the tribunal or anyone else—look into a person's mind to decide whether it is a deeply-held personal conviction. This will be an impossible task for the tribunal. If these words were removed, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
we propose in our amendment, its task would be a great deal easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more serious note, an individual member of a union does not necessarily have the same logical mind as the Under-Secretary and may well have deeply-held personal convictions about the appointment of a new branch secretary or a new shop steward who is an Irishman, for example, or a woman, or a Jew, or a Methodist, or bald-headed. There are all sorts of things to which logical people such as the Under-Secretary would not object, or even reasonable people such as myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to make the serious point that objections are raised to things which appear to other people to be trivial but which are nevertheless deeply held. They may have no logical or reasonable basis, but they are still deeply-held convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old wording about religious belief is much easier to interpret. In the main, somebody who is objecting on grounds of religious belief is able to show evidence that he is a member of a religious sect or denomination which supports the view that he is putting to the tribunal that it is a genuine religious belief. But how this can be done in the case of personal convictions I really do not know. If the clause remains as it is now, the Under-Secretary and the Government are sending the tribunals on to a very foggy road indeed and they will get into all kinds of difficulties. It would be a matter of simple common sense to accept an amendment which would make the clause at least operable. As it stands, I do not think that it is operable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has been less than convincing in defining what are concientious objections or deeply-held personal convictions. He has admitted that he will consider the many practical problems that will arise if this clause is carried. We have not had from him any method by which conscience
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
is to be defined. He has not given us any examples of this. As my hon. Friends have already said, there is no difficulty so far as religious objections are concerned. Many of these problems are already solved on the factory floor. I have worked in closed shops where there have been individuals who belonged to religious sects who believe that it is ungodly to join a trade union, or indeed to belong to any association or society other than one which propagates their particular religious views. For example, they could not even become members of a football supporters' association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inside the factory these members are tolerated. There are many factories where the trade unionists shrug their shoulders because they recognise that however logically they argue with a particular employee, they will not be able to convince him that he is wrong. They accept this position, and although the employees concerned are not members of the union, they are allowed to remain at work. But in the odd cases where a union is intolerant, of course, this man has the right to appear before a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are concerned about are the other definitions of conscientious objections or deeply-held personal convictions. Let me try to give one or two examples, which the hon. and learned Gentleman refrained from doing when he introduced his own definitions. Suppose, for example, that a member of the Conservative Party, the chairman of his local constituency association, is a member of a trade union. Suppose that he is a member of a trade union which consistently at its annual conference passes anti-Tory resolutions. As a consequence, because of his deep convictions, he thinks that he should leave that particular union. The hon. and learned Gentleman will say that if he has already been a member of the union for some years, the tribunal might well say that it cannot really define it; he has been a member of the trade union and he cannot bring it up at that particular moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, of course, the legislation that we are now considering says that he can object to being a member of one particular union, and he could well say that he objects to being in that union because it passes anti-Conservative resolutions at its annual conference, it has elected a Communist to its national executive committee, and it is constantly expressing views with which he violently disagrees and which go against
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
his convictions, against his personal views and against his conscience, and therefore he wants to leave to join another union, a union which he would describe as nonpolitical. There are even some unions, probably not affiliated to the TUC, which have Conservative convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would a tribunal decide in this instance? There is no doubt, as Government members of the Committee will agree, that the convictions of this chairman of the constituency Tory association would have deeply-held political convictions. Political convictions can be held just as tightly—as in my case and in the case of many hon. Members—as religious convictions. So what would the tribunal decide in that situation? It wants only one tribunal to uphold a claimant's view and we should get circulars from the National Association for Freedom and, indeed, probably from the Conservative Central Office saying that this was an opportunity to opt out of unions with an anti-Conservative bias. It would lead to chaos as far as the trade union movement is concerned. Indeed, in the long term it might lead to two particular unions, as there are in France and Italy—the Christian unions and unions which have political objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, one has to define much more closely how the tribunal can decide what are deeply-held convictions, whether they be political or religious. It is up to the tribunal to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other cases. For example, a man may be the chairman of his local temperance society and object to the fact that the union is holding its meetings in a public house. He says that he certainly does not wish to belong to the union because his conscience tells him that drink is wrong, that intoxicating liquor should not be consumed in his presence, and so on, and as a consequence he wishes to leave the union. He does not want to leave the trade union movement, but he objects to being a member of that particular union which holds its branch meetings in a pub and he wants to join another union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman also bear in mind that there are many people who think that if this led trade unions to cease to be politically motivated and to concern themselves solely with negotiating terms and conditions of employment, this might be a beneficial result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly that objective is not carried out in history, because the trade unions have long recognised that they fight on two fronts—on the industrial front and on the political front. It is because of the immense influence of the trade unions on the political front that they have been able to make such advances—in this case, a step backwards. Nevertheless, even the present Bill convinces the trade union movement that it must take part in political action if it wants to protect its own members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor that we have not considered is the dislocation that would be caused to industrial relations if the clause were passed. The Engineering Employers Federation and other associations of employers recognise the danger that this clause entails as far as they are concerned. There may well be a number of people in a closed shop who object to being members of a particular union. They may object because the union is too militant. There may be objections from some members because the union is not militant enough. Perhaps they have political or other objections to joining that union. Under the clause, they can object to being a member of one particular union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it does not necessarily follow that they will all join another union. Some members might consider that they should transfer from the Transport and General Workers Union to the General and Municipal Workers Union. Others might consider that they should join a union that is not affiliated to the TUC. One or two of these are springing up, many of them management-inspired, but nevertheless they are springing up, and people may wish to join that particular union. Other individuals might even try to start their own unions. This is not unknown. As a consequence of this, we shall have a proliferation of unions in a particular shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members do not seem to realise that the advantage of a closed shop to the employer is that he can deal with one particular union. He can negotiate quite voluntarily, enter into an agreement for a closed shop and, as a consequence, he can negotiate with one body. When he reaches agreement in negotiations with the shop stewards the shop stewards act in the interests of the management. There is a widespread belief that shop stewards create
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
nothing but mischief. But when they enter into an agreement, they see that that agreement is carried out. In some instances they have to discipline their own rank and file, and say "We have signed this agreement on your behalf and you must toe the line". So they act as a sort of police force as far as agreements are concerned, seeing that the terms and conditions agreed in negotiations are carried out on the factory floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is a great advantage to employers to have a closed shop and to deal with one union. The Engineering Employers Federation realises this. If this legislation is carried, it seems that the employer will, perhaps, have to deal with many unions, many units, with dislocation and acrimony on the workshop floor, which will be bad for industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Conservative Party, the traditional party of the employers, who contribute so handsomely to its election funds, are not standing up on this clause on behalf of employers. They have something to lose, and they realise this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cumulative effect of all these provisions is a further attempt to erode the power of the trade union movement, and in trying to damage the trade union movement, the Government are damaging industrial relations generally. They are putting employers in a position where they are likely to face industrial unrest where industial unrest never existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I believe that we must consider carefully where we are going on this matter. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) asked his hon. and learned Friend what would be the position if political objections were brought forward. I did not think that the answer was satisfactory. The hon. and learned Gentleman is still convinced that this may well be a ground on which a tribunal will give a decision that people who hold political convictions hold them deeply and that they are conscientious opinions and, as a consequence, all sorts of problems and complications will be raised not only for trade unionists but for management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I hope that these amendments will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee. We have had a good run on this group of amendments. But I must say that, after what we have heard from my hon. Friends, if one can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
believe the hon. and learned Gentleman when he says that the words "deeply-held personal conviction" are needed for the removal of absurdity, one can believe anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) that the Minister confirmed that, in his view, membership of the Conservative Party might well constitute grounds for exemption from an obligation to belong to a particular union in a union membership agreement. It follows that if Conservative trade unionists—of whom we are told that there are many, though curiously enough it is never assumed that the trade union bully-boys of whom we are told are Conservative trade unionists—wanted to break away and set up a separate Conservative trade union in such a situation, this clause would be an open invitation for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I put to the Committee an equally likely possibility. Hon. Members will know that in some Western European countries—France, Belgium and Holland—there are trade unions with a religious basis. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce touched on this. If some Catholic members of trade unions that had adopted a policy on abortion wanted to use that as a ground for an exemption from the obligation to belong to such a union and to set up their own Catholic-based union, as has occurred in some Western European countries, that could happen under these provisions. No member of the Committee—certainly no one professionally engaged in industrial relations—could believe that that would be beneficial to industrial relations. It could only be harmful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are grateful for the small mercy accorded to us by the hon. and learned Gentleman in accepting amendment No. 78. We should be grateful also for his full explanation in response to the case put by the Opposition, in which he reflected the seriousness of the issues before the Committee. I say "grateful", but that is not to imply that we are happy with or satisfied with his reply. As my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington said, it fell far short of being convincing, although what he said about the Bridlington agreement and the disputes procedures of the TUC in connection with amendment No. 82 was interesting and useful. We shall want to consider what he said when it is on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Predictably, the hon. and learned Gentleman said that these are matters very much
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
for the tribunals to decide. That causes me the greatest concern. The tribunals were not set up to deal with such matters. The whole idea, as I have said repeatedly, is that the tribunals should be empowered to deal with industrial relations matters and be manned with people who are steeped in industrial relations experience. I do not know what qualifications my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) feels they ought to have, in view of his assessment of the new duties and the role that would be imposed on them. But they were not chosen because they had a particular perceptiveness and understanding of the depths of human nature—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Theologians?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Theologians. The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the courts have been doing just this for years. But the courts are presided over by people with very different training, experience and qualifications. Furthermore, that is one of the issues causing me anxiety, particularly in view of the record of the courts in industrial relations matters. I hope that the Committee will not overlook the possibility of some of these matters getting into the hands of Lord Denning. I shudder at the prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that we have a rule in the House that we seek not to criticise the judiciary, but the judiciary must not take advantage of the privilege and seek to abuse it. I think that I am entitled to draw to the attention of the Committee that Lord Denning has already made his anti-union attitudes abundantly clear. I have here a useful Fabian publication written by Roy Lewis, Paul Davies and Lord Wedderburn. On page 30 it says that Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls,
	<br><blockquote><p>"told a journalist on 20 April 1979 (and we quote from the original cable which has been authenticated to us): 'The unions have grown too powerful in Britain and they are almost above the law because of the statutes introduced by the Labour Government in 1974'."</p></blockquote>
So we see the prospect of more of these matters finding their way into the hands of the Court of Appeal and Lord Denning, imbued with those sentiments, that anti-trade union approach, making decisions on these questions. So we are far from happy both with the hon. and learned Gentleman's explanation and with the provisions of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one point the hon. and learned Gentleman sought to take some consola
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
tion from the fact that none of the amendments sought to take the law back to what it is at present. I must point out to him that, had we sought to do so, we could have been ruled out of order on the basis that such amendments would constitute a direct negative. I want to make clear now, lest it be thought that we in any degree accept anything that is in the clause, that I shall be advising my hon. Friends to vote against it as it stands when we come to the appropriate stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the moment, I say again that we are grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for the crumb that he has cast our way in the Government's acceptance of amendment No. 78, but I urge my hon. Friends to divide the Committee and to vote for amendment No. 82.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall be as brief and as lucid as possible as I can see that the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) is more filled with 'flu than enthusiasm today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me draw the background to the amendment. It seems to me that the establishment of a closed shop poses difficulties that all of us on both sides should worry about. It is inherently a closed-shop corporatist arrangement. It is done mainly for the convenience of the employer. As the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) said, it is often true that a closed shop arrangement is extremely helpful to an employer because it means that he has to deal with only one trade union and</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment proposed:</i>No. 82, in page 7, line 25, leave out from "whatsoever" to end.—[
	<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>

	<p>everybody in his employ is a member of the trade union. He does not have to have lots of separate negotiations with small groups of individuals.</p>

	<p>Equally, the closed shop is extremely helpful to the trade unions. It strengthens their membership and gives them a power and a strength in negotiation that they would not otherwise have.</p>

	<p>I suppose that one of the reasons that we have so many union membership agreements or closed shops in the United Kingdom is, as the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) said, that we have such a variety of trade unions, unlike Germany where there is only one union per industry. The question whether one belongs to a closed shop is not as important there, where there are not large numbers of trade unions all trying to represent specific classes of employee.</p>

	<p>The individual in a trade union membership agreement can be caught like a nut in a nutcracker, between the will of the union on one side and the convenience of the employer on the other. Therefore, as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
unions themselves admit, and the employees also, it is difficult to balance the rights of the individual against the collective rights of the members.</p>

	<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) that it is possible in certain circumstances to have fear and intimidation within union membership agreements. Having listened carefully to our debates, I must admit that, were I a worker under the convenorship of the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), I could well see that on occasion I might be afraid to cross him. On the other hand, if I were under the convenorship of the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), perhaps puzzlement would be a better word. With the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), perhaps it would be awe.</p>

	<p>We have to balance the positive rights of the many in wishing to belong against the negative rights of a few who for good reasons do not want to belong, and it may be that positive rights should in most circumstances have preference over negative rights.</p>

	<p>The practical reasons behind closed shop agreements must be borne in mind. Why are they introduced? They are introduced because it is generally felt within industry that they improve the atmosphere of overall industrial relations and the ability for collective bargaining to be conducted sensibly and without undue hitch. I think it worth making the point that the smooth running of our industry is the foundation of all our freedoms. If at the end of the day we have no industry and we have no wealth or wages, our freedoms are very much restricted.</p>

	<p>It is a problem of balance, and many of us on the Government Benches believe that, although in previous years it was arguable that the balance was always in favour of the employer, the balance has now shifted marginally too far the other way.</p>

	<p>It is always interesting to notice that trade unions, quite understandably, have always wanted to invoke the law on their side when they have found themselves not strong enough on their own account to get employers to introduce fairer systems of employment, whether in redundancy, health and safety at work or equal opportunity. In my opinion, they are right to take that line—it is a line equally prevalent elsewhere in the industrial world—but what is surprising is that, although they
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
will invoke the law to improve the conditions of service of their employees, they do not like having any introduction of the law to consider abuses which may exist on their side of the fence. That is why we feel that there is need to redress the balance in favour of a fairer system, a system which does away with those abuses which currently exist and which are dealt with in the Bill.</p>

	<p>As my hon. and learned Friend has said, there is nothing wrong in legislating to improve the psychology of bargaining. it is vital that there be a sensible and reasonable balance between both sides of industry and that that balance should be seen to be fair. I have tabled the amendment in the belief that it would help to achieve it.</p>

	<p>If, after the Bill becomes law, a closed shop is in existence, it is surely right that someone who wishes not to be in a trade union—for genuine reasons of conscience or deeply-held personal conviction—he should at the same time, if he benefits from the actions of that union in negotiations with the employer, pay something towards a charity or some other cause for that privilege.</p>

	<p>My hon. and learned Friend may pose the question: if, on grounds of conscience, a man does not wish to be a member of a union, why should he have to pay some form of Danegeld? The answer to that must be that he is one of very few. The vast majority of his colleagues have agreed to be members of a union, and he is virtually inevitably gaining from the action of the trade union in negotiating on his behalf.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend bear in mind also that the reason why the individual may not wish to belong to a trade union could be on some deeply held personal conviction that might have been connected with a positive disadvantage that was being negotiated with the trade union? Why, therefore, should he have- to pay Danegeld, as my hon. Friend calls it, for something that is a positive disadvantage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He may feel that it is a positive disadvantage. If that is the case, he must in all conscience negotiate separately with his employer. The whole point is that within a union membership agreement the employer will be negotiating with the union on his behalf. It will be impossible in practical terms and in other terms for the employer to negotiate

	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
individually with the employee. The point I am trying to make is that it is accepted even in those circumstances by those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Donovan took evidence from several people who did not wish to be members of a trade union for conscientious reasons—in fact, because of their Christian belief. According to paragraph 604,
	<br><blockquote><p>"They were ready to accept that such objections should be tested by a tribunal, and that nonmembers should be made to contribute to public funds or to acceptable charities on a scale at least equal to the appropriate union subscription."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 605 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our impression from the evidence we have heard is that trade unions in the main respect genuine conscientious objections, and are usually content if the objectors agree to pay to some charitable body the equivalent of the union dues. Where unions are not prepared to accept an offer of this kind, a majority of us think that some redress is called for in circumstances where the objector loses his job because of the introduction of the closed shop".—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain what happens when the individual concerned has an equally deeply-held personal conviction against paying contributions to a charity?

that later. I am coming to exactly that point. It has to be borne in mind in the context of the free-loader and whether this objection is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion, therefore, that can be made—I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will make it—is the argument as to whether this information can be put in a code of practice. If it were to be incorporated in a code of practice, that would not be the position. There might be a charity clause in the union membership agreement and—to come back to the point made by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther)—the man might well say that he had a conscientious reason for not paying to a charity. If he had, would he, at the end of his time, find that the right of the employer—which is the right on the question of conscience—overrode the code of practice? If it did, the employer would find that his union membership agreement did not stand up in front of a tribunal.
