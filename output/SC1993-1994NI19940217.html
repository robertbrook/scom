	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'> Rev. Ian Paisley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The order is substantial, with many schedules and pages. Is it possible for the Committee to adjourn and return to the issue later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not possible there is no sittings motion. I am sure that members of the Committee have had the documents for some time and have had the opportunity to read through them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Committee cannot return to the subject at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot return to exactly the same question, although it could deal with a similar issue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press me any further on the subject because I am not sure that I have the answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I want to help the Committee as well as those outside the House who may be interested. We are to consider a draft order; if the order is accepted by the Committee and the Government listen to hon. Member's concerns, is it possible that the order may be revised—in which case would it come back to the House or to the Committee? If it is not revised or does not meet with the Committee's approval, what happens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the subject before us. The premise on which the hon. Gentleman founded his remarks was wrong. We are considering the matter of the proposal for a draft order, so his point does not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Michael Ancram)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the proposal for a draft Children (Northern Ireland) Order.</p></blockquote>
The Government welcome today's debate on the proposal for a draft order—I underline the word "draft". I listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley). We all agree that the topic is important and one on which the Government welcome the chance to hear the views of members of the Committee. I want to emphasise that the purpose of today's discussion is to ascertain members' views. I do not intend to speak for long because I want to hear what the Committee thinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham, I can assure the Committee that my noble Friend Lady Denton will give close consideration to its views as part of her deliberations on the order. The order had not been
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
made, nor will it be for several months. The consultation period finished a few months ago, but we want to treat this morning's debate as part of that consultation process because I know that members of the Committee have significant issues to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to Lady Denton yesterday about the Committee, and she assured me that she would give careful consideration to all points raised by members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way! On such an important measure, it is important that there should be extensive consultation. Can the Minister explain why the measure is being introduced about five years later than the equivalent English legislation? What has caused the delay? Have there been policy problems in the Northern Ireland Office, or is there a lack of resources to draft the legislation? Delays are becoming common with Orders in Council. Can the Minister explain the cause of the delay, especially given that I and, perhaps, other hon. Members received a briefing this week from an organisation called Stonewall, which is interested in the age of consent for homosexuals? Stonewall claims that it has received an assurance from a Minister of State that if the House changes the age of consent, that change will be replicated in Northern Ireland as soon as possible. Why are Ministers saying that they will act speedily on that issue when we have had to wait so long for them to act on matters affecting the welfare of children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's question about the delay. I am sure that he appreciates that this is a large and complex order. He has only to look at the paperwork to see that. It represents the culmination of substantial work and is the most far reaching reform of this part of the law ever undertaken in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 185 articles and associated schedules. The preparation of the order involved not only the Department of Health, the Department of Social Security and the Office of Law Reform as joint promoters, but other Departments and agencies which will be involved in the implementation of the new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) that the usual criticism of Ministers is to the effect that not enough consideration is given to legislation before it is introduced and, if more consideration were given, the legislation might be better. That comment has been thrown at me several times during my ministerial career. We thought it important to have full and proper consultation. Indeed, the consultation period was extended. Today's debate gives hon. Members the chance to add their contributions, which I shall pass on to my noble Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what he has said. If it takes the Government a five-year period to introduce the order, surely we should have more time to consider this very important measure? If he is going to listen carefully to our comments—I have heard from my colleagues what matters concern them—and if there will, of necessity, be changes to the order, will he assure us that we shall have adequate time to debate it. Surely, if it took five years to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
prepare the order, a Committee should not deal with it in so a short space of time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more interventions I take now, the less time we shall have to hear the views of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend, who is responsible for the order, told me not only to consider the representations made to her as a result of the consultations that have taken place, but to hear also the views of hon. Members this morning. She also said the if hon. Members want to see her or to write to her, she will consider their views in that way. This is an important issue and she wishes to consider it carefully. That is why I am involved in a listening role. No decisions have been made about the final nature of the order and no amendments have been made to it as a result of the consultations. The deliberation period is to come. It would be helpful if hon. Members allowed me to continue with my brief remarks, even though it is appropriate to let members of the Committee give their views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eddie McGrady 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. He made much of the fact that consultation has been prolonged and that he is welcoming further consultation. The order is one of the most compact pieces of legislation that we have considered and it covers a difficult and delicate matter. How is it that organisations involved in Northern Ireland, such as Child Care, asked the Government as early as June 1992 for an independent, comprehensive and cohesive review of the matter, and that that request was rejected? Is the Minister saying that he wants a consultation review of the detail in the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that I had made it clear that we have had a consultation period, which has been extended. A hundred or more representations were made by interested organisations and those representations must be considered. In addition to that consultation period, our debate this morning, which I warmly welcome, gives members of the Committee a chance to add to that consultation process and to assist the deliberations of my noble Friend Lady Denton even further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 
	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend, but the more I give way, the less time we shall have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government have listened and considered. The difficulty that faces some of us is to find out what lessons have been learnt from the Children Act 1989 of England and Wales. The drafting of the order is shoddy—for example, it refers to eight days for a child protection order, but the 1989 Act refers to eight working days. Some of us have tried to find out what lessons have been learnt, but that information has not been communicated to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that during our debate hon. Members will have the opportunity to raise such questions. Those that I cannot answer today I will discuss with my noble Friend Lady Denton and supply answers.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
That is the importance of our debate and I feel that we may be wasting valuable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point raised by my hon. Friend and following the announcement that the 1989 Act will be reviewed, will the Minister say how any changes resulting from that review will be incorporated into the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman has raised that matter before—I believe he did so in a recent parliamentary question. We are unaware of any proposals for major changes to the 1989 Act. I understand that the suggestion was made in a newspaper article. I cannot comment further on that, but the Government's position is that we are unaware of proposals for major changes to that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps hon. Members will allow me to deal with the order, which is very important, even as a draft order. I know that I speak for all members of the Committee when I say that the welfare of children is of utmost importance and it is proper that the Committee is considering it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was to ensure the welfare of the children of Northern Ireland that my noble Friend Lord Arran, who then had responsibility for health and social services, announced the publication on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Services and the Office of Law Reform of a proposal for a draft children order in July last year. In response to that publication, more than 100 individuals and organisations with an interest in child care have forwarded comments, which are being considered. I am confident that the views of members of the Committee will form a valuable contribution to that consulation process.

The order will form the most important and wide-ranging reform of the law relating to children in Northern Ireland this century. It is a substantial document and I shall not take up time this morning by embarking on a detailed exposition of its contents. Those are set out in the explanatory document which accompanied the proposal when it was published and which hon. Members have before them today. I shall confine myself to saying a few words about the scope of the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will bring together most of the public and private law relating to children in Northern Ireland in a single, coherent, statutory framework along the lines of the Children Act 1989, which has been in operation in England and Wales since October 1991. It is based on the fundamental principle that the welfare of the child is paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drawing together of public and private law can be seen in the new concept of parental responsiblity which the order will introduce. That responsibility will continue when it becomes necessary for a child to be taken into care. We firmly believe that as far as possible children should be brought up and cared for within their own families and that family ties should be preserved even in case in which the state must intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order supports the concept that children are best looked after by their families. In the case of a child in need,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the order will secure that objective by the provision of services to the child and his or her family. It is not, regrettably, always possible, or indeed in the child's best interests to be brought up in the family environment. Where children are looked after away from home the Children Order will provide a legislative framework to ensure that their welfare is safeguarded and promoted. Whether they are looked after in accommodation provided by a health and social services board, a voluntary organisation, a registered children's home or are the subject of a fostering arrangement, the order will ensure that those involved in looking after children and the conditions in which they are accommodated meet a high standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is far reaching. It sets out the powers and duties of health and social services boards and the services to be provided, including those for disabled children. It will ensure the protection of children who are at risk. It addresses problems that may arise in relation to the child's education and makes provision to safeguard the welfare of children who are employed. Detailed provisions are included to ensure that those who provide child minding and day care services are subject to registration and inspection procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Children Order will affect most aspects of the provision of services for children and their families. It will also have a major impact not only on the health and personal services, but also on the courts, the police, the education services and the voluntary child care sector. As with the Children Act in England and Wales, all of this represents a substantial change in the law affecting the care and upbringing of children. Much preliminary work will, of course, be needed to ensure its successful implementation. However, I believe that the proposed Children Order represents a broad consensus on how child care law in Northern Ireland should develop and I am encouraged, as is my noble Friend Lady Denton, by the general welcome that has been given to the publication of the proposal. I am confident that the order will form an integral part of the community care reforms in Northern Ireland by providing the legal foundation for a comprehensive, community-based and needs-led child care service in which the interests of the child are paramount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister concludes, may I ask him to draw to the attention of his noble Friend Lady Denton the fact that the Minister impressed upon the Committee that this is only a draft order and, given some of the comments that have been made, it is possible that there could be a second draft order and that this order could be redrafted? Will the Minister assure the Committee that, if that is the case, the order will be discussed in Committee before it is laid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly pass on the hon. Gentleman's comments to my noble Friend. I shall also pass on the earlier comments of hon.

shall ensure that those comments are brought to her attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful for those words from my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the job of this Committee of the United Kingdom Parliament is to ensure that people in Northern Ireland know not only that their opinions and comments have been heard, but that they will be acted on as and when the Government are convinced that it is appropriate. I accept that there is a widespread welcome for the general changes and much of the detail relating to the welfare of children, but will my hon. Friend the Minister pass on to his noble Friend that we want to be sure that the Government have carefully considered points of interest and dispute among those who are involved on a daily basis with the welfare of children and that the Government have taken into account as many of those points as possible? That follow-on procedure matters. Will the Minister say—perhaps not today—what are the main outstanding points of detail and who should have particular responsibility for children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I undertake to ensure that my noble Friend hears what my hon. Friend said. I am sure he appreciates that it would be wrong for me to pre-empt her deliberations on something that is her responsibility. I can only undertake this morning to ensure that she is aware of the opinions that have been raised. Indeed, several specific points have been raised both publicly in letters sent to members of the Committee and in direct representations to the Government. She has assured me that she will consider those matters in the course of her deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to take up more of the Committee's time because it is important to hear the opinions of hon. Members. As far as possible, I shall try to respond at the end of the discussion to the points raised, as long as they do not attempt to pre-empt the deliberations of my noble Friend. I shall ensure that all points are drawn to her attention and, indeed, to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State before the draft order is laid before Parliament. I look forward to hearing what I hope will be a constructive discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.50 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering the order, I want to refer to three articles, because I am sure that other hon. Members want to contribute to our debate on the important and lengthy order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will bring Northern Ireland into line with the Children Act 1989, which now applies to other parts of the United Kingdom. Again, we must draw to the Minister's attention the significant difference between Northern Ireland and other areas of the United Kingdom. In my constituency and in other areas of England and Wales, there is local government involvement in the administration of such legislation. We are witnessing—we discussed this matter at length on Monday—the introduction of extra quangos in Northern Ireland. With the introduction of trust boards there will be limited or no local input into the administration of services. We shall, at least, seek an assurance from the Minister that provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
will be made for local people to have a voice and devise initiatives when considering the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following discussions with groups in Northern Ireland, some of the broad changes in the order should be welcome, but several questions need to be addressed and, perhaps, some amendments considered by the Minister and Lady Denton. We read that the child's welfare is paramount, that a panel of guardians will be created to safeguard the interests of the child and that the child can have his or her solicitor and direct access to court. Those are principles and proposals that many organisations involved in child care in Northern Ireland would welcome, with some interpretation. Other references in the order require qualification and explanation. What is the interpretation of "children in need"? We understand that children with a disability are included, but the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a reasonable standard of health or development"</p></blockquote>
which is often used in the order, requires more explanation. It is open to various interpretations. Paragraph (3) of article 50 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the question of whether harm suffered by a child is significant turns on the child's health or development, his health or development shall be compared with that which could reasonably be expected of a similar child."</p></blockquote>
If we then consider article 17(a) and use the same comparison of similar children, does the definition of children in need take account of poverty, culture, ethnic children or the lack of resources in a specific area? Will the comparison between children in similar circumstances refer to the problems that can develop in certain parts of the region?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 19(3)(b) allows a board to provide day care for under-fives, although they are not in need. There is no obligation on a board to provide day care for under-fives if the children are not in need. Trusts will have different policies depending on the area, the resources available and the demand for those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application and iterpretation of what represents children in need is a complex issue. The definition of "in need" varies so much that the order will be to the detriment of those shildren who are already socially, culturally or economically disadvantaged. I ask the Minister to address those important issues and to impress upon Lady Denton the need to qualify the interpretations, which people who are involved in caring for children in Northern Ireland want to promote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 17(a) should be amended to include cultural needs and the social and economic disadvantages of children; in other words, it should cover some of the concerns to which I referred. Many people have expressed that opinion, and I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should also be a duty on the Government, perhaps through the appointment of a children's rights commissioner in Northern Ireland, to monitor the differential impact of services geographically and in relation to gender social class, race or ethnic origin, disability, language or other status. If the Minister takes
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
seriously the request for a children's rights commissioner, that would be a constructive approach towards implementing the order in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is found that different provisions are made in different trust areas, corrective action should be taken to adjust those discrepancies. Resources should be made available to help children in need in the wider sense, rather than in the narrow interpretation outlined in the order. There should be statutory provisions for an annual report to Parliament, perhaps by the children's rights commissioner, similar to that submitted by the Lord Chancellor under the Children Act. That would provide an annual review of how the order operates in the Province. Such a report could be helped by an independent monitoring group made up of the voluntary organisations which play an active part in the care of children in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister advise the Committee about training and the trust boards'involvement? Who will be reponsible for training social workers and back-up staff and for ensuring training standards? Will that be the responsibility of independent boards or of a national directorate, or will provision be made by the Department? On accountability, will there be a further dotted line for social workers who report to the Minister? In another place, Lady Denton said that there would be a dotted line from a social worker to her. Will there be a dotted line under the provision, and how will that operate? Many people want clarification of those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What provision will be made to continue the voluntary initiative? Many voluntary organisations provide initiatives. How will that be encouraged under the order? How will the provision of preventive services apply? The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) asked whether evidence exists of the experience of the Children Act 1989 in England and Wales. Considerable research evidence shows that the family support part of the Act is not working as intended. Families receive help when it is too late—when they are in crisis—and not at an earlier stage. Red lights flash, but no action is taken because of a lack or resources and training. Many families receive help only when a crisis arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in view of the discussion last Monday, and with the introduction of 12 cash-limited trusts to administer the legislation in Northern Ireland, resources will not be adequate to service families when the early warning signs appear? Does he agree that only those in distressed circumstances can be helped because of the circumscribed resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I was trying to impress on the Minister. People who have applied the legislation in England and Wales have provided the crucial evidence that, owing to the lack of resources and trained people to administer the service, families who need assistance are denied it in the early days and it is provided only when a crisis arises. That is too late. If the legislation is to be successful in Northern Ireland, provision must be made for resources and a means of communication so that families that are having difficulties are helped before a crisis arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Table 3.1 of the 1992 report on the Children Act shows clearly that in the first year of the Act's operation, local authorities targeted services at families for which they already had responsibility, whereas other needy groups—for example, school truants and families whose gas, electricity or water had been disconnected—were very low on the list of priorities. The report shows that further investigation is needed to show how the legislation is working in England and Wales. The services that are suffering from lack of resources must be identified so that the same problems do not arise in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales the evidence has been provided by local authorities and in Northern Ireland it will be provided by trust boards, which the Minister will set up. One can readily see that the evidence in Northern Ireland will not be forthcoming in the same way as in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we should have an independent monitoring body in Northern Ireland, made up of local people, which would have an input in reporting to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening in England and Wales is disturbing when we consider what will happen in Northern Ireland, where proverty is widespread. For example, 95,000 children live in one-parent households, 70 per cent. of which are dependent on state benefits for their income; and 39 per cent. of children live in households with a total income of £121 a week or less. In October 1993, debts owed to the Housing Executive were more than £18 million. There are 13,885 claimants who have their benefit deducted and who find it very difficult to meet the extra costs that are sometimes necessary to provide for the family. More than 11,500 people have other benefits deducted. The order will do nothing to help the real problems affecting children. That is why some of us have asked that there should be an opportunity for members of the Committee to consider the order after Lady Denton has examined the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of small private children's homes, which operate in England and Wales and perhaps also in Northern Ireland, should be investigated. A private home which has four children or fewer does not come under the inspectorate that covers larger homes. Registration of smaller homes should be considered. If there are three or four children in a private home which is not registered or not inspected, those children could be at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no record of small private children's homes in Northern Ireland. Some of my colleagues have raised that matter in the House and emphasised the need for registration and inspection. I hope that the Minister will make inquiries and ensure that the problems emerging in England and Wales will not be allowed to develop in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put to the Minister one or two significant points which people inside and outside the House will want him to address. I accept that he might not today have the answers to some questions, but I would appreciate it if he gave the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Committee the opportunity to receive awnswers in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.8 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Ulster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate. My colleagues on both sides of the Committee, especially those from Northern Ireland, are aware of the keen interest in this morning's debate expressed by many professional and voluntary organisations. The order is regarded as the most significant reform to legislation relating to children. It is important that Government get it right, so we should take the time to debate the subject. Many comments and recommendations have been made to me by Northern Ireland Members, and I have no doubt that if the Minister listens carefully and wants to act on them, there will be a second draft of the order. I have no doubt also that that second draft would return to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want another assurance. It is important that the final order is discussed on the Floor of the House. The order is of such major importance—185 articles and 10 associated schedules—that the debate should be at least three hours long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received numerous representations from a wide range of professional and voluntary bodies, all of which want the order to be far-reaching in scope and meaningful in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is overshadowed by the considerable change for many of the organisations involved. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) mentioned the major change taking place in the trusts. Those changes have had major implications for health and social services boards with the development of the distinction between provider and purchaser and the arrival of trust status for many management units. I am genuinely concerned that, instead of having closer local control of the affairs of Northern Ireland people, the proposals represent a further step back. Non-elected representatives, nominated by the Minister for the trusts, will carry out much of the policy as dictated by the Government, sometimes without considering the best interests of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have fallen under the wrath of the boards in relation to another health and social services issue which I am not allowed to deal with this morning—a maternity matter in my constituency. The Government-nominated representatives certainly did not listen to the will and the concerns of the people in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Children (Northern Ireland) Order is genuinely and generally welcome in the Province, although there are specific concerns, which the Minister must address. I accept that the Minister will be unable to address the issues in depth this morning. I would prefer Lady Denton to listen carefully when the Minister tells her about our comments and to give us genuine, considered answers, instead of the Minister giving us off-the-cuff answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of the order depends on strategic planning and needs assessment at board and local level. Many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
people's concerns are heightened by the fragmentation of the process over several small trusts. How will the Department guarantee that the wide range of services proposed in the order will not have wide policy and procedural variations which will make inter-agency agreements difficult to reach and implement? Those issues have not been fully thought through, and problems will surface endlessly as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Department ensure that the service will be delivered equitably across the Province, bearing in mind the number of trusts, each with its own financial priorities and restrictions? I strongly recommend that the progress of the legislation is carefully monitored. The Department should take the lead in collecting the necessary data to enable that to be done effectively, but effective monitoring can be done only by an independent group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholeheartedly endorse the statement that the child's welfare should be paramount, taking into consideration the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child, his physical, emotional and educational needs and the likely effect on the child of any change in his circumstances. I welcome the provision for parental responsibility, because it recognises the continuing nature of that responsibility. I strongly believe that parents should carry a firm responsibility for their children. However, the article on parental responsibility needs further clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several interested professions have asked for further consultation on that issue. In reference to that responsibility, the order seems to assume that the parents are always genuinely and keenly interested in the child's well-being. I should like to think the best of parents, but I have been in pastoral Me and public life long enough to know that much is left to be desired in that aspect of family life today because of the many pressures that are placed on people's lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the court should be empowered to remove parental responsibility. Of course, such actions must be handled with extreme care and sensitivity, proving beyond doubt that the action is in the strictest interest of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next issue in need of clarification is the term, "children in need." In the order, the term seems to be used generally, and it would be open to interpretation. There is a need for a Province-wide interpretation of "children in need" to ensure that targeting and service provision are equitable throughout the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern that, because there are several trusts, the words will not be interpreted in the say way, with the result that the same service will not be given to children in every part of the Province. The fine talk and well-meaning phrases in the legislation for family support are worth the highest commendation, but those words and fine phrases will be absolutely worthless unless adequate funding is provided to make the provisions a reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that having to deal with the legislation will considerably expand the role of the boards, which may not have the experience and resources necessary to deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
with it and, in particular, may not have the resources to find accommodation for children who must be removed from the home because of violence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt whatsoever that the hon. Lady is correct. The boards do not have the experience or the resources to enable them to obtain that expertise when such a situation arises. That causes grave concern in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only with a firm injection of resources can the service be undertaken on a need-led basis. Family support is an essential part of good child-based legislation where it is important to reduce the need for children to be taken into care. However, I am assured that in England and Wales, provisions similar to those set out in part IV are not working as intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Government learn from what is happening in England and Wales and correct the measures in the order. The right time to target families on family support is when need is identified, not when they reach the crisis stage. We must firmly identify the importance of prevention as well as that of rescuing children. Schedule 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every Board shall take reasonable steps to identify the extent to which there are children in need within the Board's area."</p></blockquote>
What is the definition of "reasonable steps"? That could be interpreted differently by each board. It is a woolly term which needs to be tightened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that separate guidance should be given on shared care and respite care as distinct from the general requirements on children's long-term accommodation. Can the order clearly define respite care to differentiate it from other forms of care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to compulsory state intervention, I discovered during my consultations that the term "significant harm" was contentious and also needs clarification. Such a wideranging term will lead to inconsistent interpretation. The term "similar child" will also be open to wide interpretation. Clarification will guide not only the statutory and voluntary agencies but the judiciary. What advice will be given to clarify the nature of evidence that must be gathered to substantiate "significant harm"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Belfast, South said, the eight days specified in the emergency protection order are insufficient. Eight working days would be more apporopriate because of public holidays and because it is not always easy to gain access to magistrates. The hon. Gentleman also said that the period is eight working days in England and Wales. Why was the change made? It is not in the interests of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several concerns about day care. Why does the Department think that it is satisfactory to deregulate the services for children over eight years? What are the resource implications for boards of the widening requirement to register those looking after children for more than two hours in 10 days? Why was it not thought
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
opportune to clarify in the order the age below which it is illegal to look after children? What is the age limit at which a child may be left unattended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I respect the good will behind the provisions on child employment, how will they be implemented and policed? Implementation would require an army of officers. With the restrictions on resources, many believe that it will be impracticable for the education and library boards to police the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further anxiety for the professionals involved in the operation of the legislation is the legal implication of the administration of the Act. It is difficult to make constructive comments on that major issue without a clear indication of the legal structures under which it is to be operated. Will the Minister clarify the right to appeal and explain how the appeal system will operate? What guidance will be given on the allocation of cases in the court hierarchy and to the selection and training of court personnel?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad principle of the legislation is welcomed in the Province, but everyone to whom I have spoken has stressed the substantive resources that will be needed. Many fear that lack of resources will be the greatest impediment to proposed ideology. Many of my colleagues in the Province, especially health spokesmen of the parties there, have a particular interest in the matter. I do not want to detain the Committee further, but throughout our debate we shall identify many matters that are causing grave concern. Other matters will be raised, some of which I know about and support. They are so numerous that, if the Minister is going to deal with them with the seriousness that she intends, she must return with a second draft and give us the opportunity to consider the further recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.26 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) and welcome the Government's decision to have this debate in the Northern Ireland Committee. It enables us to reveal the depth of concern throughout the Province and to tease out some of the issues in the draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the draft order. It is 14 years since the Black report and nearly five years since the corresponding legislation was introduced in England and Wales. Better late than never, but, with the years of gestation and subsequent experience, there could have been improvements. I understand the problems facing Lady Denton, who has only recently been appointed. With others, I have already formed a favourable opinion of her approach to matters in Northern Ireland, and I look forward to her keeping the Department under control. The Minister said that he will be informing her of our proceedings, but, as in sermons, the thunder and lightning will be missing. Atmosphere and body language are necessary to convey anxieties in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order contains much that is good, and its introduction should improve child care systems and
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
protection for children at risk. Like other hon. Members, I draw attention to some of our anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday, we debated community trusts, and the tone of that debate reflected the widespread anxiety felt by the majority of those who work in the social services in Northern Ireland and those of us who take a close interest. I do not understand why it was necessary to introduce those two major pieces of legislation simultaneously, especially when there was so little opportunity for those who will have to make the system work to comment on the proposals. The advice of those who had such an opportunity has, amazingly, been studiously ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we pressed earlier for more time, we discovered that, due to a perplexing bureaucracy, the order had been published in the summer, just in time for our holiday. It created other problems, too. We therefore welcome the extension to enable us to examine the proposals. However, we place on record our view that, when the Northern Ireland Office brings out draft orders, it should work to the timetable of the community, not its own schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why, with such a radical departure from the traditional system, a pilot trust was not established to clear up the teething troubles which, inevitably, will flow from the changes. While we have some insight into the success or failure of the operation of the order in England and Wales since 1990, no one can predict how such an order will operate under the administration of community trusts. Why should Northern Ireland, with all its other problems, be a guinea pig for Government health and social services reforms that could later be extended through a trust system to great Britain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are suggestions that the four boards should be reorganised. That is a complete change in the administrative procedures in Norther Ireland and people are expected to cope with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall examine the specific details of the order. I am anxious that its effect on the voluntary sector is not understood. Under the old system, boards were constrained by resources and statutory responsibilities to make child protection services a priority within the public sector. However, they tended to pursue preventive strategies in partnership with the voluntary sector, using slippage money to support voluntary developments in preventive services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That resulted in child protection services being provided mainly by the public sector and prevention services by the voluntary sector. If current measures were introduced to facilitate the delivery of children's services, why were the proposed structural changes not developed in response to the preventive principles of the order? The plans seem merely to perpetuate the child protection bias of the current board structure. As 72 per cent. of preventive work with children is provided by the voluntary sector in partnership with the boards, voluntary child care agencies would appear to be guaranteed a central role in the implementation of the order. However, there is no mention of that in the March 1993 paper on the delegation of statutory functions. The contractual relationship
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
between boards and trusts would ensure that priority was given to the delivery of child protection services. Prevention may therefore be regarded only as an optional service that will be delivered on the basis either of availability of resources or of the consumers' ability to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we relying on trusts rationalising enough of their services to create slippage money to pay for voluntary sector care or are we relying on the voluntary sector, when there is cut throat competition for diminishing contributions, to conjure up by magic the additional funding required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem is the inter-agency action and multi-disciplinary working, to which reference was made, and which I underline. Much time and effort has been required to achieve sound working relationships, for example, between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the four boards and the units of management. There is anxiety that those will be threatened at each of the 12 or 13 trusts postulated, and that separate agreements will be required because of independent service procedures. It would be hard for either party to justify the expenditure of considerable resources on separate arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order relies heavily on the development of strategic planning and needs assessment at board and local level. The fragmentation of that process among several small trusts raises difficulties. A variation in policy and procedure may make inter-agency agreements difficult to reach and implement. It may add also to the administration expenses of the service rather than providing money at the workface where it is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that fragmentation in the planning and delivery of services and the different financial priorities of trusts will militate against the equitable delivery of services in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the funding of manpower and training. The most critical aspect of the measure is the perennial problem of training. For example, are the agencies involved in child care—the judiciary, education, housing and so on—aware that their staff will require training if they are to understand the order's implications? More importantly for those departments, which will pay for its implementation, the Government have said that additional manpower cover will be available for guardians ad litem. We have a limited knowledge of guardians ad litem in Northern Ireland on adoption issues. That is something that goes much wider and it is causing anxiety. Is the Minister aware that the education and library boards have said that no manpower is available to implement the requirements of part VII—the employment of children? That falls within the Minister's remit and he will have to seek guidance from his noble Friend Baroness Denton.

The Children Act Advisory Committee report for 1992–93—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not waiting for guidance for my noble Friend. As it is her responsibility, it is proper that I do not pre-empt her views and her decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. There we have the seamless robe of Government. Several Ministers have
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
been labouring in the Department through the gestation period and we thought that they had a fair idea of what was going on. Perhaps the Department has not yet told them everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Children Act Advisory Committee monitored the Children Acts in Great Britain. The committee identified the training of the agencies involved as a matter which, after several years, continued to need attention. We should have a head start and learn from them, but there is no evidence that we have learnt anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for jurisdiction and procedure, the advisory committee identified what it referred to as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a number of tensions in the current judicial system",</p></blockquote>
which related to the fact that there was no interface with criminal law. It also identified divergent procedures in family and criminal proceedings. Similar problems will arise here unless the Minister incorporates the relevant lessons in the new measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard on Monday one of the most horrendous responses to the order from those in the legal profession who said that it was "a bonanza for lawyers". We should be concerned that the impact of shoddy drafting—the matter of a similar child and significant harm, which was referred to earlier—will be argued in the courts, not necessarily to the benefit of the child or the family involved but to the lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to a contentious issue. When the draft order was presented, some hon. Members accused social workers of using wardship orders too speedily. I understand, however, that they rarely did so if they could avoid it. The bulk of those orders were taken out by citizens representing one or other of the parents who wanted to use them as a defence mechanism for their interests, rather than those of the child. However, the social services had to implement the order. The introduction of a full range of orders, including protection and supervision orders, is causing great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Children Act Advisory Committee identified a trend towards an increasing complexity and duration of court cases involving children. That created a log-jam and reduced the number of staff available to take on new cases. Clearly, those deciding on the number of guardians ad litem to be trained may need to take that factor into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to other legal matters, I support those who have already pressed, at the behest of professionals, for an exclusion order. As I have been a pastor for 20-odd years, I know something of the heartbreak of broken homes, when the mother or the social worker had to remove the children for their protection, instead of using an exclusion order that would move from the home for the period of investigation the person who was accused of abuse or other problems. Why must we always allow the innocent to suffer, while the guilty seem to benefit from the concern of others? In a similar vein, courts should be empowered to remove parental responsibility from the parent who is consistently acting against the interests of the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
It has rightly been said that the family is where the child should be nurtured, but if it were obvious that that was not happening, I question, in the interests of the child, whether that should be maintained. Clearly, the order incorporates great changes for child care in Northern Ireland. The Minister has received a great deal of written evidence and advice on what is required. Given the fait accompli of community trusts, more consideration should be given to the views of those who care for children in the Province. It is they who will have to make the system work. By doing so, it is they who will salvage the Goverment's reputation, for it is clear that the reforms are too much upheaval to be absorbed at the one time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that others wish to add other issues to the order, but I plead for consideration to be given to the reform of our court system. A proper family court should be developed within Northern Ireland. Furthermore, we must give more consideration to the care of children and to the vetting of those in the voluntary sector who are employed to look after children when they should not have been so employed. In my judgment, it is not the best thing to employ a kleptomaniac as a bank teller or a shop assistant. It is important to monitor who is employed to look after children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Joe Hendron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members, I welcome the order. It is one of the most important measures in respect of Northern Ireland for some time. As the hon. Member for Belfast, South said, it seems odd that we debated the setting up of shadow trusts on Monday evening, given that, when the shadow trusts become trusts on 1 April, it will be mainly those trusts that implement the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I studied carefully the speech of the noble Baroness Denton on 31 January. It concerned the setting up of the trusts, but it is relevant to our debate. I quoted from her speech on Monday night and will not repeat it again, except to say that she acknowledged the great frustration that exists, especially among those delivering services to do with children - social workers, health visitors, the police, the courts and others. However, she went on to say that she was satisfied that the shadow trusts had already set in train procedures to deal with the final recommendations in respect of the children order. I do not accept that. That is not a criticism of the chief executives and their staff who are working aso hard in the shadow trusts. I have been involved in primary health care for 30 years in an area that comprises mostly people in social classes 4 and 5, and I do not think that such procedures are yet in motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important aspects of the order is that it will involve children across Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster has already referred to the great pressures on family life in places such as west Belfast, where I have been working. The pressures on families from paramilitary organisations, poverty, deprivation and so on are immense. Many noble organisations and people concerned with child care have approached us. I accept that the Government want to bring in substantive legislation that is meaningful, practical and useful, but I
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
find the question of how the provisions will fit together mind boggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Monday, I attended a meeting with the hon. Members for Mid-Ulster and for Belfast, South, Mr. Stuart Dixon of the Alliance party—they are the spokesmen for their parties—and some senior professionals concerning the order. Those senior professionals have spoken to us on previous occasions and have given us many well thought out documents on the matter. On Monday we asked them to provide specific recommendations about the order and they have done so. The Committee will be happy to hear that I am not going to read the document out. The hon. Member for Belfast, South was given a copy; I was to get one last night, as was the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster. I have now received one and I, or those who wrote it, will ensure that the Minister and the Baroness receive a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document makes specific recommendations relating to various articles, and I shall give two examples. Concerning family support, it recommends that precise definition of proper funding and care is essential if part 4 of the order is to succeed. Article 17, which concerns the interpretation of which children are in need, must be strengthened and clarified to ensure that all the proper services are available to the wide range of children that the order is intended to support. Concerning child protection, the document recommends that articles 62, 63 and 64 could be improved by extending the relevant period from eight to 15 days. I strongly recommend study of the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the spokesmen for the three parties that are represented here will be happy to forward the document to the Minister. It is vital to show that it is supported by the professional and voluntary organisations and has the full support of the elected representatives of the people of the Province.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point and, if it is all right with the hon. Member for Belfast, South, I shall go along with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of children with disabilities is important and is generally welcomed. As has been said, the definition of disability in the draft order is offensive and stigmatising. It introduces means-tested payments for several services. We believe that such services should be provided on the basis of need. Access to services will be denied to some parents and children if payments are imposed. We commend that boards should have a duty to take into account the child's religious persuasion, racial origin, culture and linguistic background when taking decisions about that child. In Northern Ireland, racial minorities do not have the protection of the Race Relations Act 1976 and the performance of boards, units, trusts, and so on should be closely monitored on their attention to the issues of race and culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton referred to a children's rights commissioner. There must be an independent commissioner, or whatever, because it is completely mindboggling how everything will fit together. I am not trying to dampen the issue because I want the system to work. It must be understood that the police in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Northern Ireland will be very much involved in the implementation of the legislation, as will health visitors, social workers, general practitioners and, at the centre of it all, the family unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Members for Mid-Ulster and for Belfast, South for agreeing to give the document, to which I referred, to the Minister. The points that I raised are adequately covered in that document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just made the point that it is obvious to all that in the order for England and Wales it is a condition that a report be made to Parliament, but there is no such condition in this draft order. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is imperative that a regular survey is carried out of the quality of the provision and the extent of the services, and that such a report should be made to Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely. I turn to the issues of co-ordination, accountability and careful monitoring. We recently had the Houston report in Northern Ireland, following a dreadful case of sexual abuse in West Belfast. I am not pointing the finger at any particular person or organisation. I have great sympathy for social workers in those circumstances. Those who are not involved in primary health care tend to attack social workers, saying, "Why did you do that?", or, "Why did you not do that?". When we read that extensive report, we can understand the difficulties involved in co-ordinating services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drugs problem among children in Northern Ireland is worrying. One report recently stated that about 35 per cent. of children in the 14-to-16 age group have been tempted by drugs at some time. It is a big problem in Dublin and London too. We do not want to have the same problems in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.54 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will want to support what the hon. Gentleman said about ensuring that the drugs problem does not grow in Northern Ireland to the same extent as it has grown in other parts of the British Isles. It is an important day in two senses. Political parties in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are coming together to support the major aims in the Government's document and trying to ensure that children are looked after in their families—where it is best done—with both parents playing a full part and without resort to legal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One welcome advance in the United Kingdom is the fact that the number of children who have been taken into care has fallen by nearly two thirds over the past 10 or 15 years. The problems arise with children who need intervention from social services—often at the request of their families, and often not—and with children who become subject to court proceedings. The unification and reform of public and private law would be welcomed, so that children's views can be taken into account more often in decisions made about their lives, when they are of an age to be able to express them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the Children Act 1989—in so far as it affected other parts of the United Kingdom—was
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
built on consulation with practitioners and took into account the experience of judges, magistrates or solicitors and barristers specialising in such work. It was worth having those years of preparation. I hope that the order—as amended—will have the same thing said about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will forgive me if I do not go into details—they have been put forward well by Northern Ireland Members, who have spoken on the basis of their experience and who have reflected some of the views put forward by those with a great deal of experience and expertise. There remain some issues surrounding the trust into which I shall not go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be able to say, from the standpoint of another part of the United Kingdom, that the political process is working at its best when one is unable to tell people's party from the points that they have made also requires me to say that the work that Members of Parliament put in—listening to professional and family groups and doing the necessary research—is a hidden part of politics. It does not get covered in the headlines. I hope that the media in Northern Ireland who are following today's debate will reflect on how important it is to have close community contact across a range of experience. In that way, one can provide an uplift for children, one can reduce avoidable disavantages and distress, and one can promote well-being.

	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee long. All Northern Ireland Members endorse the broad aim of the order. The care, custody and welfare of children—born and unborn—in Northern Ireland are precious to us. However, many of us have problems with certain parts of the legislation. Earlier I told the Minister that it would have been appropriate to have given professional bodies—when they asked in June 1992—the chance to give the benefit of their professional experience to the Department. The hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) said that it is often forgotten that many of the problems land on our desks in our constituency surgeries. They are fraught with all sorts of difficulties for lay persons like ourselves. The problems for the families—particularly the children—and for the larger families that are too common in Northern Ireland are heart-rending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I am greatly concerned about what I understand to be the cash limiting of the 12 shadow trusts or quangos that will cover a population of 1.5 million in Northern Ireland. They will operate within the social services areas, and be responsible for executing the legislation. If they are cash limited their resources will necessarily be directed towards their priorities, which must be the children in greatest need of immediate protection and counselling—those in danger. The broader, and equally—if less immediately—important category of children who would not be at risk if proper family counselling were given in time, will not be offered that facility, because of the cash limitations which permeate training, manpower, expertise and the lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is particularly important that the interdependence of the 12 shadow trusts, as they are now, should be co-ordinated; otherwise the legislation will have 12 disparate applications. That is why, as my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West (Dr. Hendrun) mentioned, it is important that a report be collated by somebody. Under the English legislation I understand that the Secretary of State for Health is required to report to Parliament. In this case there is no such provision. It is most important to receive an updating of the progress of the order, based on practical experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch briefly on the question of child advocacy. A gap seems to exist in child advocacy services in Northern Ireland and it is difficult to know how the child's voice should be heard in the existing legislative context. Many of the professional organisations would like to know how the idea can be implemented in Northern Ireland. They suggest that there is a need for a local watchdog on laws and policies affecting children, such as a children's legal centre. The hon. Member for Belfast, South emphasised matters relating to the guardian ad litem. Some of the children's organisations support the service, but they stress that it is important that it should be independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The registration of day care and child minding facilities has already been mentioned. The voluntary sector, which makes a substantial contribution and, with the imposition of cash limits, will be required to contribute even more, is concerned about the imposition of registration fees. That might make it impractical for it to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us reasonably ample assurances, which I hope will be translated into reality, that he will take on board the concerns of many Members of the Committee and, perhaps more importantly—I do not mean to insult the hon. Members—the concerns of the professionals working in Northern Ireland, who know the different problems of different areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different areas of multiple social deprivation require different emphases and approaches, which should none the less be part of an harmonious and complete administration. I hope that the Minister will table amendments on the areas of dispute, which cannot be detailed this morning. I hope that there will be a new draft order and that ample time will be given to enable hon. Members and others to become involved in this important
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
legislation which, as I said in my opening remarks, deals with the welfare of children and is close to the hearts of all families and people in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Article 5(6) provides for each person with parental responsibility to act alone and without the other in meeting that responsibility. Several families in my constituency have difficult marital problems and relationships can be strained. In those circumstances, the provisions could present problems for families and should be considered in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that teachers and schools will face great problems?

I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South on the term "significant harm" in paragraph 50. That is ambiguous and must be more clearly defined. It will be necessary for the legislation, reulations and guidance to promote a multidisciplinary consultation process on that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "domestic premises" in article 118(2) is unclear. That ambiguity is a particular problem, given that lone parents must rely on others to look after their children from time to time. Must people who care for children for more than two hours be registered? Clarification on that would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.8 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Lestor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: the Minister and all hon. Members will agree that many of the criticisms, which are fundamental to the order, have been made in unison from all parts of the Committee. I support the idea that we have another look at the matter in a second draft that includes some of the points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he wanted to make clear that contrary to a newspaper report, there is no intention to amend the Children Act 1989. Section 83 of that Act made provision for reporting each year to Parliament and for the Children Act Advisory Committee annual report to deal with the operation of the Act. That implies that from time to time the emphasis of the provisions and the provisions will be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the order, Northern Ireland will have an untried administrative structure. I am particularly concerned about how the monitoring will take place. Nothing in the order specifies that there will be a similar structure to that which operates in England and Wales for the Children Act. I hope that that can be clarified and that we can return to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The right of advocacy has been mentioned. Children should be listened to and someone should be available to speak on their behalf. In England and Wales, the Department of Health has made funds available for advice and advocacy reports. If they are not available in Northern Ireland, it will be difficult to carry out what is implicit in the order—that advocacy on behalf of children will take place. We want clarification on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of vetting has not been raised today even though it has been mentioned by some of the organisations that have briefed us so brilliantly and, in particular, by Gingerbread. Under the Children Act 1989 many people employed to work with children are vetted before they take up their post. The police keep records of people who have abused children in one way or another. However, the process is taking a long time and people are still waiting to be vetted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vetting has never applied to voluntary organisations. Although some time ago I received a parliamentary answer stating that there was a pilot scheme for voluntary organisations, vetting has never been applied to them. The order refers to the importance of vetting—I agree with that. However, in Northern Ireland, as well as in England and Wales, it is important to know how the concept applies to voluntary organisations, which everywhere play an important part in dealing with children and in providing services, but especially in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister make it clear how vetting will apply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On exclusion orders, the Minister said that there were no plans to amend the Children Act. In England and Wales—and in the Scottish law review report on "Scotland's Children"—calls have been made for changes to be made and stronger measures to be taken to enable a suspected perpetrator of abuse of a child to be removed from the home, rather than the child being removed. I was on the Committee that discussed the Children Act and it was thought that that would be difficult, but other countries have legislated for it and Scotland is considering such a proposal. People involved would like some idea from the Government of their thinking. The Children Act Advisory Committee annual report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The committee has noted the debate on these issues and will consider if it should make urgent representations to Ministers to provide such a power".</p></blockquote>
If the order is to deal with such matters, it would be a pity not to consider such a provision now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also consider the issue of housing, the accommodation needs of young people and after-care services. Last year, nearly 700 young people between the ages of 16 and 18 presented themselves to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive as homeless. Under the order, boards will have a responsibility to provide accommodation for young homeless children if they consider that their welfare is likely to be seriously prejudiced without the provision of accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in England and Wales, the Children Act housing action group conducted a survey among 86 social service
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
departments. It found that only 4 per cent. said that they had adequate resources to comply with the Act. If we are serious about doing something for the young people who are sleeping in the streets and facing enormous difficulties, as my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton said, resources should be provided to implement the order. The evidence shows that the unfortunate aspect of the Children Act in England and Wales is that it has not been backed by resources. The number of children in need is determined by the resources available, not by need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the order is to work, we must all work on the assumption that we should prevent children from getting into difficulties. I hope that the Minister will make a second coming so that, once our points are taken on board, we can discuss them again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time that anyone has suggested that I should come a second time. As I am a re-retread in Parliament, I have done well enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been useful. My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham was right that it shows that the Northern Ireland community can come together, regardless of political differences, to discuss a subject such as the order and make constructive suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall pass on hon. Members' comments to my noble Friend Lady Denton. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if, in answering points, I do not attribute the question to the hon. Member who raised it. Some points were made several times. I hope that I shall cover all the important points. I shall arrange for hon. Members whose questions are not answered to receive written replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton made many significant points .He and the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster mentioned the definition of children in need. The Government have tried to retain a definition that does not restrict the duty of health and social services boards to provide a range of services to children in need and their families. It would not be acceptable to withhold services from children or families who are in severe difficulties simply because an individual case does not fulfil rigidly defined criteria. Over-defining can be dangerous and result in drawing parameters too tightly and excluding people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to restrict the necessary investigations of a board to identify children in need, by setting out rigid pre-defined criteria, which would also limit the board's ability to target resources to those who need most help. I appreciate hon. Members' anxieties, but there are dangers in being too specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that professional voluntary organisations and elected representatives in the Province are not satisfied with the width of interpretation that the order could be given?

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard what the hon. Gentleman said and I shall report his remarks. However, it is right that I should present the other side. The same problem will arise with some of the other definitions that we have discussed.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The hon. Member for Normanton also asked whether there was a danger that individual trusts would set different standards for providing services for children and for assessing need. Before a board can delegate to a trust, the board and the trust must agree a scheme, which requires the approval of the management executive. It is unlikely that boards will not wish to maintain service standards across Northern Ireland. Trusts will also be expected to comply with appropriate departmental guidance. Boards and trusts will have to agree schemes to set out standards. We believe that that combination would ensure a general standard across Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. However, the trusts are purchasers and providers of services. Therefore, the underlying importance of providing service will depend on the available resources. The hon. Member for Belfast, West said that the socio-economic group in his constituency is in the lower categories. That group needs greater resources. The Minister claims that there will be an across-the-board practice. Unless additional resources are provided for areas where the need is greater, the principle that the Minister outlined will not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that the necessary resources will be provided in areas where there is a greater need and that that need will be based on the social and economic polity of the area rather than on criteria set by his Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall clear up an issue which I am sure was due to a slip of the tongue. The trusts are providers, not purchasers. The purchasers in this instance would be the boards, which would set the level of service that they required. That is why I said that hon. Members could be reasonably assured that there would be a general-quality of provision across the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to resources, if the timetable for the order is as we envisaged, the proposals will come into effect in 1995—the next financial year—although certain preparation expenses might fall into the financial year starting on 1 April 1994. The implications of the order for resources will have to be taken into account, but the hon. Gentleman should not expect me to talk about specific resource implications at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued that the boards would be given overall criteria and that they would keep to them. That has not been the experience with other boards, such as those relating to education, over which he has charge. When representations are made, we are told what other boards do differently, and that if we lived in different areas, we could get what we needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hub of the matter is resources. If the resources are not there, the boards cannot help, no matter how great their will may be. That has been the experience of other boards. It is not good enough to say that the boards will all act to a certain standard. If the resources are not there, there will be no service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the words that I used: the trusts will be expected to comply with departmental guidance. I hope that the combination of the three bodies acting together will ensure the equity of provision which I think concerns members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the money is not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have told the hon. Gentleman that we are projecting into the future. I am sure that he would not expect me to talk about figures now. It would be foolish to make such projections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, who takes great interest in the debate, has heard hon. Members' comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to departmental guidance being offered to boards. Can he give us an undertaking that any such guidance will be published? Far too often in such cases there is far too much secrecy about how Northern Ireland departments operate. We do not have the same range of published material in Northern Ireland as hon. Members have in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of pre-empting my noble Friend, I understand that it was intended to publish the guidance anyway—but I hear the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon Members, including the hon Members for Eccles (Miss Lestor) and for Normanton, asked about the report to Parliament made under the Children Act on the mainland. It was considered that a direct equivalent might not be appropriate, given the differences in the court and social services structures in northern Ireland. However, I can assure the Committee that consideration will be given to the best means of providing Parliament with information on the operation of the legislation. That is important, although I do not want to pre-empt how it might be achieved. The point has been well made by hon. Members and will be considered by my noble Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members asked about training. We recognise that training will play an important part in ensuring the success of the order. Arrangements have been put in hand for the creation of a training and dissemination group to ensure that the principles underpinning the order are widely communicated, not only though formal training but through the provision of literature on the legislation. That there should be consistency in the understanding of those principles is most important, and co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors is intended. It is anticipated that the philosophy underlying the document about training together which was produced for the Children Act will be followed, so that, when possible, those from different disciplines will train to ensure that there is a common awareness of the aims and objectives of the new order. In a sense, that also covers the point about levelness and quality of provision throughout the Province. That, too, is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities are responsible for training social workers and the back-up service in England and Wales. Under this legislation, who will be responsible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
for overall training procedures? Will it be the trust boards, the health and social services board, or the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be the Department. Indeed, the costs of training health and social services staff will fall to the Department of Health and Social Services. The Department is considering the support that might be given to training in the voluntary sector, too. Much thought has been given to the matter, and rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of small homes and whether they should be registered. At present, there are no privately registered homes in Northern Ireland. The point that homes providing accommodation for fewer than four children should be subject to registration will be considered. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster raised several important matters, some of which I have already covered. In particular, he again asked about the definition of "significant harm". The criteria that must be satisfied before a child can be taken into care are set out in article 50, to which he referred. Under article 50(2)(a), the child must be suffering or
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to suffer, significant harm".</p></blockquote>
Under article 2, "harm" is defined to include ill-treatment or the impairment of health, including mental health. "Ill treatment" is further defined in article 2 to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"sexual abuse and forms of ill-treatment which are not physical".</p></blockquote>
Guidance on whether harm is significant is provided in article 50(3), which sets out clearly that the significance of any harm may be determined with reference to the health or development of the child, compared with what might be expected "of a similar child."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are clearly defined minimum criteria and it is important that discretion is exercised. Further, to define "significant harm" would risk creating borderline cases. It may be difficult to decide where a case falls. I say again to the hon. Gentleman that drawing firm lines in such matters could disadvantage certain individuals, because the lines were too tightly drawn. I hope that he considers that there is sufficient definition, without falling into the trap of over-defining and causing black-and-white cases, in respect of which people may suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must still accept that that is unacceptable. Therefore, I hope that the Minister and Baroness Denton will further consider the matter. The terms "a similar child" and "significant harm" are open to wide-ranging interpretation across the Province. Therefore, we are not satisfied that tightening up will benefit a child. We should have the best interests of the child at heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. We are both on the same wavelength. We may be considering the dangers that exist either way. I have explained to the hon. Gentleman the reasons for our view. Equally, I shall pass on his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
The hon. Gentleman aslo asked why the order does not specify an age below which it would be illegal to leave children along. We recognise the concern that has arisen about young children being left along. There is a problem about where to draw the line. For example, the response to a question about whether it is reasonable for a 12-year old to be left along or in charge of a younger child is likely to depend on the length of the parents' absence and the circumstances of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful that criminal law does not intrude unnecessarily into family life when the absence of a parent or other responsible adult is short-term and when a criminal sanction is unlikely to be enforceable. Equally, by setting an arbitrary age limit, we do not wish to indicate that it is acceptable to leave children alone simply because one of them has reached that age. The hon. Gentleman raised an important matter, but other considerations have to be set in the balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the draft order provides that if a child is to be left for two hours or more with a person, that person must be registered. The Department is acknowledging that there is a set period and a set standard. There should be a standard for the limit on leaving a child alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Acram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and shall ensure that his remarks are passed to my right hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have asked about the emergency protection orders and the length of time that they should apply for. I have been given a complicated piece of paper on which is stated the reasons why there is not a set definition of working days. I can discuss that if hon. Members wish it. Article 64(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An emergency protection order shall have effect for such period, not exceeding eight days, as may be specified in the order."</p></blockquote>
By virtue of section 39(4) of the Interpretation (Northern Ireland) Act 1954, where the time that is limited for undertaking an act falls or expires on a Sunday or public holiday, the act may be done on the next following day that is not a Sunday or public holiday. That will exclude a Sunday or public holiday from the calculation of the eight-day period when such days fall on the eighth day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At risk of becoming overtechnical, I referred to the 1954 Act and understand that, therefore, the point is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the provision that, if necessary, the order may be extended by a maximum of seven days if the court is satisfied that that is necessary to protect a child from significant harm. That is sufficient time for an investigation to be completed. There is a balance; we do not want to overdo the protection order and do psychological or family damage to a child when that is not strictly necessary. A degree of flexibility has been build in and it is an important part of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry for delaying the Minister, but this is important. People working in professional and voluntary organisations do not believe that eight days is satisfactory. It is suggested in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
document mentioned by the hon. Member for Belfast, West, which we shall submit to the Minister, that 15 days may be best. Eight days is not acceptable because there are difficulties reaching a magistrate during holiday periods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have dealt with the question of holidays. The further seven days, addes to the eight when necessary, makes 15 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could accept 15 days very easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where necessary, 15 days are provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about parental responsibility and requested that it be clarified. The order deliberately stresses the continuing nature of parental responsibility. Parental responsibility cannot generally be taken away, but it is clear in practical terms that a person cannot exercise parental responsibility in a way that is incompatible with a child's welfare. That deals with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South suggested that I should take guidance. I assure him that, when necessary, I shall do so. He asked about preventive services and whether they would be damaged by the order. The order makes it clear that support is to be given to children and their families to avoid the need for children to be taken into care and to prevent neglect and abuse. The provisions are in part IV and in schedule 2 of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear framework for the preventive aspects of child care. Where a board is under a duty to provide such services and fails to do so, the order provides for a complaint to be made. The Government appreciate the importance of the preventive services. I hope that the hon. Gentleman thinks that that issue has been dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that include financial aspects, which hitherto have been dealt with by slippage money? Trusts will purchase those services and sometimes provide them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than risk misleading the hon. Gentleman, I shall take advice and guidance on that matter and write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members asked about excluding abusers from the family home. The hon. Members for Eccles and others made important comments on that. We recognise the widespread view that, in some cases, it is not the childs but the alleged abuser who should be removed from the family home. The proposed order includes a provision for a board to asist a person who is living in the child's home to live elsewhere if that would promote the wefare of the child—I emphasise the word "assist".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition to the order of a provision that would compel the removal of an alleged abuser would require careful consideration to ensure that it achieved the desired
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
outcome. It raises substantial issues—for example, how the rights of a person agianst whom such an order was made would be protected. Would applications for such an order be made ex parte? For how long would such an order have effect? Many important considerations would have to be put into the balance, and hon. Members will agree that there is a difficult balance to be struck. Whether an acceptable formula could be developed and incorporated in the order is a matter that will require careful consideration. I have listened to what hon. Members said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Belfast, South and for Belfast, West both referred to the need for the Government to improve vetting procedures. The hon. Member for Eccles also spoke about vetting. The Government welcomed the recently published Houston report and recognise that it raised serious issues. The recommendations are far reaching and suggest fundamental changes to the present system. My noble Friend has announced a review of the Department's pre-employment consultancy service, which will begin as soon as possible. It is intended that progress on implementing the recommendations will be reviewed in 12 months. I hope that hon. Members will realise that the report requires not a knee-jerk reaction, but serious consideration to ensure that the right answer is reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the sensitivity of the situation. Workers in the statutory field are vetted, but much work is done on a voluntary basis. Surely now is the time to tighten up the regulations. I refer not to the plethora of youth organisations, but to specific work associated with young people. I urge the Minister that we should not wait a year before we learn the lesson that has been outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have heard what the hon. Gentleman has said, and I shall ensure that my noble Friend is aware of his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, West raised several issues that I hope I have already covered. On the phraseology of the definition of children with disabilities, I understand that one expression in particular has caused offence. The definition of a disabled person in article 2 of the proposed order follows the definition in the Children Act 1989 and the wording of section 1 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1978. Clearly, we must be careful to avoid anomalies which could arise if we used different terminology in different legislation, but it is accepted that the words may appear to be rather old fashioned and in some cases offensive, and we shall consider the options for amending them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) raised various matters with which I have dealt, but he also mentioned the independence of guardians ad litem. The Government recognised the key importance of the guardian ad litem as a representative of the child and his interests in certain proceedings under the order. The creation of an effective guardian ad litem service will be essential to the successful operation of the order. The detailed arrangements have yet to be finalised, but it is envisaged that the service will operate as an independent body, separate from the health and social service branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The hon. Gentleman and hon. Member for Eccles asked about the provision of a child advocacy service. That may be a useful means of underpinning the principles of the order. Such a service would have to be independent if it is to be fully effective. The voluntary sector might have a significant role to play in such an area. If detailed proposals can be put forward, I am sure that the Department of Health and Social Services would be prepared to consider what support might be made available. I leave that matter for hon. Members and others to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of resources has been raised. I dealt with them to an extent in answer to the question from the hon. Member for Antrim, North. Implementation of the order will entail additional costs, such as in the proposed new requirement to appoint guardians ad litem in care and care-related proceedings and in the development and expansion of personal social service with children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will also be additional costs for training in awareness in relation to the new legislation. It is anticipated that most costs will not be incurred until the 1995–96 financial year. But those costs exist and, in introducing the order, the Governent are aware of their implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) raised specific questions. I hope that he will allow me to write to him about them as they were very very detailed. I wish to ensure that my answers are correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eccles again raised several questions, specifically about housing. She referred to a report, which I have not had the benefit of reading. I hope that she will allow me to make inquiries about the report and write to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
I hope that I have covered the salients points that were raised in what has been a helpful and constructive debate. We highlighted several important issues affecting some of the most vulnerable members of society. I assure the Committee that comments made today will be considered before further action on the order is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will not need to be reminded of the difficult issues that arise when we deal with the question of welfare of children. I was grateful to feel—I hope correctly—that there was general welcome for the principles behind the order. With some confidence drawn from that, we can move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed legislation has been long awaited. Even after its enactment, a substantial amount of time will be needed to prepare for implementation. There are important matters that require consideration. We hope to lay a draft order within the next few months for the approval of Parliament so that a modern and comprehensive framework of child care law for Northern Ireland can be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
