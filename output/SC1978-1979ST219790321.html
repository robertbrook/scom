	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Meat and Livestock Commission Levy Scheme (Confirmation) Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
The effect of this scheme is, firstly, to revoke and replace the Meat and Livestock Commission levy scheme 1968, consolidating various amendments. It thus provides for the continuation of the system under which the Commission is enabled to impose charges to meet its expenses and to recover such charges. Secondly, the scheme makes two changes to the existing provisions. These are an increase in the maximum charge leviable in respect of each head of sheep from 8p to 16p, and an extension of the leviable charges to exports of livestock, excluding pure-bred breeding cattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory maximum rates of levy were last increased four year ago, in 1975, and it is to the credit of the Commission that it has been able for so long to work within the present limits while maintaining and developing a wide range of services to the industry. I should like to say something about these services before discussing the changes in the levy scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Meat and Livestock Commission was set up in 1968, the pattern of the meat industry's development was uneven. The Government believed that the Commission had an important role to play in furthering the development of the livestock and livestock products industries, to the benefit of producers and consumers. Subsequent events proved this to be true. The Commission now provides a range of services to the industry which has brought, I am sure many will agree, substantial improvements which were unlikely to have occurred had matters been left to the operation of normal market arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1975 the Commission has continued its livestock improvement work, its
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
marketing and economic services, fatstock certification, weighing and classification services and its support for scientific projects. All have played essential roles in the industry's progress and development. Fresh ground has been broken in several important areas. For example, there has been the start of the retail meat price reporting service, supplying information now used by news media all over the country. The meat industry development and advisory service, operated in conjunction with the Meat Research Institute, has been launched. Also, perhaps of most significance, the Meat Promotion Executive, launched nearly four years ago, has steadily developed its role as a powerful stimulus to the demand for British meat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Carcase classification schemes for cattle, sheep and pigs have continued as a major element in the Commission's programme. But while the pig scheme has maintained its success, with nearly 80 per cent, of clean pigs slaughtered being covered in the year 1977–78, the numbers classified under the other two schemes have been at a much lower level. The significance of these schemes is underlined by the prospect of an EEC classification scheme for beef and, possibly, one for sheep. The Government share the Commission's view that the development of our British schemes should make a positive contribution to the introduction of any EEC schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is required to present annual reports and accounts to Ministers, and copies of these are laid before Parliament. The report for the year ending 31 March 1978 shows in considerable detail the wide range of the Commission's activities, and for this reason I do not propose to dwell on them further. I should like to take this opportunity of commending the Chairman and the other Commissioners on the way in which they have discharged their statutory duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been one further development since 1975 which should perhaps be mentioned. The production and distribution advisory committees provided for in the Agriculture Act 1967 failed to meet the wishes either of committee members themselves or of the organisations represented. The Commission concluded that there was a need for a review of the structure, and this was duly carried out. As hon. Members may recall, the outcome was that under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, these committees were abolished and replaced by a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
system of direct consultation of organisations representing the different interests in the production and distribution sectors of the industry. I think that hon. Members who remember the Act, particularly the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), who took part in the debate, will recall that the Consumers' Committee was, however, retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of these changes, a widely-based industry forum was set up, and this is now the body which the Commission customarily consults on matters of interest to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the crucial issue of the Commission's financial position. Like everyone else, it is beset by inflationary pressures which are placing a severe strain on its resources. During recent months it has accordingly made a rigorous examination of its level of expenditure on levy-funded activities and has made a number of cuts in its budget for the financial year 1978–79. Despite this, it is estimated that there will be a deficit for the year of some £450,000, which will come out of its reserves. It has further estimated that in default of increased levy income it will incur deficits of £530,000 in 1979–80 and of £850,000 in 1980–81, making a total of £1,830,000. These deficits must be met by increased income from levies. Clearly, the present state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission therefore proposes to raise the levies as follows. The levy on cattle will be increased under existing statutory powers from 78p to the statutory maximum of 90p—a rise of 12p. Under the draft order now before the House, the levy on sheep would be increased from 8p to 16p and half of the revenue from this increase would go for meat promotion. In addition, the Commission intends to raise the pig levy by 8p for meat promotion purposes. The increase on pigs can, like that on cattle, be contained within the existing statutory maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These proposed increases, and indeed the level of the Commission's levy-funded activities, have been the subject of very thorough consultation with the industry during recent months. There is a wide measure of agreement on the proposed increases to cover expenditure on meat promotion. There has been criticism from some sectors of the industry, both on the general level of the Commission's activities and on the size of the proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
increase on the maximum rate for sheep. The Government appreciate the force of these criticisms, coming as they do from sectors of the industry which are themselves under economic pressure, but we believe that it is essential that the Commission should be given the means to get its financial resources back into equilibrium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The search for economies will, however, continue, and I welcome the Commission's resolve in this matter. Its decision to set up an independent study group to review its commercial beef and sheep recording services—which take up a significant proportion of its resources—is very much indicative of that resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other new provision in the levy scheme: the proposal to extend the levy to exports of live animals. This is being introduced because the Commission and the industry believe amongst other things, that as exporters benefit from the Commission's various services in much the same way as do those engaged exclusively in the home market, they should bear the levy on an equal basis. So this is a measure to restore equity in the raising of revenue from the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one exception to this provision. Exporters of dairy cattle intended for breeding do not benefit from the work of the Commission, and it would be inequitable for them to bear the levy. For practicality of administration, it is proposed that the exemption should apply to all pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, of course, aware that exporters of livestock may regard this levy as something of a disincentive. But I think that it should be placed in its proper perspective. The levy will represent a tiny fraction of the value of the animal. I do not consider that a charge of the order proposed will be at all unreasonable, bearing in mind the desirability of treating all trade on an equitable basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely understandable that, in a period of economic difficulty for the meat and livestock industry—which, after all, is the Commission's paymaster—there should be considerable pressure on the Commission to reduce its level of expenditure substantially. But I believe all sectors of the industry recognise that such a body is needed, and that it must have sufficient resources to do its job. I believe also that the Commission is responsive to the need for economy, consistent with an adequate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
level of services. This order will enable it to recover its financial balance, so to speak, and thus enable it to continue its task of promoting the greater efficiency of the meat and livestock industry in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must begin by declaring my interest as a farmer. We are grateful to the Minister of State. He has gone into a number of points which surround the changes which have been proposed by the Government on the recommendation of the Commission, but there are several matters which I should like to raise this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that at present quangos come under criticism and public scrutiny. It is a fact that there are, in general, too many quangos and that too often they tend to be extravagant. However, I have always felt that, of the agricultural quangos, the Meat and Livestock Commission is one of the more difficult to criticise. If one asks what the Meat and Livestock Commission does and who benefits from it, the Commission is able to justify its existence and the benefits which it passes on to the industry are better than those of some of the other quangos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year I received a paper, dated 20 October, from Dr. Baker, the livestock director of the Commission, which enclosed a comment on the livestock improvement programme which the Commission pursues. I draw the Committee's attention to one paragraph which epitomises a great deal of the good the Commission does:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The central testing of pigs currently costs £262,000 per annum. It is possible to monitor the effects of this programme with reasonable accuracy and it is calculated to benefit the Industry by about £3 million per annum through reduced feeding costs and better carcases."</p></blockquote>
The Commission indulges in other projects particularly on beef and, to a lesser extent, in the sheep sector. Perhaps these other programmes are not so easy to evaluate in such clear terms as the central testing of pigs, but without doubt there are a great many other benefits in other parts of the Commission's programme which would be comparable to the figure I have quoted and the justification I have suggested. Therefore, I do not intend this morning to make a great haran-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
gue against the activities of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us have been grateful to receive from the Commission a letter and note, dated 15 March, giving some of the background to these changes from the Commission's point of view. The Commission points out that the growing deficit in its finances is due to three factors. First, there has been no increase in levies since 1975—the Commission has not come to the House of Commons and asked for increases in its maximum since that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister of State was somewhat glowing in his commendation of the Commission for not having been back to ask for its maximum rates to be changed since 1975, to be fair one must recall that when it did last come back the proposals it made were for a number of years ahead. Thus, we should not have expected it to have come back very much before now. I am not saying that as being a snide way of attacking the Commission's efforts to withhold the ravages of inflation—which is the second reason for the deficit in which it finds itself. As we all know, we have suffered since 1974–75 from as bad a spate of inflation as this country has ever known, with the cost of food going up by 115 per cent, and the cost of living index doubling, a matter not very much to the credit of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the final reason that the Commission suggests as to why it has run into a deficit. It says: that income to the Commission has been reduced by the decrease in the number of animals slaugtered. That seems a funny state of affairs, because it was just about this time in 1975 when the former Minister, now Lord Peart, introduced that strange White Paper to the House "Food from Our Own Resources", in which it was proposed that there was to be an expansion in our food production. It was suggested in that paper that it might be a good idea if we produced extra food to the tune of about 2½ per cent, a year. I know the Minister of State will tell me that that was a broad target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever the Opposition attack the Government for not having lived up to the targets which they set themselves in "Food from Our Own Resources", they rather patronisingly ask us whether we knew that there was a drought in 1976 and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
was our fault as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will get his chance to speak in a moment. Did we not remember that there was a drought in 1975 and 1976? I believe those were the years of drought. But a drought affects only the yields in the summer. We understand that the potato crop was very much reduced, and therefore the value in total output of the industry was somewhat inhibited. But how the Government can argue that the drought caused a decrease in the number of animals slaughtered I am not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission says it has run into deficit because of a decrease in the number of animals slaughtered. I should have thought that that was an entire justification for the attacks that we have been making on the Government for printing a White Paper one year and presiding over a decline in the size of the livestock industry in subsequent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, what this reason for the budgeted increasing deficit of the Meat and Livestock Commission amounts to is a reflection of the policy of the Government of allowing the green pound deficit to grow larger and larger and to allow the market in this country to be more and more open to our competitors in the rest of the Community. I hope that within the next few weeks the electorate will have an opportunity of doing something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the new proposals which are being suggested. I have a table, attached to the letter from the Meat and Livestock Commission, which shows what the financial effect will be of making the changes we are invited to accept this morning. As I understand it, a move to the maximum permitted rate on cattle of 90 pence per head, which is an increase of 12 pence, is estimated to yield £382,000. According to my arithmetic, that implies that the total yield of levy from cattle will be just under £3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we can leave the levy relating to calves out of our calculations this morning. But in regard to sheep I estimate that the effect of the doubling of the levy from 8p to 16p would yield a total of £974,000. That implies that if the full levy of 16p were to be applied, the total levy income to the Commission from sheep slaughtering would be just under £2 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, to move to the maximum rate
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
for pigs of 30p a head—an increase of 8p—would yield just over £1 million, implies that the total income from the levy on pigs would be just under £4 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the balance between the income from the various sectors in the livestock industry—cattle yield just under £3 million, sheep just under £2 million and pigs just under £4 million—it seems that this balance is a very different balance from the total value of those livestock at slaughter. I turned immediately to the current annual review of agriculture—the White Paper of 1979. I compared the information in table 21 on page 36 with the total value of these sectors of livestock in terms of the output of the industry. There one sees a very different balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister of State will tell me that the reason that the income received from the industry by the Meat and Livestock Commission is not in balance with the total value of the slaughterings is that the Commission is more or less heavily involved in programmes for each sector. I know that he will argue, rightly, that the high level of levy charged on pigs reflects the heavy amount of work done by the Commission in the pig sector. Of course, the pig industry, with its quick life cycle and its enclosed and controlled housing environment, makes it much more adaptable to the kind of work carried out by the Commission. I quite understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for raising the point is that I should like the Minister to justify the doubling of the levy on the sheep sector. The Commission is proposing to raise almost another £1 million a year from the sheep sector. That is a lot of money. I should like the Minister to tell us what the Commission will do in terms of extra promotion, which I understand is to receive half of the increased new yield, and what the Commission will do in terms of livestock improvement schemes, in order to justify that increased return of almost £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that there has been a certain amount of criticism from the industry about the rise in the sheep levy. I quite understand why those people interested in that sector should have been concerned. Therefore, it would be helpful to have an explanation of how that money will be spent. I am sure that the Minister would agree that when his remarks come to be read outside the House of Commons, there will be many people in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
sheep sector who will want to know how the Government justify their approval of the doubling of the levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the proposals which refer to exporting. I am concerned particularly about two aspects of the exporting proposals. First, I am anxious about paragraph 4 in the schedule to the order, which says that a levy may be made
	<br><blockquote><p>"to livestock (other than pure bred breeding animals of the bovine species) exported by an exporter."</p></blockquote>
Why has the term "pure bred" been included in the order? In breeding matters and genetic improvement, I know that the position of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been archaic in the extreme. This has been reflected over the years by the attitudes of the Minister's advisers towards livestock improvement. I am thinking of matters such as bull licensing, over which his advisers took the most crude and old-fashioned view for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the position of people who want to export cross-bred animals for breeding—pigs and sheep—which would attract a charge under the levy? I do not know offhand to what extent there is a market for the export of cross-bred animals for breeding. I know that a large sector of the livestock industry in this country depends on cross-bred animals. I have cross-bred black Hereford and Here-ford-Friesian cross cows on my own farm, and I suppose that it could be argued that they are Britain's premier female beef type. They are not pure-bred but, clearly, cross-bred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Minister should have insisted on including only pure-bred breeding animals. Right through the north of England a large proportion of the female breeding types in the sheep sector are cross-bred animals. The bulk of the breeding sheep are cross-bred ewes. There is a growing use of cross-bred animals in the pig sector. I cannot understand why the term "pure bred" has been included in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State may recall that in another Committee last week—that considering the Countryside Bill, with which we were both involved—I put down an amendment to add to the term "pure bred" the term "cross bred" as well. On that occasion I believe that the Minister of State, or one of his colleagues on the Front Bench, agreed to consider the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
amendment before Report. I do not understand why the term has crept into this order. I know that the Minister's advisers find it almost impossible to imagine that anything worth using for breeding can be anything other than pure-bred, but I plead with the Minister to look into this matter.

The other matter I want to raise under paragraph 4 of the schedule has been drawn to my attention by letters written to my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) and to my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) by the National Pig Breeders' Association. The association queries why the proposal in paragraph 4 exempts from the export levy livestock which are pure-bred breeding cattle, while a levy is to be imposed on pigs and sheep. Mr. Manchester, the secretary of the NPBA, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am also advised that in the case of cattle, it is not proposed to raise a levy on pure bred breeding animals although a levy will be charged on pigs and sheep.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It appears illogical to this Association to exempt cattle from this Order but to include the other two species. It is very much hoped, therefore, that steps can be taken to exclude breeding animals of any species from the Order."</p></blockquote>
I do not know that I agree with that. There is a logical case for excluding breeding animals, because they do not come within the ambit of the work of these levies, which are based on slaughter. It would be an unjustifiable charge to make on people who were involved in the exporting of breeding animals. But I can see no justification for excluding cattle and including pigs and sheep. I hope that we shall have an explanation from the Minister on that point, as, to me, it seems unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that there would be an opportunity for abuse. Perhaps that would be his argument. However, with the system of licences, and with a system, maybe, of pricing—one can always tell by the price charged for breeding animals being more than their slaughter value—I should have thought that it would be perfectly easy to make arrangements whereby the price charged for these animals could reflect whether they were being exported for slaughter or for breeding purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised a number of points, and I should be grateful if the Minister would be good enough to comment on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.2 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is as well to remember that the Meat and Livestock Commission came into being because the industty funked the issue of a proper fully-fledged meat marketing scheme. I do not include in that the Council of the National Farmers' Union, as when this matter was put to the industry on the two previous occasions it was with the recommendation of the NFU Council that there should be a meat marketing scheme. Indeed, it went out to the counties, and they said "No."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say this in criticism of the Commission, but we should remember that in this sense, we have got something inadequate and second-rate as regards the job that needs doing in the meat and livestock sectors of the industry. It is probably too late to go far down that road and thinking in terms of a fully-fledged meat marketing scheme. Perhaps the answer lies more in the area of the development of producer co-operatives, where there have been some significant developments over the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect, Mr. Goodhew, that if I were to start talking about the inherent cruelty and economic stupidity of the export of live animals for slaughter abroad, you would feel constrained to remind me of the order under discussion. Therefore, I shall, instead say to the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), who drew attention to the statement in the brief which the MLC was kind enough to send to us about the decrease in the number of animals slaughtered in this country, that it is not without significance that since the MLC was last discussed here, about 2½ million animals have been exported for slaughter abroad. That is bound to have some impact on the income of the MLC. With the benefit of hindsight, I am bound to say that it is incredible that the MLC did not come to us earlier to seek to have these animals included in the levy scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my money, if that were to act as some disincentive—although, unhappily, I do not think that it will—to those engaging in such a vile trade, I would welcome it. I am sorry that our procedure does not allow us to put a more punitive levy on animals sent abroad for slaughter. As I have said, we are talking of animals going at the rate of 2,400 a day, every day of the year. Of course, producers have had the benefit of much of the work which the MLC has done and is still attempting to do.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
We should like to see that work continued and, in some areas, expanded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly puzzled that the order makes no distinction in regard to the levy payable on cattle exported for immediate slaughter or for further fattening. In other areas, my right hon. Friend and his Department tell us that there is the world of difference between those two issues. Indeed, the export licences which have to be acquired pretend to make that distinction. I am not objecting to the distinction but trying to understand it. Will the Minister tell the Committee why he and the MLC felt it right not to make a distinction between live animals sent for immediate slaughter and those sent for further fattening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, of course—I suspect that this is what my right hon. Friend will tell me—there is little difference. If it makes very little difference, perhaps my right hon. Friend's Department and the Department of Trade will stop pretending that there is a difference and acknowledge the case made against this trade—that it is a sham, a farce, and a bid to get export licences which perhaps would not otherwise be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Minister does not intend to say that, perhaps he would say why his Department makes a distinction between live animals sent for immediate slaughter and those sent for further fattening, while his colleagues in Victoria Street at the Department of Trade do not do so. The overseas trade statistics compiled on the basis of the issued certificates, which make this distinction, do not distinguish between these two categories of death—if I may put it that way. Either it is worth making this distinction and following it through or, if we are to do what my right hon. Friend is inviting us to do this morning, it is not worth doing. But I do not see that we can run this two-bit system both within the Ministry of Agriculture and between Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly welcome the proposals of the order in respect of sheep. I am fortunate enough to have the National Sheep Association in my constituency. In recent discussions with the association, I learned that it is working on plans not only to encourage home lamb production but to increase consumption of lamb which has dropped significantly over the past 10 years. That is not because of price, although, clearly, that has had some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
effect; it is because of the idocy of the Common Market and the problems which it puts in the way of the import on New Zealand lamb at a time when it will do nothing to disturb markets either here or in the rest of the Community. Much less lamb has been available for the British housewife to buy. It may be that that is the simple reason why less Iamb is being bought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is enormous scope for the sensible expansion of home lamb production. Behind that lies the possibility of bringing new life and better incomes to farmers on the hill and marginal lands, where much of this expansion can take place. I hope that the MLC will do all it can to assist with this work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.9 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful and interesting debate on the order. At least one may be pleased that on these occasions the work of the MLC is brought before the House of Commons. As I said earlier, its annual reports are submitted, and I am sure that that is helpful to hon. Members, although they do not often have the chance of debating them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the points raised by hon. Members. I agreed with the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) when he paid tribute to the MLC. He raised the matter of quangos generally. Without going into that subject this morning, I would say that those of us who have been in close touch with some of these organisations recognise the substantial work that they do and their accountability to the industry, the public and Parliament. The MLC is no exception. In bringing these proposals before the Committee today, the officers and members of the MLC have all made a substantial contribution in order to try to accommodate the various interests involved in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the amounts raised, a question has been put about the sheep sector. I should have made it clear that we are discussing an enabling measure. We are not necessarily raising all the levies to these levels. As I said, the Commission can still raise the levy on cattle, calves and pigs, but for sheep we have raised the limits so that the maximum levels can be used as and how it is wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of why sheep should be singled out particularly was raised by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
hon. Member for Westmorland. We all know that the sheep sector has been doing reasonably well, while some sectors of our industry have not done so well. However, we must look at the relationship between the levy income and the allocation of the levy-financed expenditure between the various sectors. This shows that the share of expenditure attributed to the sheep sector has been much greater than the proportion it has contributed to the total levy income. I have figures, adjusted for inflation, for the nine and a half years to 31 March 1978. They show expenditure of 46.3 per cent for pigs, 33.8 per cent for cattle and calves and 19.9 per cent for sheep. The income for sheep was 9.2 per cent. Therefore, the sheep sector has had a substantial benefit from the amount of levy that has been paid. I believe that the view of the Commission was that this was one area in which raising the level of the levy was particularly justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the effect of the levy on prices to the consumer, I think that it has always been contended that the cost effect of the levy applied at the point of slaughter is spread throughout the whole marketing system, tending to be passed back to the producer in times of plentiful supplies, or forward to the retailer and consumer in times of shortage. However, even if the increase in the levy were to be passed on to the consumer, its effect would be a price increase of no more than about 0.5 per pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When talking about the state of the industry, one is saying that this levy and the work of the MLC is an investment—an improvement—in the many other services which the Commission provides for the benefit of the industry, especially at a time when the various sectors of the industry may have been undergoing hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland talks about our record in the last few years. I remember that in 1974 and 1975—perhaps in 1976 too, which was the year of the drought—the industry was facing a severe problem of over-production. Probably it had been encouraged by our predecessors. I do not want to make anything of that this morning, except, of course, to say that the over-production had its effect on the market at that time and on confidence in the years from 1976. It is true that 1976 was the worst drought year for several centuries. Therefore, without making excuses, I explain the situation here. In those days what we called "the Peart
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
premium" was brought in, because we did not believe that beef should go into intervention. That, fortunately, has been carried on. These factors must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I think that the beef premium was introduced in 1974.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the well-known term "the Peart premium." I am not making a point of this. There was overproduction which had its effect on the market and on future production by the industry. These are relevant factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the state of the market generally, the average returns on fat cattle in 1978 were about 16 per cent up on 1977, and producer prices in Great Britain have been above target price levels for almost a year. The prices for calves and cattle are well up, thereby showing producer confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the premium, target prices from April onwards will depend on the outcome of the Council of Agricultural Ministers' meeting on 26 and 27 March. An announcement will be made about target prices. The industry has been well above target for some time. Not since last April has there been a need to resort to the target price, so there has been quite a good return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pig industry has had its difficulties, as we all know. We recognise that the MCAs in the pigmeat sector continue to be of major concern. The industry recognises that we have continued to press hard for reductions in face of strong opposition in the Community, and a flat 15 per cent cut was secured in the MCAs over the last two years. We are still hopeful of securing further improvements in this year's CAP price fixing negotiations. The 5 per cent devaluation will cut MCAs by about 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the export of animals—my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) referred to exports—there is the wider aspect of animal welfare. We have taken the view that we should ensure that the welfare regulations are complied with and strictly enforced. However, this matter will be under consideration by the House on another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the levy on the export of live animals, a number of organisations have been consulted by the MLC and by the agriculture Departments. The National Cattle Breeders' Association, the National
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Pig Breeders' Association and others with an interest in the export of live animals have made their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We and the MLC claim that the levy will correct an anomaly by requiring exporters to pay for the services they receive from the MLC in the same way as other meat traders. This seems to us to be a matter of common justice within the industry and between the exporters and those who believe in slaughter at home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland asked about the exclusion for breeding cattle and why the order was limited to pure bred animals. The exclusion was introduced to cover dairy animals which, as I have said, do not benefit from the activities of the MLC. The wording to which the hon. Gentleman objects reflects the wording of the customs tariff. The limitation to pure bred animals also reflects the difficulties of administering a more broadly defined category for exclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister said that the classification by the Department of Trade allowed a wider grouping. That was exactly my point. It does not. This exclusion for breeding animals ought to be wider to include pure-bred and crossbred animals for breeding, because of current and growing practice within the industry. The Minister cannot justify that by saying that the definition gives a broader classification. It does nothing of the sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can clarify the position. The MLC in response to pressure from sections of the industry, has taken the view that, since exporters of animals may be assumed to benefit from the general services in much the same way as traders engaged solely in the home market, it would be equitable for them to bear the levy at the normal rates. For ease of administration and other reasons, the MLC considers that, with one exception, the levy should apply to all live animals whether exported for immediate slaughter, fattening or breeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exception relates to pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species. Representations have been made by the National Cattle Breeders' Association and the British Friesian Cattle Society that, as dairy animals exported for breeding do not benefit from the MLC services, they should be exempt. That was considered to be a reasonable objection because, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
practice, it might be difficult to differentiate between beef animals and dairy animals. The exemption is worded to cover both types. Cross-bred animals are clearly more difficult to identify. Therefore, they have not been brought within the scope of the exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Pig Breeders' Association also objected to the levy, with particular reference to breeding pigs. My right hon. Friend, who received similar correspondence from Mr. Manchester, appreciates the pig breeders' concern about the introduction of the levy on exports. But the purpose of the measure, proposed by the Meat and Livestock Commission, was to meet a widespread concern in the industry that exporters who benefit from the Commission's services do not contribute to the cost of those services in the same way as other sections of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission provides a range of services—livestock improvement activities, recording, testing and market information services—which are of direct benefit to exporters, including exporters of breeding pigs. The purpose of excluding pure-bred breeding cattle from the application of the levy was to meet the objection to which I have referred. The same consideration does not apply to exporters of breeding pigs or sheep. We do not, therefore, feel justified in accepting the view put forward by the National Pig Breeders' Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister on this matter. Surely he acknowledges that it is unfair that the man exporting pedigree Aberdeen Angus heifers—a breed used exclusively for beef—should be allowed to do so free of levy, whereas the person exporting pedigree breeding pigs should have to pay? There cannot be any justification for that anomaly. It must be unfair. If that is acknowledged, surely it would be better to exclude all breeding animals from the levy, and that could be done by a reference to the price. If the price at which the breeding animals had been exchanged was significantly higher than their slaughter value, that would clearly establish that they were breeding animals. Would not that be a better way of going about the matter? The Minister must acknowledge that there is a serious anomaly here between beef cattle and pure-bred sheep and pigs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This really is a matter for the MLC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for the right hon. Gentleman. It is his order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are putting forward the recommendations of the MLC. In practice, it is difficult to differentiate between beef and dairy animals. That is why this wording has been used to cover both types. Cross-bred animals, which are more difficult to identify, are not brought within the scope of the exemption. The term
	<br><blockquote><p>"pure bred breeding animals of the bovine species"</p></blockquote>
is not defined in the scheme. It is a matter for the Commission and for Customs and Excise to decide how this shall be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Commission for having dealt with aspects which were of great concern to the various parts of the industry—the abattoirs, the slaughtering industry, the breeders and others. I believe that the MLC, whose existence no one challenges, must be allowed to continue its work, albeit in close consultation with the industry, and have sufficient income to enable it to do so. The levy rates which it is proposed should be introduced next month are, in our estimation, the minimum necessary to combat the financial pressures which the Commission is now meeting. Neither the Commission nor anyone else can foretell how long these rates will last, but the expressions of support for the scheme from hon. Members will be an encouragement to the Commission and its staff as they seek to maintain the high standard of service to our meat and livestock industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the future holds for the industry, this kind of investment will be for the benefit of our industry and will help to be competitive in the future.

I trust that the Committee will support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
