	<i>proposed</i> [29

	<i>Mr. Booth.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the headlong rush during the early hours of Wednesday morning to make as much progress as was consistent with a respectable examination of the Bill, I moved amendment No. 110 with what the Minister very fairly described as commendable brevity. I hope that when we deal with these matters with commendable brevity we provoke a constructive response from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue relates to whether, in considering applications for road service licences by people who are operating tours or excursions, the commissioners should consider them under the first or the second leg of subsection (1). If they decide that they are competing with established stage carriage services in the area, they will be considered under the first leg. Presumably the commissioners can then turn down the applications on the ground that the proposed service for a tour or excursion is already adequately covered by stage carriage arrangements in the area. That is particularly true if one accepts the present wording of the clause, which refers to competing "directly". Presumably, if there were an application to run a service which had exactly the same effect on passenger transport within a much narrower time range the commissioners could turn it down because the exact service was already available and there was no evidence that it could not cope with the passenger demand on the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another consideration gives rise to the amendment. It could be held that the slightest variation between what was
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
proposed as an excursion or tour and what was already in existence was not competing "directly". It could be argued that it was an indirect form of competition and, therefore, would not fall to be considered under subsection (1)(a). Presumably, the commissioners would then have to be convinced that it was laid on to deal with a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the area with which the amendment deals. It proposes that if the commissioners receive an application for a tour or excursion they have to be satisfied that the proposed service would not compete "in any way" with other road services for which a licence had already been granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister would like to reply now on that point, I shall gladly sit down. We may then consider whether we need to deal with the more difficult aspect that follows from the way in which the definition of the services, which flows from our decision on the express coach, has a bearing on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember with as much clarity as I, the details of the argument proposed by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) at our last sitting. I am grateful to him for summing up his argument and reminding us of the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to encroach upon the clause stand part debate, but I think that it is necessary to describe the setting of the amendment, particularly as the right hon. Gentleman talked about an application being refused if the condition were not satisfied. In clause 9 we are dealing with what I might call—I am deliberately keeping away from the language of the Bill—a short-cut procedure for those excursions and tours that are not likely to have any adverse effect on stage carriage services. The commissioners would grant an application for a road service licence for an excursion and tour, if they were satisfied that the service would not compete directly with any stage carriage service. There would be no question of hearings, inviting evidence or attaching conditions. If they were not satisfied that there was no competition they would not just reject the application, but would go on to the full process of considering the road service licence. They would decide that it was not a "section 9" case, but an ordinary applica-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
tion because there were competing interests to be considered. Therefore, clause 5(2) to (4), and clauses 6 and 7 would apply. The whole process of inviting representation and having regard to the traffic plans for the area, and so on, would come into play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help me and the Committee by telling us whether it is his intention that regulations will indicate this difference of procedure and that the commissioners should seek a different kind of notification where the applicant thinks his application appropriate under clause 9 for what the Minister has called, rather descriptively, a short-cut procedure. Are there any existing regulations that would guide us on that point? The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that if we are to see this as a short-cut procedure that would operate only where it is accepted that the excursion or tour did not compete with any existing service, it would be advantageous for the applicant to know that that was the case. He would be saved the difficulty of going to the more elaborate procedure normally involved in an application for a road service licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As of now—I shall take the opportunity to correct it later if I am wrong—I do not anticipate a separate form of application. The Bill does not indicate any different type of application. There would be an application for a road service licence and the commissioners, of their own volition, on receiving an application would have to decide, first, whether it was a section 8 case—that is, there are absolutely no other competing transport systems—which need not bother us too much, or a section 9 case, an excursion or tour that does not compete or is a special event. If, on examining it, the commissioners are satisfied that it is a section 9 case, they must issue a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for a regulation to cover that. They will simply sift those applications which they are satisfied come within section 9, for which the Bill obliges them to issue a licence. There is no need to go through the whole process of an ordinary application for a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the precise definition of the competition with which we are concerned. As the Bill stands, the commissioners must be satisfied that the service does not compete "directly". The right hon. Gentleman prefers the phrase
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
"in any way". I think he will agree that we are splitting hairs to an extent. However, it seems to me that the effect of the phrase "in any way" is a more severe test than the word "directly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An excursion or tour around villages or resorts would at some point be almost bound to cover a section of journey that coincides with another stage carriage service, yet the most minute coincidence of the two could be argued as being competition "in any way". The definition preferred in the Bill—"directly"—imports a meaning, and has a real bearing on the commercial position of a service with which there may be competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it is not necessary to stiffen the language in the way that the Opposition propose as the commissioners will have to satisfy themselves that there is no damaging competition before they adopt the procedure. They are experienced in traffic matters, have a background knowledge of stage carriage services, which is a primary duty, and understand transport networks. The requirement that they must be satisfied is quite a heavy one. There must be a clear case before they will use the section 9 procedure. If there is any doubt, and they are not satisfied that the short procedure will apply, there must be a full hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that whether the phrase "are satisfied" is combined with the word "directly", that confines section 9 to only the most clear-cut cases. If one stiffens the requirement to the further extent that the commissioners must be satisfied that the proposed service would not compete "in any way" with any other road service, in a fanciful chain of events the abstraction of just one passenger would be enough to go through the full performance for an excursion or tour licence. That is not necessary. One can trust the commissioners to make sure that clause 9 will not open the way for excursions and tours being permitted if there is the possibility of any real damage to the road service network for which they have a responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in view of that explanation the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness will accept that the Bill intends to confine section 9 to clear-cut cases, that its present wording will enable the commissioners to do that, and that it would be ultra-cautious to stiffen the language as the amendment requires. Indeed, there might be a danger that there would be hardly any section 9 excursions, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>865</span>
perfectly routine holiday tours, for example, would be subjected to the whole traffic commissioner procedure, with unnecessary expenditure and time-wasting, and no advantage to the road service network.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say much about the amendment because I wish to speak for a rather longer time on the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary with a great deal of interest, and on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends on this side of the Committee I wish to welcome the tone of his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He seemed to be seized of our fears that established licensed services could be damaged in certain circumstances. The amendment seeks to substitute the words "in any way" for the word "directly". I support the amendment as I believe there is less ambiguity in the words "in any way" than in the word "directly" because under certain circumstances one could mount a complicated argument as to what competes directly and what competes indirectly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the aims of the amendment is to strengthen the safeguards to protect local stage carriage services. But I am convinced that the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates that argument as we saw from the trend of his remarks and he may care to reflect that our amendment strengthens the wording and adds to clarity. In certain circumstances it could be argued—I am sure that lawyers would so argue in any circumstances—how one would interpret the words "directly" and "indirectly". Lawyers could mount a whole expensive brief and a refresher on those two words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of debates such as this is to listen to each other. I have listened to the Parliamentary Secretary who just assured me that there could be more ambiguity in the words "in any way" in certain circumstances that could render parts of the clause inoperable, and I tend to be convinced by what he said on the argument of the balance of advantage. However, I still believe that he could seriously consider the amendment. It may not have the effect that he stated, but it was certainly not our intention that the amendment should give rise to circumstances where one could stop a local excursion because one or two passengers were attracted to it. We did not
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
want it to drop down to that point of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) is to reply next and I shall listen to him with great interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I make clear to all members of the Committee that it was not our intention when tabling the amendment to try to put lawyers out of work—far from it. I believe that the additional clarity that the amendment brings to the clause, whilst certainly being an advantage, was not our major purpose, We are trying to deal with a real and practical problem that will come before the commissioners, but in answering on that I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary has stretched our concept of what is probable too far. I cannot accept in the normal meaning of the English language that a very large proportion of tours and excursions will inevitably conflict at some point along their routes directly with stage carriages. I would accept the proposition that a large number of tours and stage carriages will coincide at some point along the routes they follow, but that is an entirely different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be held that there is competition merely by virtue of the fact that over part of a route there is a coincidence of a stage carriage and a tour or excursion. Therefore, I believe that in many cases the coincidence will not be the matter that the commissioner will have to take into account. What he will have to take into account—presumably that would occur with either form of wording but I agree that that would probably occur in more cases with the amendment—is whether what is proposed as a tour or excursion has on its route stops which coincide with other stops on a service that is covered by a road service licence, and, if it has, what the conditions are for carriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not what is considered by most passengers to be a tour or excursion, however. They apply for a seat on a tour or excursion and normally expect to be carried along a particular route from one place to another and back, stopping not for the purpose of picking up passengers, in the main, but to call at a pub or cafe or see some beauty spot. That is what the majority of people consider a tour or excursion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It adds considerable point to our amendment if we say that that kind of tour
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>867</span>
or excursion will not cause the commissioners difficulty. Obviously it should be the kind of tour or excursion for which the Minister suggested, very helpfully, a shortcut procedure. The difficulties for the commissioner will arise under a different kind of service proposed under the heading of tour or excursion. It would be the kind of service that travels to specific places on specific days within the radius prescribed in the Bill for express services. In this case, there is a similar limitation on a requirement for licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone may propose to run an excursion on days when a certain team is playing at home from one village or town to the place where the team was playing. That person may regard that trip as an excursion. In such case, the commissioner must consider whether that is competing "directly" or "in any way", according to whether the amendment is accepted. If he considers it on the basis of competing "directly" then he can look at similar services and turn it down on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the shrewd operator who has followed our proceedings with great care—for which he has our sympathies—will realise that what we have done here is make an overlapping provision between the definitions of express services and tours or excursions. He will realise that there is one way to avoid the need to go to the traffic commissioner, and another to ensure that if he does, the commissioner will use the short-cut rather than use the full section 5 procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former will occur in many cases where the distance of the route from end to end begins to approach 30 miles. Let us take the example of a tour or excursion to a football match, jazz concert or special event. I am not trying to distinguish between the services provided. I accept that people attending any of these events are equally entitled to be provided with bus services. The operator in those cases will know that all he has to do to get outside the licensing provision altogether is to have a point somewhere on the route that is 30 miles from the point at which it starts or at which it finishes. That is one option open to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other option is so to arrange his stopping places that they are slightly different from the stage carriage services operating in the area. He can then tell the commissioners. that it does not compete directly because it is slightly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
Commissioners are practical men, but they have a great respect for the decisions of the House of Commons. If we say "directly", they will have to assume that we mean directly. Therefore, any different service may not be held to be competing directly. If we say "in any way", the commissioners will use their judgment, knowing that we mean a way which has a detrimental bearing on the provision of public transport in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in terms of the practical tests that the commissioners will apply on receiving applications for licences under this procedure, we believe that it is better to leave them this scope rather than putting in an unreasonable restriction by saying that the route must compete "directly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the strength of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument. Indeed, to shorten our proceedings, perhaps I may make part of his argument as well as my own by saying that that argument is strengthened because there is no appeal against refusal of an application under this clause. We understand that the commissioners' decision is final. However, if the commissioners say that it competes in some direct way and therefore do not issue a road service licence under clause 9, that does not mean that the applicant has failed in his application. It merely means that, without any further action on his part the application will go forward to be considered under section 9 of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I believe that the balance of advantage lies with the wider definition. That would enable the commissioners to exercise a judgment on what we are agreed is the narrow area of whether the application was suitable for the short-cut procedure or whether it should be considered under the full procedure. I believe that commissioners can do that very effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with the spirit of part of the Parliamentary Secretary's approach. He tells us that commissioners have a primary duty to protect stage carriages. Of course they have. But it comes ill from him or his right hon. Friend to tell us that, when they themselves are proposing legislation which cuts down the ability of the commissioners to carry out the primary duty to protect passenger services. It is the Government who are cutting back that line of defence. We may have quite sincere differences as to whether the public passenger transport service interest is best served by having commissioners, but we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>869</span>
should not be arguing that aspect of their role in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government, we believe that if there is to be a short-cut procedure it must be subject to rather special tests. What we are arguing about is the width of the test on the first leg. We believe that a more practical approach, which will be better understood by the commissioners, the public and the operators, is that under the alternative second test of the clause there should be the wider definition that we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to an amendment which is in a sense designed to protect the national heritage. The Committee will appreciate that amendments Nos. 113 and 114 are essentially paving amendments. The essence of what I have to propose is contained in amendment No. 115.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Virtually everyone in the Committee has at some time travelled on a tramcar in Blackpool, so often the site of Conservative and Labour Party conferences. I believe that that tramway service is now unique in this country. Personally I regard that as a matter for some regret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>

	<p>bearing on the service with which it competes. I do not think that there is any point in exchanging examples of where football excursions may or may not run in exchange for stage carriage services. The purpose of the amendment is greatly to increase the number of excursions and tours that have to go through the full procedure. We believe that to be unnecessary, and that the commissioners will not use the short-cut procedure in any but the most obvious cases. The present wording of the Bill covers that quite adequately. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 9.</p>

	<p>Three factors affect my support for the amendments. I have just mentioned the first—that these trams are extremely useful during party conferences, particularly if one is on the outskirts of Blackpool. That is not unusual when one is not a Minister or when no one is paying for one's accommodation. My enthusiasm for the amendment is a little reduced by the fact that the cheap entertainments of Blackpool were some years ago seduced away from Worthing. I regard that as having been a retrograde step. I can think of no reason for their going from Worthing to Blackpool other than the fact that Blackpool is bigger.</p>

	<p>The third factor is a sentimental one. During the war I was evacuated with my school from Dulwich to a school called Rossall, near Fleetwood. That is at the other end of the Blackpool line. Interesting events took place on many occasions. I well remember my Latin master recounting that when he got onto the tram he asked for a return. The conductress asked, "Where to?" He replied, "Back here, of course". On another occasion, in a sort of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" speech, he said that his decision had been greatly influ-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>871</span>
enced by the fact that the girls on the Blackpool trams had stopped calling him "love" and started calling him "dad". He was unnerved, and knew that it was time to retire.</p>

	<p>The essence of the amendment is simple. If I have understood the clause correctly—my hon. Friend may find it necessary to correct me on this—it means that if application were made for a local excursion service that would compete with a tramway service, that local excursion would automatically get a licence with no questions asked. On the other hand, if a local excursion were trying to operate on a local bus route, there would be much more detailed consideration of the whole procedure. Trams and buses are not being put on the same basis, although, as we know, they may well be competing with each other.</p>

	<p>I do not suggest for one moment that the amendment will make a major improvement to the environment, or that the Bill will be vastly improved by it. But unless I am mistaken, the drafting has gone a little adrift. The Government have not taken fully into account the circumstances in the area that I have mentioned. I urge support for the three amendments.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would unreservedly support the amendment if it had the effect that the hon. Gentleman claims for it. It is totally worthy. But I wish to explore whether it may have a much wider effect than he believes. That is not necessarily a reason for opposing the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can probably claim to be one of the few members of the Committee who has driven a tram. That was not at Blackpool but at Crich in Derbyshire. When I went to do that, and one or two other duties which fell to me under a previous role, I discovered what enormous interest there is in tramcars. This country must be almost unique in the EEC in having devoted so little time and resources to improving, sustaining or introducing tramcar services. In view of the oil crisis and the general shortage of fossil fuels now looming up the great flexibility in fuel supply of an electric motor tram is an advantage. If the Bill is the success that the Minister anticipates, a number of other tram services may well operate within its lifetime. Therefore the consideration that the Minister should give the matter, and the reply that he makes to the Committee,
	<span class='label label-info column'>872</span>
should not be concerned only with whether someone applying for a tour or excursion in Blackpool is competing with Blackpool trams. He should also take into account the possible wider application of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not comment on whether the drafting is perfect; the aim is very clear. It is that trams should have exactly the same protection as buses with stage carriage licences against short cut procedures which might disadvantage them. The aim of the amendments is 100 per cent. laudable and I support it. But it would be useful to hear whether the Minister thinks that given the wider application it is sufficient merely to deal with the matter in this way. Modern tram services may be developed in a number of towns. It is far from unlikely that we shall be subject to EEC regulations covering trams—the EEC commissioners and possibly EEC Parliaments will be looking at transport. We in this country shall have to decide whether trams should remain under a separate branch of the law or whether they should be seen as analogous to other forms of road transport. We all understand the distinctions and differences caused by the limitations of tracks. But that is not relevant to the point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and his hon. Friends have done a signal service by tabling the amendment. They have enabled us, first, to consider the immediate and narrow issue that flows from it and, second, to consider the serious wider issue that is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should begin by putting on record my fondness for trams, too. I have travelled on them frequently in this country and abroad and I have also visited the tramway museum at Crich. It is within my memory that they ran in quite a number of large cities in this country such as Birmingham, Sheffield, London and Sunderland. I can remember there having been trams in the not too distant past. But it is correct that now they are confined to Blackpool and whenever I visit the party conference in Blackpool as I do biannually I always travel on a tram. I have not yet had the good fortune of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport of actually being allowed to drive one, as he did when we attended the party conference last summer. I am sure that that would be something with which we could all be trusted since, as I under-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
stand it, the prospects of getting lost on the way are somewhat less if one is driving a tram than if one is driving most other forms of vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, as the trams are confined to Blackpool it would be Blackpool that would be most affected by the amendment. The right hon. Gentleman invited me to go wider and asked what would happen if tramways came into wider use in this country. I agree with him that we certainly should not reject the possibilities of any sort of electrically powered vehicle coming back into greater use in this country, and no one has shut out the possibility of the revival of tramways or trolleybuses of one sort or another in our public transport. I should have thought that there was little prospect of putting tracked vehicles back on the highway in this country. If tramways were to be restored I believe that they would have to be on a separate track so as to avoid traffic congestion, which was always a problem when they were on the main streets of cities such as Sheffield. But if they were to be brought back, they would be governed by the Tramways Act 1870 and we should have to look at where that legislation needed updating. I anticipate that they would require separate legislation because the construction of a new tramway is rather akin to the construction of a light railway. Statutory powers would tend to be needed, including the power to attach wires and cables to buildings and so on for which special powers are better provided by different legislation from that covering buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present trams are not public service vehicles in the definition of the Bill, therefore they do not come within its scope and are not mentioned. But my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) tabled the amendment and I know that Blackpool corporation attaches great importance to it. The effect of the amendment would be that when someone applied for an excursion or tour and the traffic commissioner was considering the short section 9 procedure for giving a road service licence, the commissioner would not issue such a licence unless he was satisfied that the proposed excursion did not compete directly with a tramway. My first reaction was that Blackpool's fears that it might be adversely affected by excursions or tours competing with its tramway were somewhat fanciful. But Blackpool obviously knows its position better than anybody else and is more
	<span class='label label-info column'>874</span>
familiar with the local network of services. Fortunately, Blackpool has retained a spectacular length of tramways and it is a considerable journey from Blackpool to Fleetwood. I suppose it is conceivable that someone might start applying for regular licences to run excursions back and forth between Fleetwood and Blackpool that competed directly in every way with the tramcar service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being a danger and trams being an equivalent form of road transport to buses I can see the probable need for the amendment. As the amendment has obvious wide support, as my right hon. Friend has impressed upon us, the Government will be happy to accept it and have all three amendments written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Parliamentary Secretary's list of cities that operated trams. He omitted to mention Glasgow which I believe was the last city to operate trams with the exception of Blackpool. The last tram ran in Glasgow in September 1962. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), I have had the privilege of driving a tram, although somewhat unofficially. For two years I was a tram conductor in Glasgow, and we used to take the odd short run in the depot, although we were not supposed to. It was great fun. At that time, the trams—or "caurs", as they are called in Glasgow—were held in great affection by the travelling public. Indeed, they still are, and many sections of the public would be delighted if a tramcar system were to return in many parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly support the amendment, so that if tramcar services ever return they will receive the same protection as certain bus services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that on the whole the clause is very sensible. As has been explained by the Parliamentary Secretary in a number of speeches, it aims to outline special provisions for the granting of road service licences for certain local excursions and tours. It is my view, and, I think, the view of the Opposition, that broadly, within the framework of the wording of the clause, its main aim is achieved. I think that most members of the Committee will agree that it has managed to strike a fair balance between tight wording and flexibility, which I believe should be the aim of most clauses in any Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must express one or two reservations about parts of the clause, because some unhappiness will still exist about the fall of amendment No. 109, which sought to delete subsection 1(
	<i>b</i>) relating to special events. It has been directly conveyed to me that there is still unease in some quarters. The substitution of the words "special events" for the words "special occasions" used in previous legislation has caused suspicion among some operators that traffic could be extracted from local bus services which provide good and reasonable alternative facilities. It has been put to me that under the clause as it now stands a vehicle could slip in without a licence if certain people were unscrupulous enough to try to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether it will work out like that in practice, I do not know. I merely say at this stage that the suspicion and unease in some quarters of the transport world have not been laid to rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening at this early stage in my hon. Friend's remarks. However, he will appreciate that we do not have the advantage of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of that part of our last sitting when we considered something highly relevant to the point that he is making about special occasions and events. I should like him to amplify his concern, to the extent of showing us whether he is dealing precisely with the point that gave rise to the amendment and whether on reflection he feels—as I do—that following those discussions we need a better definition in the Bill. That would overcome the many legal difficulties that have arisen in
	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
present legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point from my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). I hope to cover that matter during my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary in the dying half hour of our previous sitting—when I felt as though I were dying, too—but I do not recollect the precise argument that he deployed. I know that he expressed concern about what we were saying, but as I do not have the 
	<i>Official Report,</i> I do not know whether our fears were laid to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to me that the whole matter could have been dealt with in clause 5 when the public interest could have been fully considered in that framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have read the two clauses aright, there is a distinction between excursions over 30 miles and those under that distance. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us why it has been felt necessary to try to make a safeguard straddle two clauses—clause 9 and clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good deal of discussion has revolved around the words "event" and "occasion". That was part and parcel of our amendment which fell, and about which my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness has just expressed his fears. I am advised that there has been considerable legal ambiguity over the cases that have been argued in court about the words "special occasion". Confusion has arisen from the precedents that have come down. One might put the matter in a different way. One might say: "We all knew where we were until the lawyers got at it." Indeed, we do not know where we are, because one case seems to conflict with another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to get right to the heart of my right hon. Friend's case. It has been argued in court that, first, a special occasion must be particular and individual. Second, it must be special to the place concerned—the scene of the special occasion, so to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the matter, regular excursion journeys are not special occasions in some respects—for example, to the Blackpool illuminations or fishing trips. However, in other circumstances they are. A regular excursion to see Ipswich Town play at Portman Road would be a special occasion—and when one goes to see Ipswich Town play football, it is a very special occasion;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>877</span>
indeed, a unique occasion. The courts would argue that a trip to see Ipswich Town in an FA Cup round would be a special occasion, and the courts would be absolutely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I extrapolate the reasoning and continue the argument? When Ipswich Town wins the Cup at Wembley this year, all the buses that pour out of East Anglia will come under these regulations. Our Committee will not be sitting then, but after Ipswich have won, I shall be pleased to receive written congratulations through the Letter Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue that argument further, otherwise other members of the Committee will be tempted to explore the respective merits of their own local teams.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, Mr. Dean, but I know that other members of the Committee realise the strength of what I am saying, so I do not expect any interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point. It could be argued that with the new interpretation placed on the word "events," the word could be used in a way that would allow certain things to slip through. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will reassure us on that matter in order to dispel the unease that exists in this respect. Will he explain why there is no right of appeal in subsection (3)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensible clause. Its aims are clear-cut. I welcome them, given the reservations that I have just expressed. I was most encouraged to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary said. He appeared to be very much alive to the dangers of local excursions and what they could offer. He set a sympathetic tone. I hope that when he replies to the debate on the clause he will underline what he said previously and give us more assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), I think that there is a sound case for having a clause which provides a facility for a short-cut or streamlined procedure to deal with applications for road service licences for what we know as tour or excursions or even—to use the words in the Bill—services which would enable passengers "to attend special events". So we are not arguing about the principle of
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
having such a clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me is the way in which the procedure is defined here, and the way in which it is virtually strangled at birth for a range of services which I contend are undoubtedly laid on for special events. I shall not take the example of local football teams, and I do not claim to be an authority on the merits of particular football teams, but I understand from those who claim to understand their merits that the definition used here is a difficult one. The fact that two teams play each other does not in itself make the event special. For example, Newcastle playing against Arsenal may not be considered by the commissioners to be particularly special. By some fans it may not be considered special. But if the teams were playing each other in the final of the FA Cup, it would undoubtedly be special. But under the meaning of the clause, that would not determine whether the streamline procedure could be used by someone who was proposing to lay on a service to take passengers to see the event. It would be controlled by the definition of express carriage. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, that overrides other considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the fans who live more than 30 miles away from the ground, this procedure is totally irrelevant. For fans within 30 miles, it may or may not be relevant according to the proposed route. The merits of the clause are much circumscribed by the previous decision that the Government have proposed and the Committee has accepted, but because of that, we must regard the clause in that way. We cannot examine the merits of the clause as if that decision had not been taken. The whole clause has been circumscribed by an artificial express service licence definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has not followed through his point about appeal. While it is correct to say that subsection (3) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"No appeal shall lie under section 27 from a decision of the traffic commissioners",</p></blockquote>
that is very different from saying that there could be no appeal. I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether a court action could be brought—as I believe it could—on the grounds that the commissioners had not carried out a duty laid upon them by Parliament under the clause to grant a road service licence in this way.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>879</span>
The clause has a precise and direct meaning that gives rise to the possibility of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is conceivable that an operator could argue that he had applied for a service that "would not compete directly" and would not duplicate exactly another service with an existing licence. He could, on those grounds, say that the commissioners should have considered his application instead of turning it down and putting it through the full clause 5 procedure. There would be a temptation to appeal, for if the operator could establish a precedent by winning a case it would be open to him to try for a whole series of other services that he believed were excursions or tours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important point regarding the wording. We must consider the clause in the light of the wording
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the proposed service would not compete directly".</p></blockquote>
We must consider it within the constrictions of the effect of the express carriage definition and we must consider the sort of nonsense that could arise. I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary could, other than tongue in cheek, defend the limits within which the clause would operate. I do not think that he really believes it right that if someone very slightly bends the route of his excursion or tour, he should be able to operate it outwith these limits. All he has to do is take a slightly artificial route and there will be no need to apply under this or any procedure for a road service licence. That is the nonsense we have as a result of procedure decisions, and it is the nonsensical framework within which we are now obliged to consider the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the term "excursions, tours or special events". Surely it would be easy for an unscrupulous operator to move in on outings, especially in rural areas and coastal resorts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, not only will rural areas suffer urban areas will also be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow, for instance, there are huge perimeter housing estates such as Drumchapel, Pollock, Easterhouse and Castle-milk, some of which have populations of over 40,000. They are the same size as the city of Perth, but without the amenities of any decent town or city. These are dormitory areas where people sleep, but they have to travel to work or play. There are no
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
cinemas or dance halls and until fairly recently there were no public houses. There is little industry or employment and transport is a major need for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow we have one of the best displays of Christmas lights of any city centre. These lights used to be on for only a couple of weeks over the Christmas period. In recent years they seem to be on from early November until well into January, and, who knows, in the near future they might be in operation from September to March. Added to that, there is the undoubtedly special event of Santa Claus being installed in every major departmental store in the city, again for ever-lengthening periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who could dispute that a trip to see Santa Claus or the Christmas lights in city centre stores is other than a special event or are we to say that Christmas and Santa Claus are not special? In Glasgow, in particular, excursions or tours would be run to see the lights or Santa Claus. Excursions, tours or special events could coincide by accident with peak travel periods, especially from those large housing estates. There would be substantial demands to travel on the special event services, which would operate for much of the year. No doubt in summer, when the lights and Santa Claus are not available, there are suitable alternatives, and the services could continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many private operators would be able to move in to the business, some operating a one-man, one-coach business without complex back-up facilities. They would therefore be free from many of the overheads of regular transport operators, and would be able to charge substantially reduced fares and attract passengers away from the regular services. Many of those one-man, one-coach operators use the public highway as their garage and do whatever maintenance is required on the public thoroughfare. I believe that that is greatly against the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how clause 9 will protect the public interest. Subsection (2) will be left wide open to abuse, and the clause should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that there is widespread agreement that there is scope for streamlining granting road service licences to what I might call ordinary excursions and tours. No one can see a case for retaining an elaborate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
machinery for excursions and tours, and the clause deals with the second half, as it were, of the way that the Government intend to simplify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first half is that part of the clause that ensures that any excursion or tour that takes passengers more than 30 miles from their starting point is free from licensing altogether. We are in dispute about that, which was covered by an earlier part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 9, the Government accept that there is a case to make sure that, where the distance a passenger is carried is less than 30 miles, there must be protection to ensure that excursions and tours do not compete directly with stage carriage services. Without clause 9, it is conceivable that rather dubious excursions and tours could aim to compete with the stage carriage service, without going through the full application procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 9, where an ordinary application for a road service licence is made—and an application must be made if the excursion or tour is carrying passengers for a distance less than 30 miles—the commissioners are under a duty to grant a licence if they are satisfied, and only if they are satisfied—that is, that it has gone beyond a dubious case—that one or other of the criteria has been met. If they are satisfied, it means that they have decided that it is plainly an excursion or tour that would do no damage to their other licensed services. They therefore must issue a licence. That licence would have no conditions attached to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is doubt in the commissioners' minds—and that is all it needs—on either of the grounds set out in the Bill, the application must be treated in the full and proper way set out in clause 5. That is what follows when an application is not dealt with under clause 9, and there is therefore no need to have an appeal procedure for clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of a road service licence being refused but of the commissioners not being satisfied that the necessary criteria have been met. They would therefore not feel obliged to issue a short-cut clause 9 licence, and it would involve a full hearing under the provisions of clause 5. It is an unnecessary further step to have a specific right of appeal, at the first point, against the fact that the commissioners have declared themselves not to be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
It is conceivable that an applicant could believe that his service was so clearly an excursion or tour within the terms of clause 9 that it would be quite wrong for the traffic commissioners not to be satisfied. I can conceive of circumstances in which a writ would be issued to try to require the traffic commissioners to follow the clause 9 procedure. It could give rise to litigation. However, such cases would be few and far between. Presumably an applicant would consider it worth litigation only if he was so distressed by the opinion of a particular traffic commissioner that he wanted to obtain the court's guidance on that commissioner's interpretation of clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, a disappointed applicant would merely go ahead with an ordinary application and await the outcome of clause 5 procedures. If in the end he is refused, he has the remedy of appeal to the Minister. I believe that that is the course that will, in practice, be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Parliamentary Secretary allow that, when an applicant was disappointed or aggrieved, he could be considerably financially disadvantaged? His commercial interests could be affected by the refusal of the commissioners to consider his application under this procedure. Therefore, one should have an indication of the time it would take the commissioners to use the normal procedure. If a commissioner chose to consider the case under clause 5, how long would it take?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an operator saw an opportunity to run an excursion or tour as a result of an event that was to occur at relatively short notice, and was frustrated by not being able to use the short-cut procedure and therefore prevented from running the service, his grievance would be based on the subsequent effect on his commercial undertaking. His reasons for pursuing the case could go much further than the immediate effect of being unable to run the tour. He might be able to establish a precedent in the courts which would ensure that, if a similar circumstance arose in the future, he could operate through the procedure laid down in clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is conceivable that such circumstances could arise. If an applicant were refused a clause 9 quick licence, going through the full procedure laid down in clause 5, which could take up to two months, would very much depend on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
whether there were any objections. If it were dealt with under clause 5, and no local authority or operator objected to the excursion or tour, clause 5 would not cause any great delays. But if it were a highly controversial application, two months is a modest assessment of how long the clause 5 procedure might take. Clearly, that might jeopardise the tour, and if it happened over and over again to a tour and excursion operator he would want to establish a precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no quick and easy appeal procedure to cover a particular tour or excursion. Naturally, any appeal procedure, either to the courts or to the Minister, takes time, and probably would not rescue any particular excursion or tour which had been refused clause 9 procedure. But if, in practice, an excursion or tour operator were suffering damage, I have conceded that it would be possible to litigate. The wording of the clause would enable that litigation to be sorted out sensibly, and would not pose any difficulty to the courts in interpreting the words that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the … service would not compete directly"</p></blockquote>
or the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"special events".</p></blockquote>
Of course, it is not possible to provide an appeal on the facts of the particular application. When traffic commissioners have to be satisfied, it is up to them to look at the facts of an application and use their own judgment as to whether it satisfies the criteria. So we are dealing with a traffic commissioner who, in the opinion of a tour operator, is adopting a fanciful interpretation of these words, and the operator decides to go to the courts on the basis that one of his applications was so obvious that no reasonable traffic commissioner could have concluded that it did not satisfy the terms of clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So such litigation is possible, but if such a case arose I should be very surprised. I believe that in the ordinary course of events, this procedure will become quite routine. Indeed, I am advised that if a tour or excursion operator has an existing licence, it is likely that he will be able to add to it by notifying the traffic commissioner by telephone of a particular additional excursion that he wants to run. Any traffic commissioner who is familiar with the area, familiar with the operator
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
and the stage carriage services, would tend to give clear clause 9 cases sanction in a comparatively informal way. That is how we see the system working, and I do not see that it will give rise to much litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our last debate we dealt with the first limb of clause 9 applications. Opposition Members are still concerned about the special events limb of clause 9, which we debated in the small hours of Wednesday morning. Great concern—even suspicion—has been expressed about changing the word "occasions" to "events" and precisely what meaning could be attributed to "events".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had I wanted to filibuster on my own Bill, there were plenty of opportunities for me to do so. I was encouraged to indulge in my affection for tramcars. I am a fanatical follower of football. If I wanted to do so, I could dwell on the one or two occasions a year when I see Ipswich Town on its travels. But here we are getting into a fanciful world, where people imagine that complicated judgments will have to be made about what is a special event and what is a special occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, my reaction to the choice of the words "event" or "occasion" is that I cannot see that it makes a ha'porth of difference which is chosen. If there is a difference, the Government's choice in the Bill, "events", is narrower than "occasions". "Events" implies some kind of happening; "occasion" is a somewhat wider word. But in practice I do not think it will make the slightest difference to the traffic commissioner's judgment which word we put in, nor do I think that he will be tempted, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston said, to believe that every excursion to the Glasgow shopping centre is a special event or occasion as long as one of the large stores has a Santa Claus or gnomes' grotto available for the children during the Christmas period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that the commissioners will be able to put the ordinary meaning on those words. They will decide that a particular football match, race meeting and concert satisfy the conditions in suitable cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman, and no doubt some of those who have approached him, are concerned because of the considerable amount of case law that arises out of earlier legislation on special events. I suppose the fear is that lawyers will get their hands on this and persuade the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>885</span>
traffic commissioners to come up with odd interpretations of "special events".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from me to argue about this, but I can see no circumstances in which the lawyers can get their hands on this. It will not, except in the very extreme case that I have mentioned, go to litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authorities which the right hon. Gentleman has cited go back to the old schedule 12 cases. There could quite easily be litigation, because people could be prosecuted for operating without a licence. They then raise this defence and there are arguments about whether something which happened once a week could properly be regarded as "special", and soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we must trust the common sense of the commissioners, who will not be open to complicated legal argument. They will just be considering a road service licence and making a preliminary judgment as to whether they are satisfied that it is a special event, and whether they should issue a quick licence without bothering the applicant with the section 5 procedure. In practice, that will not lead to serious difficulty, nor lead us back to those curious precedents which exist under the old section 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the point about section 12 in the case history, and we would have to accept that as part of a comprehensive control system. That is embodied in the Bill. It works itself out eventually after case law and lawyers tend to accept it, except in trade union cases where they sometimes differentiate. But is it not likely that if the commissioner were to refuse a licence on certain grounds, there would be a contest in the courts because the operator had been refused a licence and might then want to invoke clause 1 as a kind of new schedule 12 and quote clause 1(1)(
	<i>c</i>) which says—and we had a heck of a fight to ensure that this was not taken out—
	<br><blockquote><p>"making it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not continue to speculate about the very unlikely cases which could arise, which might again take us to where clause 1 has to be invoked in order to resolve some ambiguity in the terms of the remainder of the Bill. I cannot see that happening in this limited area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 9 is part of the process of making it easier to apply for road service licences.
	<span class='label label-info column'>886</span>
It makes it easier to apply for the ordinary excursion or tour licence which is doing no one any harm, is not damaging any other service, and which ought not to have to go through the whole rigmarole of applying for road service licences. That must remain our main aim. It is why the clause is so worded, and we would not be adding anything for bus operators or anyone else if we went to great lengths to try to cover, in even more narrow language, the unlikely problems and instances that still trouble the Opposition. I therefore invite the Committee to accept clause 9 as part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we shall resolve our differences here. We must make up our minds whether it is better, despite all the serious deficiencies we have identified, to have the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put two further points to the Parliamentary Secretary. He is not justified in suggesting that the only time when there might be litigation on the matters is if a commissioner has fanciful ideas. I do not share that view. Litigation would come if the applicant for a road service licence took a strict view of the wording, and felt that it meant he was entitled to use the procedure for a service which would not compete directly with another. Commissioners are not fanciful people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an attitude about which we shall have to argue. I do not want to speak off the cuff at length on the subject of possible litigation. However, it would not be enough for the applicant to say, "I disagree with the commissioner's opinion. The commissioner may decide that he is not satisfied and the applicant might well say to himself "Well, he should have been satisfied." However, the applicant can litigate only if he is prepared to argue that no reasonable traffic commissioner, on the facts of his application, could conceivably have rejected it in the light of the wording of the clause. That rejection would have to be of a very unusual nature for such a case to be contemplated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's first point but I disagree profoundly with the second. Surely it must lie within the competence of a court, on an application by a frustrated applicant for a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>887</span>
licence, to consider the argument that the clause requires the commissioner to behave not just reasonably. After all, any legislation assumes that people will carry out their duties in a reasonable way. That is not the point of difference, which is about the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner is required to refuse an application only if he is satisfied that the service competes directly with another. I suppose that the argument which would have to be advanced in court is what is a reasonable interpretation of the word "directly". One such interpretation might be not to provide an exact duplicate service. However, another applicant's reasonable interpretation of what directly affects another road service could go much wider than that. That is why I am by no means satisfied that this part of the clause is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are far from satisfied that swapping "event" for "occasion" will solve a problem that has previously arisen in another context from the use of those terms Although I learn something all the time in this Committee, I was surprised to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that words do not make a ha'porth of difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"there has been a contravention of any condition attached to it".</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting amendment, designed solely to secure a consistency of wording throughout the Bill. Elsewhere in the Bill, when referring to any breach of condition</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>

	<p>That is a selective, horses-for-courses sort of proposition, because the Minister frequently has to argue—indeed, he may even have to do it on the next Government amendment—that a slight difference of wording will make a tremendous difference.</p>

	<p>It seems to me that whether something is an "occasion" or an "event"—I shall stay with the world of football, as that is the example which has been chosen—would be very much open to the commissioner to decide. He may, in common with the Parliamentary Secretary, have an appreciation of football and say that Celtic playing Rangers would certainly be an event, whereas another commissioner might take the view "It's just another football match." He could be even more ignorant of the game than I am.</p>

	<p>I do not believe that the problem has by any means been dealt with. We are under great difficulty in voting on the clause over the two important weaknesses that lie in it.</p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 6.</p>

	<p>the word "contravention" is used. As originally drafted, clause 10(1) uses the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any condition attached to it has not been complied with".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Clearly, it is preferable to use the word "contravention" consistently throughout the Bill. It occurs in clauses 4 and 21.</p>

	<p>The definition clause, clause 35, makes clear that a contravention includes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a failure to comply with the condition or provision".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>So the meaning of the Bill is not being altered in any way. It is merely a drafting change to make sure that we use the same word throughout.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, this clause follows on from the granting of licences and the conditions attached, as outlined in clause 9. There are some points that we should like to make in the clause stand part debate. It is noticeable that there has been no Opposition amendment to the clause, which follows from the principles contained in clause 9 and elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause appears simply to spell out the powers that are available to the commissioner if he wishes to revoke or suspend a licence given to the operator of a service under clause 9 in respect of the conditions relating to excursions or tours not competing with other services or special events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A characteristic of that clause is that a licence will be given automatically provided certain criteria are met. There are no grounds for the commissioner to quibble about the conditions affecting the licence. He must take into account the purpose of the service and, provided that it complies with the conditions in the Bill, a licence will be given. The area of doubt is what may constitute a special event, or what may be considered as competition with another service which has been given a road service licence. I may be wrong, but I am just trying to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman realises that clause 10 has a general application to all road service licences. It does not necessarily follow from clause 9, but deals mainly with the position when someone is in breach of the conditions attached to a road service licence, which can then be revoked. The clause goes much wider, and refers to every sort of road service licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for being most helpful. I would not like any granting of licences if there had been a breach along those lines. I believe that follows the general application of section 135 of the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause clearly reflects the philosophy of the Bill and it remains a point of contention between the two sides of the Committee. I noted that the Parliamentary
	<span class='label label-info column'>890</span>
Secretary welcomed the fact that there had been some welcoming remarks from our side of the Committee for relaxing some of the conditions for granting licences for tour and excursion operations, but those remarks have to be taken into account with our general philosophy, which is significantly different from the Government's. We are prepared to accept that the commissioner and the use of case law as such is an appropriate way to deal with the granting of licences and the development of an integrated transport system. The Government, obviously, are approaching matters from the opposite end of the spectrum—that is, that the presumption should be that there should be a competing transport system with controls reduced so as best to achieve that end. The clause clearly reflects that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government also recognise that there will be some circumstances where controls will be necessary, but the matter of definition, namely, whether a special event is a football match, a visit to Santa Claus or whatever else was talked about, will apparently be left in the main to the judgment of the operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The commissioner, yes, but is the operator bound to make the application? I thought that I had read in notes given to us that in some cases that was to be left to the judgment of the operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The applicant makes an application for a road service licence, and he only obtains it by the quick route of clause 9 if the commissioner is satisfied that it is a proper clause 9 case. Therefore, it is the commissioner's judgment that is the determining factor in whether or not one avoids the full procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comment makes clear that it is for the commissioner to determine whether his judgment is in line with the intention of the Bill. From my reading of the notes I believed that, as it was difficult to define what was a special event, that matter was to be left to the judgment of the operator, but I now see that to mean his judgment on whether he makes application for a licence if he could not operate a service without that licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>891</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has to apply for a licence if he is taking his passengers not more than 30 miles from their starting point, and that is the only decision the operator has to make. If his excursion or tour is going less than 30 miles, the operator must apply for a licence and it is for the commissioner to decide whether he will deal with that application under clause 9 or clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had rather misinterpreted some of the advice given, but what the Parliamentary Secretary has said makes matters much tighter than I had assumed them to be. Nevertheless, it has been useful to the Committee to debate the balance of judgment exercised by the operator making the application or by the commissioner—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene, but I suggest to my hon. Friend that his point has not been understood by the Parliamentary Secretary. It must surely be the case that an operator can indicate when applying for a licence that he wants it for what he considers to be a special event. If he does that, he is clearly indicating to the commissioner that he expects him to consider his application under clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it had been made clear that that would be the position. However, the Parliamentary Secretary will have the chance to explain matters if they need clearing up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Balance of judgment must have been involved when the Government decided on the conditions set out in the Bill. A good example was given to the Committee when the matter of the Blackpool trams was paraded before it, but I wonder whether that example is unique. It is unique in the sense that Blackpool has the only trams currently operating in this country, but is it right that there should be no competition in that case on a fare stage route where excursions could adequately serve the same purpose? Presumably, such competition would be in contravention of the conditions for the provision of a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretary accepted that amendment moved by the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). We wonder whether such judgments are presently exercised in these circumstances by the commissioners, and we would have been happy to leave matters there. Clearly, there is uncertainty in all changes and there is some difference
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
between the two sides of the Committee as to what may be the practice compared to the theory. That is inevitable with fundamental change. I would be the last to argue that one should do nothing because change would bring uncertainty. However, I disagree, with the fundamental changes in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Parliamentary Secretary give his observations on some of the changes brought about by the clause? I shall not reiterate what was said about special events or competition in service or licence areas, but I should like to hear his views on cases where there has been a breach of the licence conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is made in the notes on clauses that the criteria set down here are very similar to those in the 1960 Act. Subsection (2) makes clear that revocation or suspension would not occur with a simple isolated incident. There would have to be a degree of frequency. The same wording is used in the 1960 Act, but I do not know what "frequency" means. I see that in that respect the advice given relates to whether the weather is bad or spare parts are not available. Presumably, such considerations will apply when an operator does not carry out his obligations under the conditions stipulated when he applied to run the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does "frequency" mean? Can the operator breach the conditions 10 times, five times or once? That point may be too detailed for the Parliamentary Secretary to answer but I am curious to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) refers to a breach of conditions having been committed "intentionally". In the 1960 Act the word used is "wilfully". My first reflection was that "intentionally" made it easier to establish proof. "Wilfully" is a word I associate much more with merchant shipping legislation and matters of discipline and I have a strong reaction to it. It seems to imply that one does something with a certain amount of aggression or malice. That is not the case with "intentionally". I would welcome the word if it made it easier to prove why a breach had occurred. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell the Committee why the Government decided to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would use of the word "intentionally" mean that a worker had failed to carry out his obligations to an employer? For
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>893</span>
example, we discussed whether conditions laid down for the granting of licences meant that one was not supposed to pick up passengers between point A and point B. The understanding of the arrangements was that it may be sufficient to prove that a breach of conditions was not the fault of the operator but of the man who drove the bus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, a worker's error would normally be the responsibility of his employer. What is the position in regard to these licence conditions? If they were breached by the driver, could he absolve himself of the responsibility? Will that be taken into account when the commissioners consider whether an operator is in breach of the licence conditions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area is the danger to the public. I think that everyone would agree that, if there were any danger, it would be sufficient to breach the conditions. As the Parliamentary Secretary has made clear, the clause applies to all licences, so I do not have to be concerned about the limited restrictions of clause 9. If a coach were involved in an incident and it was found that its brakes had been faulty—as has happened on a number of occasions—would that incident alone be sufficient for a licence to be revoked, or would it have to happen frequently, so that the coach could go off the road five times, due to faulty brakes, before the licence was revoked? Frequency of such incidents must be seen as part of the danger to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would speeding be considered a reason to revoke a licence? What about having drink on board a football excursion? Parliament is now considering fining the operator and possibly also the driver of a bus on which drink is allowed. Would the presence of drink be considered a danger to the public and a reason for revoking a licence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as the Government are considering a totting-up system for traffic offences, would incidental traffic offences—each in itself not sufficient to cause the revoking of a licence—be cumulative and result in the temporary suspension of the licence or its revocation? Those are small points arising out of clause 10(2) on which we should be grateful for the Parliamentary Secretary's observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see no serious grounds for opposition to the clause but there are matters of detail that the Opposition must
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
probe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the powers of the traffic commissioners to revoke or suspend licences purely on the conditions attached to licences. There is now a hierarchy of penalties for different circumstances and we can go up through the triangle. I shall want to question the Parliamentary Secretary on that in a moment because I should like clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intentions of the clause are stated quite directly While there are clear-cut powers to visit penalties on offenders there is also flexibility to issue warnings and give operators time to put matters right. I always think that that is a good thing. It is rather severe to bring the sword of Damocles down straight away without giving someone time to mend his ways. It is a good thing that there is provision in the clause for warnings, and that the traffic commissioners have discretion to see whether their warnings and advice have been heeded. That kind of approach is always best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, anyone who breaches the licensing conditions as laid down in the Bill could be visited with penalties in the following ways. Under clause 4(6) the holder of a licence can be fined up to £200 on summary conviction. In the context of penalties clause 10 should be seen in conjunction with clause 4(6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that in the framework of penalties under clause 10 an operator who breaches the conditions attached to his licence can face revocation or suspension of that licence. The malefactor can also be given a dressing-down, a formal warning to mend his ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also penalties for operating without a licence. We are concerned with the distinction between a breach of licensing proper and a breach of the conditions of a licence. Those two offences have to be separated in our own minds. My first question is what precisely is meant by revocation? I should like a full definition of that. Does
	<br><blockquote><p>"a road service licence may be revoked".</p></blockquote>
mean that the licence is taken away absolutely? If an operator does something wrong does he have a licence one minute and have it taken away the next? I assume that that is the meaning of the word "revoked" in subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is "Yes".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the operator comes to reapply—or rather, make a separate application for a licence in the future—will the fact that a previous licence has been revoked for a misdemeanour mean that it will be more difficult for him to get a licence on another occasion? Is his record taken down and used in evidence against him the second time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to question the Parliamentary Secretary on a point of detail. If he cannot give me the answer now perhaps he will let me know later. I have noticed that criminal justice legislation relating to Scotland has been introduced in another place. I did not listen to the debate, but I understand that the Bill will affect the carrying of drink on coaches. There will be new penalties for that, especially with regard to excursions to football matches. If I may express a personal opinion, it is about time, too. My main question is do the traffic commissioners now have the power, and are they likely to have the power in future, to say that one of the conditions of a licence is that drink cannot be taken on board for football match excursions. There is an easy answer to that question: "Yes" or "No". I hope that traffic commissioners, being wise and omnipotent in these matters, will take this serious aspect into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point that I want to put to the Parliamentary Secretary. The thoughts of traffic commissioners are sometimes quite beyond my comprehension and often beyond the comprehension of a number of individuals I have met over the years. Will there be any correlation of penalties so that there can be some regularity between one area of traffic commissioners and another? If so, what machinery is there for seeing that decisions in one area are consistent with decisions in another? If a person can be a scallywag in the North-East, is it possible for him to transfer his operations to East Anglia and still remain a scallywag, getting away with it in East Anglia but not getting away with it in the North-East? That is to put the matter simply. What arrangements are there so that, unlike in magistrates' courts up and down the country, there is some consistency between decisions that are made? When decisions differ greatly, it causes great concern to many people who look for regularity in these matters. For instance, when an operator has committed a certain offence, presumably reference will be made
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
to what has happened elsewhere to estimate the seriousness of that offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would explain to me the hierarchy of penalties in the total context of the Bill. Will he bring together the scattered bits and pieces so that the operator can see what he is up against and what his obligations are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has rehearsed all the arguments, and I do not want to repeat them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, when the Bill was drafted, very little was drawn from the 1960 Act except for one part of subsection (2). The 1960 Act said—
	<br><blockquote><p>"owing to the frequency of the breach of conditions on the part of the licensee".</p></blockquote>
I note that the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the part of the licensee".</p></blockquote>
have been taken out of this Bill. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will say that the reason for that is that it is possible for a person to apply for a road service licence and not necessarily operate the service himself. Taking out those words is an improvement, but I want to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point I want to raise on the drafting of the clause, with which the Committee does not have much quarrel, is that I should have thought that between 1960 and today there was some case law concerning "frequency". Subsection (1) contains the words "may be", implying that the traffic commissioners may or may not, yet in subsection (2), as in The 1960 Act, there is a definite order—"shall not". If the traffic commissioners "shall not", there must be something to go on in determining what "frequency" means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where we really get into trouble is on the intentional aspect. It seems not unreasonable to suppose that, given the difficulty of proving intent, the traffic commissioners may not apply this provision as rigidly as they would with a tighter definition.

that subsection we see fit to have notice sent
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>

	<li>"to the chief officer of police of every police district in which the service to which the licence relates was provided; and</li>

	<li>to each of the councils".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
in the appropriate areas. In order to avoid the problem of a person who has had his licence revoked or suspended simply applying in another area, it would seem reasonable to inform other traffic commissioners as well. Otherwise, a traffic commissioner in one area having exercised the powers that the Minister has rightly given him under clause 10, the intention of the clause may be frustrated by the same operator applying to a traffic commissioner in another area. That point, which was rightly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich, does not seem to be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are going to the trouble, quite rightly, of advising the chief officer of police and the local council, perhaps the Minister would apply his mind to the question of what is to prevent a person whose licence has been revoked under clause 10 from then going, not necessarily from the North-East to Ipswich, but to a traffic commissioner in an adjoining area or some other traffic commissioner, and applying for a licence. If one goes so far as to inform the police, why has not the Minister included in subsection (3) some indication that if a person has his licence revoked or suspended other traffic commissioners should be advised of the fact, so that that is taken into account if that operator seeks to apply in another area? I should be grateful if the Minister, in replying to the debate, will concentrate on the important matter of what is excluded in relation to the 1960 licensing provisions, and in particular to the area of doubt to which I have just referred, namely, that when a licence has been revoked or suspended, unless something is put into subsection (3), there is nothing to prevent that wayward Johnny from moving next door and applying to the traffic commissioner there. Apart from that, I think that there is broad agreement on the clause throughout the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is satisfactory indeed that there is broad agreement on the clause, which gives force to the provisions that we have previously passed whereby conditions may be attached to road service licences. I should make it
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
clear that we have now gone back to the mainstream of road service licences, not just excursions and tours. We have to broaden our horizons beyond Santa Claus and Glasgow, or Ipswich Town or any other football club. This goes back to the mainstream of road service licensing. Indeed, clause 9 licences for excursions and tours cannot have conditions attached to them, so the clause has no reference to excursions and tours of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here dealing with the broad mainstream of road service licences for stage carriage and so on. The Committee will recollect that in clauses 6 and 7 we dealt with the kind of conditions involved. The traffic commissioners have a wide power to attach conditions. Clause 6 refers to suitable routes, copies of timetables and fare tables being carried, points at which passengers may be taken up and set down, the kind of conditions which may be applied to a stage carriage licence and, as a reserve power, conditions of fares as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee has approved—and all sides are agreed on this—that where a licence is granted it must be right for the commissioners to have a discretion to attach such conditions, we have to consider what penalties are to be invoked if the conditions are breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not dwell on it, because it arises out of the earlier clauses about what conditions might extend to. Without giving a binding opinion, I should think that in the end it might have to be determined by a court. It seems, however, that the discretion of the commissioners to attach conditions extends to specifying that no drink shall be carried on a service, and I agree that might be a sensible condition for football match excursions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier clauses, we dealt with the condition-attaching power and the Committee is giving wide discretion to the commissioners in the Bill. What happens if the conditions are breached? What should the penalties be? Obviously it is necessary that they should be enforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first, and perhaps most usual penalty, is that a prosecution could arise under clause 4(9) for running an unlicensed service—unlicensed in the sense that it does not comply with the terms of the licence. That would be the ordinary sanction. It would be appropriate because it could give rise to fines, and therefore the likelihood that the operator and his employees would revert to operating the service in accordance with the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>899</span>
It is conceivable that there could be a maverick operator who is either so irresponsible or so negligent in the control of his business that the conditions are being breached in a flagrant way, and his service run in such a way that it does not match the service that the commissioners intend to licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 provides that the traffic commissioners have the power, therefore, to revoke or suspend when breaches of the conditions are particularly bad. This is a drastic power. The effect either of suspending or revoking the licence is to stop the service, so it would only be proper for the commissioners to contemplate it if there is a maverick operator. Otherwise, the penalty will bear on the operator, who will more or less be put out of business by having one of his routes closed down, and the passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very much a reserve power. It appeared in section 136 of the 1960 Act. It was necessary there, and it is necessary here, so that there is real back-up power to enforce these conditions. I am not aware of any occasion when it has been used. It would, indeed, be a drastic power, used to its full extent of revocation of a licence. But, clearly, if the condition-making power is to have meaning and some effect on operators it is as well to retain it so that if the conditions are flagrantly abused, in the last resort the licence could be taken away from the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, more limited steps that can be taken, such as suspension and warning. A warning given to an operator by the traffic commissioner so that an operator knows that the commissioner has up his sleeve this very drastic power if his warnings are not heeded is, in practice, likely to be the most effective way of achieving the desired aim. But all that is contemplated in clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other matter likely to arise is that of the precise circumstances in which this power can be invoked. Subsection (2) sets out the three alternative conditions—they may occur in combination—when the commissioners can have, and contemplate the use of, this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is frequency of the breach of conditions. There is no case law saying that six times gives power to revoke whereas five times does not. It is a matter of judgment for the commissioners because they are given wide discretion over when
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
to exercise the power. The word "frequency" is included to make clear, as hon. Members said, that one incident—when a mistake is made and the route is not followed, or an isolated occasion when the operator discovers that something has been done and immediately takes steps to prevent it from happening again—should not give rise to use of the power. The commissioners would obviously use their common sense in deciding whether the frequency was such that either a warning or a suspension were justified, or, if it happened so often, with conditions being habitually broken each day of the week, whether the second revocation should be contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Intentionally" is a change of wording from "wilfully". I am advised that it imports no change of meaning, it is merely a more modern word. "Wilfully" is slightly outmoded language, "intentionally" means exactly the same. It does not have any sinister implications. It is to cover an accidental breach such as a driver getting lost and not following the route prescribed as a condition of the licence, and so on. The breach has to be intentional for the provision to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the dangers to the public that may be involved in a breach. I refer to dangers that arise out of noncompliance with conditions attached to the road service licence—such as brake failure from bad maintenance—and all that bears on operators' licences, PSV licences, vehicle inspections, and so on. But some of the conditions attached by the commissioners to the service licence have a public safety factor. To give an example, if the condition covering picking up and setting down places were being ignored and passengers were being picked up and set down at dangerous road junctions or at traffic lights, that would involve, among other things, possible danger to the public. It would justify the commissioner using his fairly drastic powers under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the best of my knowledge, revocation has never been used. The warning or threat of suspension or revocation should be enough for any operator in his right mind to persuade him to put his service in order and make sure that it complies with the conditions of his licence. But the power remains and it is one that the commissioners should still have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we ensure that there is national consistency about this provision? I shall not go into the area of the magistracy in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>901</span>
which there are attempts to get consistency in decisions and penalties. All the commissioners will have the same powers under clause 10. There are only, I believe, 11 commissioners. They meet fairly frequently. They obviously consider matters of this kind and I am not aware of any serious differences, or of one commissioner getting way out of line. As it appears that no commissioner has yet found it necessary to use his power to revoke, it seems that they are being consistent. But having this draconian power gives them authority over the operators. In practice, they can use it sensibly. It is necessary to make sure that the conditions that we agree should be attached to certain licences are complied with. The operator will know that he will lose his licence if he flagrantly defies them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene again, but I asked the Minister to explain the significance of leaving out the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the part of the licensee",</p></blockquote>
which appeared in the 1960 Act and which do not appear in the Bill. I asked the fundamental question whether it is possible to have a road service licence and get someone else to operate the service. Is that the reason for leaving out those words, or is there some other reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only the licence holder can operate the service for which he has a licence. We discussed earlier whether he would need an operator's licence when he applied for a service licence, but he can apply for it before getting his operator's licence. A licence holder cannot be granted a licence and then leave the operation of his service to someone else. He may have servants or agents running the buses or managing his company, but he is the licence holder and he is operating the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1960 Act did include the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the part of the licensee",</p></blockquote>
but it is difficult to see what meaning they add. We are concerned with conditions attached to a road service licence. The question to be asked is whether the service is being run in compliance with those conditions, or whether the conditions are being breached. Whether the conditions are breached by the licensee or by his drivers on his behalf, is immaterial. The licence holder is the man finally responsible—I say "man", but it would probably be a company. It would be up to that licence holder to take steps to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
sure that the conditions were complied with. It seems superfluous to indicate that in the case of frequent breaches they must be made by the licence holder himself. In the case of a company that would make no difference, but in that of an individual some rather silly results might be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The liability plainly rests with the licence holder to make sure that the conditions are complied with, and any breaches are matters for which he is responsible. Clearly, any licence holder will take steps, once he has received a warning from the commissioner, to remedy those breaches of conditions, so as to avoid the risk of suspension or revocation of his licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a technical amendment to correct an unintentional omission from the Bill. Subsection (4) is based on the assumption that a road service licence can be limited only
	<br><blockquote><p>"to one or more particular periods or occasions"</p></blockquote>
by commissioners attaching conditions. Leaving aside any conditions, the licence can be granted for a limited service.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
That was apparent from our debate on clause 9 in respect of the circumstances when no conditions are attached. However, a licence granted under clause 9 could be for a service operating only to take people to special events. The amendment makes sure that the concept of a licence which is limited to a specific period or occasion is brought into the clause, which ensures that none of the provisions in the clause interferes with the commissioners' powers to grant licences which operate only on particular days or times of the year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned in this clause with the periods for which road service licences are granted and the way in which other parts of the Bill affect the validity of the system proposed for controlling those periods. The biggest, most direct and most noticeable change that the clause makes to existing law is to alter the normal maximum period for a road service licence from three to five years. We shall listen with interest to what the Parliamentary Secretary says in justification of that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked through the records of licences granted by traffic commissioners in recent years. There is nothing in those to convince me that there is a general case for an extension. It seems that traffic commissioners regularly consider licence applications in the light of changing conditions in the operation of services, sometimes brought about by the corporate decisions of bus companies and sometimes by local authorities under the duties and powers laid upon them by the House of Commons to provide passenger transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is not static or rigid. With all the considerations that apply, I cannot see that there is a prima facie case, in the light of commissioners' current experience, for saying that as a general rule road service licences should be granted for longer periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is repeated within the context of the longer period of the road service licence envisaged by the clause a provision that has existed in our law for some considerable time which enables commissioners for special reasons to specify a
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
period for the licence that can be less than five years—one year, two years, or three years—and with that change there is certainly scope for a wider range of periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That clearly is an important power in the hands of the commissioners. It is important from the point of view of operators, in any case. So far as I have been able to see, nothing in the Bill indicates what special reasons are envisaged as being applicable now, as opposed to in the past, or applicable in the wider range of periods now open to the traffic commissioners. Therefore, I ask the Minister to advise the Committee on the sort of special reasons which he believes would now apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, "special reasons" has such a wide meaning as to be almost unchallengeable by litigation or legal action. Presumably, a reason is special if the traffic commissioners consider that it is special.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the normal commonsense approach to that, and on the sort of advice that we have had up to now when approaching the issue, it seems that the commissioners would be likely to continue to limit the period of licences if they had some doubts about the operator's ability to run the service effectively on the route. Here we get into the new area raised by the Bill because, clearly, the commissioners operating under this legislation—if the Bill becomes an Act—will not have the freedom they previously had in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change of criteria means that the commissioner, where he considers other things equal, is now enjoined by the Government to grant in favour of the applicant. Of course, it is very hard for him to know whether other things will be equal without knowing how the operator will perform upon the route. Therefore, it seems to be well within the compass of the meaning of "special reasons" for the commissioner to take the view that he wanted and, because the operator was new to him or had an unknown performance record—I shall not say "track record" which might be a pointed slip—to give him a short-term licence and then review matters on a further application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a considerable difficulty is raised by this legislation for a commissioner who wants to operate that system because it does not exist under present legislation. Therefore, why, when the Government were framing this legislation, presumably knowing that they wanted the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
commissioners to have the power to vary the period of the licences, did they provide that the applicant for the road service licence need not be an operator?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Bill the commissioner may well be considering an application for a road service licence from somebody who is not an operator or does not have an operator's licence. In those circumstances it is virtually impossible for the commissioner to form a valid view as to whether, if he grants that licence, the applicant will operate in a way that is in the public interest and meet all the other conditions that the commissioner may have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that before the road service licence can take effect, before the service can run, the applicant for a road service licence has to obtain an operator's licence. But as I read the Bill, it does not follow from that that he has to obtain the operator's licence from the traffic commissioners in the area in which he has applied for the road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised that issue during discussion on a previous clause—admittedly in a different context. Later, unfortunately not at the time of the debate, I learnt that some people were of the opinion that the justification for framing the Bill in this way was that an operator may wish to get his operator's licence in another part of the country where he is running a business involving public service vehicles. That is understandable. But it creates a real difficulty for the traffic commissioners. The House will want traffic commissioners to be able to form a worthwhile objective judgment on the ability of applicants for operator's licences to operate in the public interest on the route for which the licence is granted. The Bill may have robbed the traffic commissioners of that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take an extreme example, such as can legitimately be used to test a law. Under the Bill, unless more qualifications or limitations are added, a commissioner for
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
Land's End can be required to decide on an application for a road service licence in the Land's End area by someone from John o'Groats. The applicant can then obtain an operator's licence in John o'Groats. He will not then be required to use the road service licence in the Land's End area. Under the Bill he can approach another operator with his road service licence for Land's End, and come to a contractual arrangement enabling the second man to operate under the licence. That is one of the changes brought about by the Bill. I do not even say that it is intentional. But unless we do something about it the traffic commissioner will find it very difficult to protect the public interest as we should wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The repeal by the Bill of the present legal provision for six-month licences is singularly ill timed if not ill judged. The Government are proposing to change the criteria for commissioners. At the very time when the commissioners are more likely to want to issue a six-month licence and see how an operator performs, their ability to do so is being taken away. That flies in the face of experience and of whatever logic will be left in the system if the Bill goes through in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision, although it appears in section 139 of the 1960 Act, was put there by the 1978 Act. We do not have much experience of short-term licences to guide us. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what experience of the operation of six-month licences has led him to the conclusion that the power to issue them should be withdrawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
