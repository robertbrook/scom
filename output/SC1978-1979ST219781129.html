	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT ANCILLARY DENTAL WORKERS (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 1979</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State far Health and Social Services (Mr. Eric Deakins)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Ancillary Dental Workers (Amendment) Regulations 1979.</p></blockquote>
The regulations, as drafted by the General Dental Council, have been approved by the Privy Council under section 41(9) of the Dentists Act 1957 and, on behalf of the Privy Council, I commend them to the Committee. They amend the Ancillary Dental Workers Regulations 1968—as amended in 1974 and in July 1978. The current regulations provide for the setting up of rolls of ancillary dental workers. They also specify the kinds of work that dental hygienists and dental auxiliaries may undertake—scaling, polishing, applying prophylactic materials, giving oral hygiene advice, and, in the case of auxiliaries, extracting deciduous teeth and doing simple fillings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal in the draft Regulations is simply to change to dental therapist the name of those ancillary workers who are at present known as dental auxiliaries. However, as a consequence, minor changes in references to titles, certificates and the nominal roll are needed and these are also made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United Kingdom, the name dental auxiliary was chosen in 1956 to describe the ancillary dental worker who, under the direction of a qualified dentist, treats patients in the limited ways I have mentioned. However, elsewhere in the world the term dental auxiliary has a wider meaning, embracing also those classes of workers who provide services to the dentist, as opposed to treatment to the patient. Skilled dental operatives similar to our dental auxiliaries are generally known outside the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
United Kingdom as dental therapists or school dental nurses. The different meanings attached to the title dental auxiliary lead to confusion and the change to dental therapist is supported by the ancillary dental workers committee of the General Dental Council and by dental auxiliaries generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment regulations, which have no implications for public funds, are due to come into operation on 1st July 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.33 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee for more than two minutes. My hon. Friends and I welcome this change which brings the United Kingdom into line with international practice. Because the dental auxiliaries have a valuable role to play in preventive medicine and in improving dental education and thus the health of the teeth of this country, it seems that their function is entirely worthwhile and praiseworthy. We also know that both the professional bodies involved appear to favour this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to raise two small queries with the Minister. They have been put to me and I think that he will be able to answer them quite quickly and allay some fears within the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the word "therapist" has perhaps led to some concern because of the comparison with physiotherapists and occupational therapists, who are different from a dental therapist—or what will be called a dental therapist—in that they are able to undertake paramedical independent treatment away from a doctor. In other words, a physiotherapist can operate a course of treatment without a doctor being present or involved at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the use of the word "therapist" could pressage a similar trend in the change of status for dental auxiliaries. That has also concerned dentists practising in this country and I should like the Minister to confirm that there is no intention of changing the present status of auxiliaries when they are called therapists and that they will continue to have to operate under the direct control of a dentist and not be able to operate in a paradental sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect, which arises out of that, is that there seem to be two main trends in the development of the auxiliary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
profession in the rest of the world. There are some auxiliaries, originally from New Zealand and called New Zealand dental nurses, who, in that country, and indeed, in Third World countries, are operating entirely independent of dentists and many miles removed from them. There is also an auxiliary pattern, which we have developed in this country, which is always operated under the control of a qualified dentist. The second concern that has been expressed to me relates to the future pattern of development and which of the two routes we shall be following.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no reason to suppose that we shall break away from past development, that is the subordinate status and operating nature of the auxiliary, but it is a concern that has been expressed amongst members of the profession and it would be helpful if the Minister could allay those fears by confirming that no change is intended. With those two minor provisos, we welcome the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Deakins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can deal briefly with the two queries raised by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) and I think that I can reassure him on both matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1968 regulations permit dental auxiliaries to work only under the direction of a dentist, that is after the dentist has examined the patient and indicated the treatment to be provided. The dental auxiliaries do not act on their own. The supervision concept is strongly supported by the dental profession as a dentist must be on hand to deal with emergencies. There is no intention of changing that procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some in the profession who would like to see auxiliaries—we are now calling them therapists—employed in general practice. However, there are, in any
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
case, insufficient numbers trained to do this work and the initiative for any change in function must come from the profession itself. That is the safeguard that the hon. Gentleman is seeking. Obviously, we would consider any proposals on which there was a consensus, but it would be up to the General Dental Council to draft amending regulations and put them to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lewis Carter-Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to be involved in the realm of the paramedical profession, there are difficulties in terms of therapists in the sense that the occupational therapist, the physiotherapist and the remedial gymnast is allowed to operate on his or her own. May we have a firm assurance that dental therapists will not be allowed to operate in this way unless regulations are presented to the House for approval?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Deakins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones) and the Committee that assurance. There is no question of my hon. Friend's fears being realised. I have tried to indicate the pattern in which any change would come. First, it would have to come through the General Dental Council and have its backing, which would be a very difficult hurdle to surmount. Secondly, following a recommendation from the General Dental Council, the whole process would have to come back to both Houses in the form of draft regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
