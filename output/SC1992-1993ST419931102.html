<br><br><!-- lb --> Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 1679)</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Income Support (General) Amendment No. 3 Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 1679).</p></blockquote>
It is not my intention to delay the Committee unduly this morning but I think that it is important to raise a couple of matters relating to the regulations. I am pleased that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments noted what I had already seen: that the regulations were defectively drafted. I am pleased that that Committee intends to amend them on those grounds. When I considered the regulations, I thought that they were defective in a broader sense of the word but I am prepared to accept that they can be drafted correctly at a future date and that we can proceed today. I am glad that that defect was spotted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to discuss two matters relating to the regulations: first, the issue surrounding the restrictions on income support on mortgage tax relief; and, secondly, the issue of urgent cases payments and the consequent reduction in entitlement for persons from abroad—I think that they are popularly termed PFAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order in which I have listed my points may not be correct in terms of how they appear in the regulations, but it is how I have arranged them, so I shall deal with them accordingly. On the issue of income support for mortgage tax relief, there has been an enormous amount of publicity surrounding notorious cases where people were being maintained by large income support payments, in what were considered to be inappropriately large residential properties. In many ways, there was a certain merit in the Government reconsidering such cases, because there was public concern about the amount of money being paid out. The Government put out for consultation changes to the regulations to tackle the problem. As we often find when the Government try to change regulations, they tend to take a sledgehammer to crack a nut and bring into the net people who, in other circumstances, would not be considered to be inappropriately receiving income support payments to ensure that they kept a roof over their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the regulations were put out for consultation, there was considerable concern about how the proposals would actually impact. Organisations such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Child Poverty Action Group expressed particular concern about how the regulations would operate in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Social Security Advisory Committee did not oppose setting a ceiling in any circumstances, but expressed concern about the proposals and made certain recommendations based on evidence submitted by groups involved in dealing with the consequences of changing the income support regulations. Those groups strongly
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
believed that the new ceiling for income support was far too low. The figure of £150,000 for the current year, which will be reduced to £125,000 next year with continual reviews thereafter, seems unreasonable to many people. Although the impetus of the proposal was to check millionaires living in millionaires' mansions, who receive vast amounts of income support to sustain their lifestyle, it is erroneous to suggest that £150,000 in any way sustains people in such properties. Although the value of the property market in London has fallen considerably, the south-east is still an expensive area in which to live and £150,000 buys a reasonably modest property. Because of the fall in house prices in the south-east, people with a mortgage on a property of £150,000 are often in negative equity. Although we all hope that the Government will change their economic policies, which will strengthen the economy generally and sustain house prices, there is currently little optimism on that front. Organisations, such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, have stressed that people living in modest properties with negative equity are not the people at whom the proposals were aimed, but they will be brought into the net of restricted support for mortgage interest payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Child Poverty Action Group has clearly shown, regulations already exist to allow the Government to place restrictions on payments for housing costs. Under schedule 3 of the social security regulations, interest on a loan can be restricted where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the home is larger than is required by the claimant and her/his family in comparison with suitable alternative accommodation."</p></blockquote>
There was public outcry over the types of properties that were being supported because they were inappropropriate for the needs of the families living in them, but existing regulations deal with that problem. Secondly, the interest can be restricted where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the immediate area in which the home is located is more expensive than other areas in which there is suitable alternative accommodation."</p></blockquote>
That restriction could, however, be brought into effect without any change to the regulations. Thirdly, interest can be restricted where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the housing costs are higher than those for suitable alternative accommodation (e.g. because of the size of the loan)."</p></blockquote>
Existing regulations deal with that possibility without the need for wide-ranging changes, which may hit families whom the Government did not intend to hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Social Security Advisory Committee reported on the changes to the regulations, it made certain recommendations to the Government. First, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposals should be deferred until the Government gained assurance from the insurance industry that mortgage protection insurance would be made available to existing borrowers"</p></blockquote>
Secondly, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the assurance could not be given, the new regulations should apply only to loans taken out after they come into force."</p></blockquote>
Thirdly, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the ceiling should not apply during the first 16 weeks of a claim when only 50 per cent. of eligible interest is met by Income Support."</p></blockquote>
Fourthly, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"plans to reduce the ceiling to £125,000 from April 1994 should be deferred until the position has been monitored."</p></blockquote>
The Government's own advisory committee raised five crucial points about the implementation of the regulations. Unfortunately, only one of those recommendations, which concerned the limit on the loans when homes had been adapted for disabled people, was accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Will the Minister explain why the Government ignored not only the evidence that was submitted to the advisory committee by many expert organisations, but the advisory committee's report, which clearly outlined the major worries that existed about the matter? Why do the Government consider that they must introduce extra measures, when it is clear that existing regulations can deal with the problem? Why do they believe that the ceilings that are being applied reflect accurately the housing costs and the housing market? What will be the impact of the regulations, especially on lone parents and self-employed people given that the recession means that they are finding things a great struggle? They may lose their jobs and they certainly do not want to lose their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about modest homes in the south-east and the south of England that do not provide excessively over-generous accommodation. Families at least deserve to remain in their homes. There is no merit in people becoming homeless on the back of the regulations if such measures are inappropriately pitched in terms of the capital value of the property that they cover. Will the Minister give us an assurance about the regulations and explain, first, why they are required and, secondly, how they have been drawn up and what targets they are designed to meet?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to explore the changes to regulation 70 of the Income Support Regulations and the consequent reduced entitlements to income support for persons from abroad. The changes are contained in regulation 2 of the Income Support (General) Amendment No. 3 Regulations. As we know, persons from abroad are entitled only to income support paid on an urgent case rate and in limited circumstances. The new amendements would restrict those circumstances even further. We have heard a great deal of rhetoric from the Government about restricting benefit payments to people from abroad, but we are dealing this morning with specific and narrow circumstances on which the changes will impact. We would welcome an explanation of those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider two crucial changes. Persons from abroad who seek to vary their leave will not qualify for urgent case payments. Before August, urgent case payments could be made to those seeking leave, provided that the leave was not subject to the requirement that they should have recourse to public funds—in other words, permanent leave. Public funds are defined in the immigration rules as income support, family credit and housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Persons from abroad who seek asylum status are now specifically mentioned as being entitled to urgent case payments. They were entitled to that before the amendment was introduced, so the position of that group remains unchanged under the regulations. Will the Minister clarify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will lose out from the variation of leave? Until the changes in August, foreign spouses were able to claim urgent case payments when applying for permanent leave. They are admitted initially to the United Kingdom for 12 months, subject to the requirement that they do not have recourse to public funds. Income support rules state specifically that foreign spouses are not entitled to income support or urgent case payments during that period. They would normally apply to the Home Office for permanent leave to remain just before the expiry of the 12 months, but we know from our constituency immigration cases and appeals against decisions by the Home Office that it is often
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
many months before a final decision is made on whether someone is allowed permanent leave to remain in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in dire financial circumstances, spouses from abroad will be unable to claim urgent case payments for themselves, their partners or their children, although they would have been able to do so under the previous system. The only option will be for a member of the family of the couple who is already settled in this country to make a claim on behalf of the family, but benefit will be granted only for the claimant and not for the whole family. If a couple's children enter with a spouse from abroad, no income support will be paid for the chidldren. They will be forced to live on an income level well below the Government's definition of the poverty line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The family unity of people who legitimately obtain temporary leave to remain in the country before seeking permanent leave will be means-tested, and while the Government are considering that application there will be no entitlement to benefit. Only a few cases and small sums of money are involved. We are not talking about vast amounts of benefit, so why do the Government believe that it is appropriate to put a restriction on such people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must question the Government further on asylum-seekers. Not all who seek refuge in the United Kingdom are willing to apply for asylum status because they know that they may jeopardise their status once they are able to return to their country of origin. They may, however, apply to stay on compassionate grounds and may ultimately be awarded exceptional leave to remain. They have, however, no right to claim urgent case payments while awaiting a decision, by the Home Office, which again may take some time. The Opposition believe that people who are here as genuine refugees and who are ultimately granted extended leave to remain on exceptional or compassionate grounds should be entitled to urgent case payments, which are equivalent to a reduced level of income support. They should be entitled to some financial support while their cases are being considered by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain why foreign spouses and asylum-seekers are being excluded from the regulations. I shall not say any more unti I have heard the Minister's reply, when I may want to question him further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Burt)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the background to the regulations, which I urge my colleagues to support. I am also grateful, as always, for the clear and patient way in which the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) put his case. I am sure that I shall be able to satisfy the Committee that the amendments to the regulations are well judged and answer the hon. Gentleman's questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the regulations in the same order as the hon. Gentleman and, therefore, I shall first discuss the matter of mortgage interest. The hon. Gentleman was right to refer to the publicity surrounding some cases and to suggest that there was merit in the Government acting to deal with them. He also said that we have existing restrictions to deal with some of the problems. We have retained those restrictions, but, of course, it was patently obvious from the cases that arose that the restrictions could not always do the job. We provided the opportunity for the restrictions to be deferred for up to a year. It was during
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
that period that the Government were most open to criticism from the Opposition, as well as from others, who said that the situation was not good enough and that we must do more. In response to the general opinion of the taxpayer—that it was inequitable to provide income support payments to those with substantial mortgages—the Government acted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a problem as to what extent existing limits should change. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we had moved into more modest territory. It is a matter of degree and of understanding fully what the restrictions do and do not do. There is no suggestion that no support should be given to those who have a mortgage of £150,000, which drops in the following year to £125,000. The regulations will, however, prevent support from being applied over and above that level. I should have thought that the vast majority of taxpayers, who do not live in such properties, would believe if fair that their tax, which is used to provide for other people through income support, should go to support extensive mortgages—£150,000 and £125,000 are not small sums—and that, by that, they would be fulfilling their commitment as citizens. Over and above those amounts, however, the aim of the proposal is that house owners should be prepared to provide for themselves to cover the circumstances in which they might otherwise have had to seek income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What percentage of families with a mortgage in south-east England live in properties worth below or above £150,000, and, from April 1994, how many will live in properties worth below or above £125,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure is about 1 per cent. I suspect that that is a little imprecise for the hon. Gentleman and I shall take steps to provide a clearer answer. He will appreciate that the figures and the size of properties involved are relevant only to a small group of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make the major point clear. We are not talking about a total absence of support, nor are we talking about a circumstance that would lead to homelessness, as described by the hon. Gentleman. The Government are entitled to be concerned, on behalf of the taxpayers, about who should bear particular responsibilities—whether a responsibility is the duty of the individual or the state. As always, we maintain the principle that in circumstances of dire emergency, the state has a role to play—none of us, as taxpayers, would think that wrong. When considering the total social security budget, however, the Government are entitled to ask where the British people believe responsibility should lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the matter of mortgage interest, we believe strongly that home owners, especially those in receipt of higher incomes and those who have bought properties at a higher price, can take steps to cover a situation which would otherwise have led to a request for support from the taxpayer. That principle is implicit in the regulations. We believe firmly that a market will arise to provide house insurance above the levels of support where income support would normally have been applied and thus the individual will be covered. We believe strongly that the individual should bear that responsibility. I have difficulty with the argument from the hon. Member for Withington, that that principle should not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I have many low-income taxpayers in my constituency, as does the hon. Gentleman, and I think that if they fulfil a commitment to pay income support to people with mortgages up to £150,000, many of them would consider that limit too high, rather than too low. Therefore, our move has been well thought through and is one which we are entitled to rely on in relation to merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following carefully what the Minister says and do not necessarily disagree with him, but I am slightly puzzled. I may be wrong but I always thought that previous to regulation 3 being introduced, the Department had the right to restrict the amount of interest available. What puzzles me is what has gone wrong with the mechanism so that we have to make this change. Am I right that the power existed formerly and, if so, why has it not been properly used in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been used properly in the past. The question is the speed of the impact of the restriction. It was always possible to restrict the amount allowed for mortgage interest on income support if, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said, it was excessive to the amount that the customer needed to obtain suitable alternative accommodation. However, the restriction could be deferred for up to a year if the customer was able to afford the load at the time it was taken out and it might not apply at all if it was not deemed reasonable to expect the customer to move. It was precisely those circumstances which led to the big cases reported in the newspapers where people said that it was outrageous to give support even for that period of time. It was precisely on those grounds that we were under criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What kind of difference will this make in terms of savings? If we are only considering deferring for a 12-month period, we must be talking about relative bawbees for the social security budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always impressed by how free and relaxed Opposition Members are with other people's money. We are talking about an overall saving of £6 million to the taxpayer, which we consider to be a quite reasonable sum. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has plenty of ways of using that sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is this: the opportunity that we have taken to change the regulations ensures that we provide help and support up to a certain amount; we believe that it is unfair for the taxpayer to pay beyond that amount. We believe that the supplement will strengthen the existing restrictions and, therefore, help to assure people that they are being fair to those who find themselves in difficulties, but that responsibility is rightly being placed at an early and pre-announced stage on those who ought to be able to make provision for their own circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the recent National Audit Office report that the Benefits Agency had lost or overspent about £700 million, Mr. Bichard said that one of the problems was that there are more than a thousand mortgage lenders. Surely it is somewhat unfair of the Government to lay all the blame on borrowers when the lenders create terrible complexities for paying mortgage interest rates. How much does it actually cost the taxpayer, if that is the issue with which we are concerned, to keep a family which has become homeless?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that question takes the debate a little wider. The suggestion is not that the borrowers should bear all the criticism. The argument is whether it is right for the taxpayer to have a commitment to those who are able, by their own efforts, to purchase reasonably sized properties and who have an income to match; or whether it is right that those people should take out some insurance to cover circumstances which would otherwise place them on the back of the taxpayer. That is the issue which we are discussing. I do not think that a commitment from my constituents—and, I suspect that they would have to support more people in such a situation in the hon. Lady's constituency of Hampstead and Highgate than in mine because of the larger size of houses and the different property prices—to pay mortgage interest support up to a limit of £150,000 and £125,000 is a bad commitment. I think that I am protecting my constituents by suggesting that over and above that there is a responsibility on the home owner. That is the purpose of the regulations and that is why we are right to apply them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member --> 
	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I have spent a lot of time on that issue and would like to move on. The hon. Gentleman raised a point about the Social Security Advisory Committee and I am happy to deal with that. He was right to say that it made five recommendations. We accept the one relating to disabled people. The Committee recommended that our other proposals should be deferred until there had been further discussions. We believe that the insurance available takes little account of the help available to owner-occupiers in receipt of income support. We are discussing this with the lending and insurance industries. However, we do not think it appropriate to defer introducing the changes. More than 500,000 claimants receive help with mortgage interest. We estimate that less than 2,000 new claimants will be affected by the introduction of the limit of £150,000. The figure of 1 per cent. that I quoted earlier is a national figure. I do not know how it breaks down regionally, but I shall try to find out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly confused by the hon. Gentleman's answer that only 1 per cent. of people with mortgages in the south-east lived in properties worth more than £150,000. I am surprised at that because I understand that a two-bedroomed terrace house in parts of London costs more than £150,000. I would be grateful for some clarification of those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in response to a previous question, the Minister said that it was the responsibility of the borrower to consider financial arrangements to protect his mortgage, which I accept. The Social Security Advisory Committee recommended that, until there is certainty about the insurance protection offered to existing mortgage holders, they should not be brought into the net of the new regulations. The Minister said that discussions on that are taking place. Would not it be reasonable to complete those discussions and ensure that people have that protection before they are possibly penalised in the way that has been suggested?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not think so. We are talking about a relatively small number of people. We already know that such an insurance market is developing. There is evidence of people being able to offer precisely the insurance that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
are discussing. The figure from the quarterly statistical inquiry of November 1992 reveals that less than 1 per cent. of people with mortgages have more than £125,000 outstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That figure represents the national average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that. I do not have the regional breakdown and, of course, the figure is likely to vary around the country. But it is some evidence of the number of properties involved and the fact that the Government is entitled to make this change, which is modest in its extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be some confusion as to whether we are talking about the value of the property or the value of the mortgage. Clearly, a significant number of houses are worth more than £150,000, but only a small proportion of houses have a mortgage of that amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. We are talking about a mortgage of £150,000 on a property that is worth considerably more than that. So there may still be cases of people living in very expensive properties, to whom the taxpayer is making a commitment, which some constituents would find difficult to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Social Security Advisory Committee recommended that, if the Government cannot gain assurance, the new regulations should apply only to the eligible interest on new loans or further advances taken out from the date that the regulations come into force. We believe that decisions by borrowers taking on substantial mortgages are not influenced by the safety net offered by income support. We believe that prudent borrowers and lenders would not have entered into high loans without either insurance or, more likely, a substantial equity, which will play its part in times of difficulty. We, therefore, do not accept that recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee recommended that the ceiling should not apply during the 16-week period in which only 50 per cent. of the eligible interest is met. We believe that the 50 per cent. restriction during the first 16 weeks embodies the principle that lenders and borrowers should accept more responsibility in the short term and not expect the benefit system to support even a reasonable mortgage commitment in full from the outset. It would be neither logical nor fair to meet half the interest on reasonable and unreasonable commitments alike. We recognise that the existing provisions for restricting high housing costs operate differently and allow a period of up to one year for the claimant to reduce his commitments. However, the new limit has been set at a level beyond which we believe it would be unreasonable to expect public funding, even in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of the regulations should proceed with caution because of the possible adverse impact on the housing market. The £125,000 limit from April 1994 should be deferred until the position has been monitored. That limit is consistent with our aim to enable owner-occupiers to remain in their homes if their housing costs are reasonable or to give them time, by making a contribution to their lender, to make alternative arrangements if the costs are unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do accept that income support should not have a role in underpinning the housing market, but we acknowledge that, due to lack of personal provision, that may occur. It is unlikely that the small number of owner-occupiers who are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
affected by the regulations would have a bearing on the market, but new policy initiatives are monitored and that will be so with the new regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will try to put the regulations concerning restrictions on people from abroad into context. We are trying to meet the situation in which people from aborad come to this country on the understanding that they will be responsible for their own circumstances and will not have recourse to public funds. We are changing position for the people who try to vary that restriction and while their applications are being considered, income support and other benefits will not be available. The rationale is clear—that those who come to this country on that understanding should maintain themselves, until a decision is made. They are already looking after themselves, they expect to do so and it is not unreasonable that while their application is being considered that they should continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have covered the position in relation to asylum-seekers. Urgent case payments remain for other circumstances—for example, when someone has temporarily lost funds—but it is right to try to close the loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington said that only a small number of people are involved and that we should not be too worried about the matter, but some 10,000 applications a year are made costing some £ 17 million. That is a sizeable number and a sizeable sum. The principle is clear—people who have a responsibility to maintain themselves should do so and not rely on taxpayers. Those who have been granted change of status or exceptional leave to stay remain covered and their position is not threatened. However, the general rationale is clear and there is growing evidence that applications are being made in circumstances in which there is no hope of a change of status. The principle that I have enunciated is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the matter of foreign spouses. The Home Office advises foreign spouses soon after their arrival to apply for leave to remain in the United Kingdom shortly before expiry of the 12-months' period. The foreign spouse is then almost invariably given indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom and can therefore be included in the income support claimant's entitlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly right. Those people are advised not to apply until the end of the 12-months' period. If they are granted change of the status they become entitled to income support, but there may be months, if not years, of delay before their status is determined. It is reasonable that they should receive some financial help, even at the reduced rate of urgent case payments, while they fall foul of the administrative delays imposed by the Government. They have entitlements, but the Government advise them not to apply until the end of the 12 months and they are then penalised because it may be months, if not years, before a decision is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The vast majority of spouses from abroad did not make claims under the procedure. They were content to wait for their applications to be dealt with, and they did not need to have recourse to income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why change the procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the change is clear. The rule, as it stood, was being abused and too many people were applying for the wrong reason. As for the example cited by the hon. Gentleman, I do not believe that such a problem exists in practice, although he raised the point in theory. I do not accept that the majority of cases are subject to a substantial delay. We are discussing a routine operation, when all the visa requirements had been dealt with for bringing a foreign wife to the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman and I both know that that can be a difficult and lengthy process. As soon as those requirements have been accepted and the spouse is in this country, the applications for leave to remain are, in the main, dealt with relatively straightforwardly as no complications should arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practice may develop when foreign spouses apply earlier to ensure continuity. However, we are not aware of circumstances when people who relied on themselves and their families used the opportunity to obtain income support earlier. Consequently, we do not believe that the problem exists in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee the average time that it takes between application and decision in those circumstances? Secondly, the hon. Gentleman said that the system had been abused. Will he give details of such abuse? Thirdly, will he be recommending to the Home Office that its guidelines be changed to encourage such spouses to make application immediately for their status to be changed during the first 12 months, and not, as happens under the present guidelines, to wait towards the end of that time before they make their applications? Clearly, that will have implications not only for social security, but for the administration of the immigration rules at the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I shall report details of our proceedings to my colleagues in the Home Office, but I am not answerable for their part in the arrangements. Once again, the hon. Gentleman is making an issue in theory that has not arisen in practice. It has not been a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue relates to the Government regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The changes will not pose a problem, because the specific group of people to whom the hon. Gentleman referred have not made application under the regulations. They have been content with the current position, looked after themselves, and they know that their application will be accepted—as it will continue to be. There will be no problem for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system has been abused by some people who had no expectation of a change in their circumstances, knew that they were returning to the country from which they had originally come and that, as visitors, had come accepting the restriction that they did not make recourse to public funds. Over time, the ability to apply for a change in that status and the knowledge that it could lead to an income support claim grew. It has resulted in the number of claimants rising, for example, to 10,000 up to last year and £17 million worth of expenditure. Some people made an application within an early time of arriving in this country in order to begin the process and to start receiving benefit. That is wrong, and it is precisely that action that we intend to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman about the matters he raised. The regulations contain an important principle, which is that the taxpayer is ready to support people in this country who fall into difficulties. In many cases, the taxpayer's generosity knows few bounds. However, when we consider, quite properly, that there are individuals who should bear responsibility for their own circumstances and actions, it is right to take action to ensure that that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the gist of the two regulations that seem to be largely unconnected, given that they relate to different groups of people. However, they contain the same kernel to deal with the transfer of responsibilities from the taxpayer to those who should bear them most. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.14am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always amused by the differences in the tone of the Minister from that of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when dealing with social security matters. I cannot but help, contrast the tone of the hon. Gentleman's remarks this morning with those of his right hon. Friend at the Tory party conference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am becoming ever more concerned about the dense wording of statutory instruments. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, from which we have a note, is engaged in an arcane argument with the Department's lawyers. If they cannot satisfy the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments over the setting out of the regulations, who can? I do not impugn their ability. I have concluded that the legal language of the regulations is obtuse and impenetrable to the vast majority of ordinary mortals, including former provincial solicitors who are 10 years out of practice. We all struggle with them. It is becoming a sport for a dwindling number of people who try to make sense of regulations in statutes. The Committee should remember that in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I was insufficiently precise in my questioning of the Minister but he has not persuaded me. I agree with the general thrust of his comment that people should be encouraged to provide for themselves. I remain unconvinced that the previous system relating to mortgage interest could not have been properly restructured. The Minister has rejected that route in regulation 3. I do not believe that the difference between the savings made under the old system and those under the new system is £6 million. The hon. Gentleman may have meant that the total cost may be £6 million. I am prepared to believe that, but the difference in savings between the old system and what he expects to save under the new cannot be what he claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of a new system is what concerns the Committee. Does the Minister have the figures? If he does not, I am not sure that he will be good enough to let us have a written note. The regulations relate to saving money, but, apart from mentioning the £6 million, he has told us nothing. I fail to understand what that figure referred to. Perhaps when he has a minute, the Minister will explain. We must press him on the amount of extra savings that the new regulations will produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have concern for some categories of people. The negative equity problem has been mentioned and I agree with the comments about that. I am especially worried about self-employed people, a group which does not have
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
access to insurance protection as readily as the rest of us. In fact, mortgage insurance protection is almost proscribed for this substantial group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees in liquidation are becoming an increasing problem, especially in localities with heavy redundancies. We all know of those because of the economic turmoil of the past few years. This worries me more than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former divorce lawyer, I am extremely worried about lone parents. It is my experience—this was a problem even 10 years ago—that when marriages break down, spouses separate and wives are left in expensive houses while husbands often go away and makes another fife. The lone parent can be left in traumatic circumstances for several reasons. These include problems with the value of the house and the continuing need to pay mortgage interest. The way in which the regulations could bear down on such people has not been considered properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this change is a harbinger of things to come, we must consider what the consequences might be. The Government are attempting to change the state's role in protecting mortgage borrowers and are looking to the private sector to fill the gap. They could cause considerable difficulties, especially if eventually they update and widen the regulations. First, it would lead to an increase in repossessions because it is inconceivable that private sector schemes could be anything like as comprehensive as those currently offered under the income support regulations. Savings in expenditure on income support would have to be carefully measured against the increased expenditure that would be required for provision for the homeless. That is a long term factor which has to be borne in mind when examining such changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there would be an almost inevitable increase in the cost of mortgage finance because the mortgage companies would have to take account of the fact that there was no safety net—the regulations will erode it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, some potential purchasers would find it difficult to enter the market. I refer particularly to the self-employed. We must be careful about removing the safety net—it has always been known to be in place previously—should the Government try increasingly to save money in a manner similar to that set out in schedule 3 of the regulations. I detect such an approach from various press releases and newspaper reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I counsel caution and advise the Minister to talk again to his colleagues. He should be careful about the changes. I do not discount the fact that steps may have to be taken to contain costs if they seem to be getting out of hand, but the Minister should be careful about what he does in the long term and about going too far, too fast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the Minister the same question about money, costs and savings in relation to schedule 2 of the regulations? I cannot believe that the changes which will affect foreign spouses and other categories of people will save much. It was right to discuss them. I did not catch a figure being given for savings that the Minister expects as a result of the changes. A vulnerable group of people is being threatened with the removal of urgent claims payments. I would be convinced that that step was necessary only if I could be persuaded that public finances were being abused. For the Committee to decide about that, we need to know how much money is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I am also worried, or have been told to be worried by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, about the way the changes will impact on the 1953 convention and subsequent association agreements with the European Community, particularly in relation to Turkish citizens. Social security is a maze, and immigration legislation is an even bigger maze to a provincial solicitor. The 1963 agreement that was made by this country within the EC framework went out of its way to try to make it easier for Turkish nationals to be treated much more like EC citizens. Some of the provisions in schedule 2 of the regulations do the opposite; they are arguably contrary to the spirit of the 1953 convention and undermine the provisions of the 1963 agreement as they affect Turkish citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that is a narrow point, but not in relation to the Kurds who live in Turkey. For them, it is substantial and it could affect people in a dire state coming to this country. The question is not just one of how much money will be saved as a result of the changes, but of how they affect afflicted communities in the rest of Europe and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should explain more to the Committee about the consequences for the groups that I have talked to and also give us a wee bit more information about the amounts of money that will be saved. I am prepared to support the Government's changes if they believe that the social security system is being abused. However, hand on heart, I cannot understand how the two principal changes that we have discussed this morning fall into that category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have discussion from time to time about language. Perhaps it would be helpful if we drafted more solicitors from the Borders into Government legal departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that an offer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, if the hon. Gentleman suffers a misfortune at the next election, there may be an opening. However, the hon. Gentleman's constituents would not let him go easily unless a first-class Conservative candidate stood in his constituency. I take the hon. Gentleman's point about language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee long on mortgage interests. I recognise the points that the hon. Gentleman made about the future. The direction of our policies is clear. We are trying to place greater responsibility on the individual. We acknowledge that steps have to be taken in conjunction with what is happening in, for example the housing market and the insurance market. We have held appropriate discussions and shall continue with them. The limits that we have set should not cause too many anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman returned again to problems with existing restrictions. Criticism was made that outrage was caused during the 12-month period when the restrictions did not apply. The rules stated that if an individual could prove to the Department of Social Security that he was in a position to fund a mortgage, no matter how large, when he took it out, the restrictions would not necessarily apply for a period of 12 months. If we were unable to prove that an individual had deliberately taken out a large mortgage, was going to fall into a difficult predicament and depend on us, we could do nothing about it. We want the pre-existing conditions to remain as generous as they were. Those conditions were designed to cover hard cases. If we failed
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
to do that, the hon. Gentleman would have more cause for concern. The reason for setting the limit was to ensure that in cases where there is a substantial mortgage, people know in advance about the commitment that they will have to make even during the 12-month period. That is not unfair. Existing claimants are not affected. In the case of lone parents, and any future settlement that involves the transfer of mortgage, we shall need to ensure that any top-up element is covered by other provisions. Insurance will have to be arranged in relation to that. Existing claims will not be in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that I gave on costs are over and above the savings that we make under current policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will there be a saving of £6 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In the first year, the restriction will be placed at £150,000. The savings to the taxpayer will be £6 million. When the limit is reduced to £125,000, we expect savings of about £10 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman commented on other parts of the regulations. On costs, I provided a figure earlier of 10,000 people who had abused the system in the past at a cost of £17 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That number of people each year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the number has increased to 10,000 a year. We are talking not about vulnerable people but about visitors to the country who gain entry on the basis that they will support themselves and who, shortly after they apply, say that they want to vary their visas and want to claim income support while they do so. We think that it is fair that, in the meantime, those people remain in the country on the terms under which they originally came. As I said, we retain the means to cover really urgent cases such as temporary loss of income. When the hon. Gentleman examines the issue in more detail, he will realise that we are not being unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the European convention on social and medical assistance, ECSMA, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, go wider than European countries—they include Turkey. Nationals of those states which have signed that convention are admitted to the United Kingdom under the immigration rules. That usually means that they do so on condition that they do not become a charge on public funds. In some instances, they also have work permits which means that they cannot be treated as available for work, which is a basic condition for receiving income support. That prohibition created difficulties when Turkish Kurds were seeking asylum in the United Kingdom in 1988–89, so the regulation was changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any ECSMA national who is an asylum-seeker is not affected by the change. It was never intended that other ECSMA nationals admitted on the condition that they did not become a charge to public funds should be entitled to income support if they tried to vary those conditions. Thus the change from 2 August is in line with Government thinking and restores the original intention. I hope that that explanation has helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the time and consideration of the Committee and I hope that, after due consideration, the regulations can be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a novel experience to wind up a debate, and one that I hope to be able to replicate in the not too distant future. I could get used to it.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I welcome the spirit in which the debate has been held this morning. It has been useful to discuss the points that we wanted to raise. I pay tribute to our advisers who give us such help in teasing out the exact implications of complicated regulations. Although the regulations were defectively drafted we are prepared not to make a great issue of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make two general points. On mortgage interest, I have not been convinced, in common with my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), that there were not already regulations in place which could have been used more effectively. I note the Minister's comments that they did not "necessarily" apply. With a little more imagination on guidelines to social security offices, they might have been able to have been applied. The number of people we are talking about is relatively small, as the Minister has agreed. Therefore, I believe that we are going through regulation changes for the sake of change to make a public statement that something is being done about the problem, which may not necessarily be as grand or as large as the Minister wishes to suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stephen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the old system, the person taking on a very large mortgage would be in some doubt as to whether, if he fell on hard times, the state would pay his mortgage. Under the new system, the extent to which the state will or will not support him is made absolutely clear so that he can make his financial plans accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. I should be surprised, however, if people read social security regulations before they take out mortgages. All I am suggesting is that if they had taken the trouble—as I am sure the hon. Gentleman did—to delve into the social security legislation to check the position before taking out a mortgage, they would have found that there were restrictions.

I welcome the Minister writing to me about the details of the property market in the south-east. As we all know, six months before the abolition of double mortgage tax relief, many double mortgages were taken out. The hike in the property market and the current levelling down of the real value of properties, along with the consequent recession, which led to many people losing their jobs, have had implications on support for those people, especially because so many are still faced with negative equity on their properties. That should be more seriously taken into account.

I believe that the existing regulations were adequate and, if more sensitively or imaginatively applied, could have solved the problem with which the Minister is now dealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, one either applies regulations or one does not. I was making the point that the existing restrictions had their problems. The main problem, which I outlined, was that in some celebrated cases there was a general sense of outrage in the community because, under
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the regulations and the very restrictions supported by the hon. Gentleman, we were not able to act. It was not a matter of being imaginative or not in their use, but one of the law not tackling the problem perceived by the general public. We have therefore introduced the new measures. We are doing our job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to pursue the point further, but one celebrated case was that of a family living in a mansion. Regulations stating that if the home is larger than required, suitable alternative accommodation should be found, would perhaps be a way of tackling that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a time lag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. We shall not persist with this argument. We accept the regulations. However, I believe that it was in response to the public outcry, not the other way round, that the regulations were introduced.

On the matter of leave to remain in the country, I am interested in the Minister's claim that the changes have been introduced because, according to Government figures, 10,000 people were abusing the system, so potential savings could amount to £17 million. Could the Minister write to me with a breakdown of those 10,000 people—what categories they fell into, what countries they came from and the nature of their circumstances was. It is an extraordinary number of people to be abusing the system. I should also like to receive details on where the savings will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire the best breakdown that I can, but I cannot promise that it will be exactly as the hon. Gentleman has requested. We can only do what we can with the information available. I have given the Committee a global total which is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine. If the number of people is 9,999 I shall not quibble, but I should like to have some idea about the detail of the 10,000 cases a year.

I welcome the Minister's assurance. It has been a useful discussion. Due to the nature of the debate and the number of hon. Members in the Committee, it would be inappropriate to move to a vote. We should therefore accept the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Income Support (General) Amendment No. 3 Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 1679).</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Committee rose at twenty-two minutes to Twelve o'clock.</i></p>
