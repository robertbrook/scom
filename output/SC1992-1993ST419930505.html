	<div class='legislation'>Draft Functions of Traffic Wardens
<br><br><!-- lb --> (Amendment) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Charles Wardle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Functions of Traffic Wardens (Amendment) Order 1993.</p></blockquote>
It is good to see you, Mr. Hill, on this spring afternoon. I intend to be brief in my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order amends the Functions of Traffic Wardens Order 1970 to give new powers to traffic wardens, as foreshadowed in the Road Traffic Act 1991. The order will allow wardens to be of greater help to the police in the enforcement of parking offences, thereby releasing police time for Functions of Traffic wardens other duties. It applies to all police forces in England and Wales, but is especially relevant to the Metropolitan police. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I am grateful for the appreciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain in straightforward language the changes that the order will make. The order extends the powers and functions of traffic wardens in four ways. The first is a minor amendment; the other three are more significant changes. First, article 2 adds subparagraph (f) to article 3(2) of the 1970 order and relates to the interim disposal of vehicles under section 99 of the Road Regulation Act 1984. This is a small amendment to ensure that traffic wardens as well as constables can deal with delivery to the local authority of abandoned vehicles removed under the regulations made under section 99. As the explanatory note states, the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles (Amendment) Regulations 1993, which come into force on 1 June, empower a traffic warden to authorise the removal of vehicles that are in breach of parking regulations. That is an order made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, by article 2(g), the order gives traffic wardens the power to authorise the wheel clamping of illegally parked vehicles on public roads. Clamping on public roads is authorised only for a designated area in central London. At present, only a police officer can authorise clamping; as a consequence, police time is tied up supervising that part of parking enforcement. This arrangement is not the best use of police resources. Traffic wardens who deal with parking control day by day are capable of making proper decisions about when it is appropriate to have a vehicle clamped. Police officers are guided by force instructions in this and the same guidance will apply to wardens. I stress that the order relates only to clamping on public roads; it has nothing to do with private land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, article 4 will allow traffic wardens to issue fixed penalty notices for three additional parking offences, two of which are endorsable. They are causing an unnecessary obstruction, parking within the limits of a pedestrian
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
crossing and leaving a vehicle in a dangerous position. The latter two are endorsable. At present, if a warden detects any of those offences, he or she has to rely on a police officer to deal with it. If a warden comes across a vehicle that has been left within the limits of a pedestrian crossing, he cannot do anything about it; he must find a police officer and ask him to help. The offences are, nevertheless, parking offences with which wardens are familiar. The endorsable offences are more serious than other parking offences; they carry a maximum penalty of a £1,000 fine on conviction by a court and three obligatory penalty points. Under the fixed penalty process, the penalty is £40 and three penalty points, if the owner of the vehicle admits guilt and pays up on the fixed penalty system rather than contesting the matter in court. The offence of causing an unnecessary obstruction carries a maximum penalty on conviction of a £1,000 fine. When dealt with under the fixed penalty system, the charge is £30 in London and £20 elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, under article 3, a traffic warden's power to require an offender to produce his or her driving licence will be extended. Traffic wardens will not have a general power to do so, but will be able to require the production only in defined circumstances. The additional circumstances will be when dealing with the two endorsable parking offences that I have mentioned. The power is already available to them when discharging custody functions at a car pound. Therefore, if someone turns up at the car pound, the traffic warden who is there is entitled to ask to see that person's licence. In the other two situations that I described, the warden may now make the same request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new functions proposed in the order provide chief officers of police in England and Wales with the means to increase the role of their traffic warden forces in day to day parking enforcement. Police officers will be able to focus their time on duties of greater priority. However, it is not a change that we make lightly. We recognise that it is important that the new duties to be carried out by wardens are discharged in a proper way and that the training of traffic wardens in the new duties is essential for the handover. We shall stress the importance of training to chief officers of police in the advice that we issue to them about the new order. I believe that the new arrangements have a significant contribution to make to the police service. Therefore, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to ask the Minister several questions about the order. I thank him for his helpful explanation of the order and its intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested that the Minister stressed assistance to the police and relieving the police of a burden of their time. I ask the Minister to give us an assurance about the longer-term intentions in relation to the order. It makes sense for traffic wardens to be able to undertake such functions without having to call on a police officer. But the function of the traffic warden is very much a part of the police service. Will the Minister assure us that, in extending the powers of traffic wardens, there is no intention to change anything in that relationship?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the specific items that this subsidiary legislation would amend. First, he spoke of interim disposal and the powers of traffic wardens to deal with the delivery of abandoned vehicles when there is a breach of traffic regulations. Can the Minister explain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
"interim disposal" and the limitations on this specific power? As I understand it, it would apply only when there is a breach of traffic regulations and not when a vehicle is abandoned without a breach of such regulations. Is that because it would then be a function of the local authority rather than—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, of course, directing my questions to the Minister through you, Mr Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether it is a question of the jurisdiction applying to those two slightly different situations in which a vehicle may be abandoned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister referred to wheel clamping on public roads. In recent times, there has been discussion about what constitutes a public road. The Minister may recall correspondence on breath testing and excess alcohol. As I recall, a road may not be a public road in the sense that it has not been adopted, but may be a public road in the sense that the public are likely to drive on it; there may not be a clear sign saying, "Private Property: Keep Off, so it is reasonable for people to treat it as a public road. I have in mind unadopted highways—for example, where an estate is being built and the highway has not yet been adopted, where a road is part of a road that is within a set of properties owned by a company and leased to individuals or where it is a road in which people co-own properties. As I understand it, the legislation dealing with breath tests and alcohol applies in those circumstances; I hope that the Minister will clarify whether the order does too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it is reasonable for traffic wardens to be able to authorise wheel clamping, as they deal with parking infringements all the time, I know of a Member who would support that proposition. A couple of years ago, he left his flat and found his car missing. He reported the loss to the police and made arrangements to travel to his constituency by other means. For a period, one section of the Metropolitan police was searching for our colleague to tell him that his car had been impounded while another section was searching for the car that had been reported missing. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that, in the public interest, the transfer of responsibilities from police officers to traffic wardens makes allowance for proper information and communication arrangements. In London, those systems ultimately come under the supervision of the chief commissioner of police; elsewhere, they come under the supervision of the chief constable of the police authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third set of offences is the least controversial. The first item in that set concerns unnecessary obstruction caused by a vehicle but, as the Minister noted, the other two are more serious—parking within the limits of a pedestrian crossing and leaving a vehicle in a dangerous position. It is sensible that traffic wardens should be able to tackle those infringements as that will help to deal with them more quickly than if wardens have to involve a police officer. My one reservation is that those offences seem to be committed increasingly often. In my home town of Penarth, the regularity with which the parking restrictions are cavalierly disregarded makes the traffic warden's job very necessary. The offences show a lack of consideration and cause inconvenience, and the latter two particularly put elderly and disabled people and children in special danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
A change that allows traffic wardens to deal with those infringements more speedily is welcome. However, there is a danger that the message will be sent out that the offences are less serious—that they will be put down the tariff—because they have become the responsibility of traffic wardens. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that they are still considered to be very serious offences which should be discouraged, and that the order is intended to strengthen the law, not to minimise the seriousness of the offences. Moreover, I take it that traffic wardens' training and their responsibility to the chief constable or commissioner—referred to by the Minister—would mean that their evidence would be as effective as that of police officers, and would be regarded by the courts as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would also clarify the position on the production of documents. He referred to the production of a licence. I wonder whether that was meant to be an example of how a traffic warden might exercise such powers. Presumably not only the licence, but insurance and other relevant documents could be required by a traffic warden, provided that the legislation were amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On first reading, the legislation seems to offer some common-sense developments in existing practice. We seek an assurance that the legislation will not diminish the importance of combating the lack of consideration and the danger to the public involved in some offences, that the accountability of traffic wardens, through the relevant local senior police officer and ultimately through the chief constable or the commissioner, will continue and that the training given to traffic wardens will be commensurate with their powers and the extension of their responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are fears—encouraged by the comments of some of the Minister's colleagues—that there will be some sort of salami-slicing of police force responsibilities. It makes sense for functions that do not necessarily require the expertise, training and experience of a police officer to be undertaken by traffic wardens, or in certain circumstances by civilians within the police service who have appropriate training. The Opposition and the public in general are worried that the logical extension of that may be to take functions away from the police service. It is important to maintain the integrity of the service, while it is also appropriate that the right sort of person with the right sort of training should undertake the less onerous responsibilities within the police force. I agree with the Minister that that should occur wherever possible to free police officers for the more serious and onerous duties for which they have received training and of which they have gained experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes away responsibilities and diffuses them outside the direct responsibility of the police force, there is a danger of the service losing its integrity in the local area and of its losing the public's respect. Over the years, the function of traffic wardens has developed and is now well understood. It is understood that traffic wardens work within the police service, and that they should be respected and have authority. Systems in towns have developed. For example, an excellent system has developed recently in Cardiff whereby money raised through the local authority's approach to parking restrictions provides additional money to employ traffic wardens, who receive respect. There is a beneficial circle as opposed to the vicious circle that often occurs in other areas. I hope that the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
will be able to reassure us about the Government's long-term intentions on those matters, which are the backdrop against which the regulations need to be seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware of the concern that has been expressed for some time about private wheel-clamping companies. The Minister referred to them. I am concerned that if wheel-clamping by traffic wardens is made legal on the road, it may open the floodgates for private wheel clampers to start clamping on roads. That would give much cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also please clarify the position with regard to unadopted roads, of which there are many, especially in the north of England? Many do not carry signs stating "Private Road"; that may be a grey area of which people could take advantage. Wheel-clamping companies are out to make money; they do not exist to help the flow of traffic. I hope the Minister will clarify these issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.50 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two or three matters worry me, although the first on page 2 of the order, is fairly straightforward. As most traffic wardens are of the female gender, is "he" the most appropriate word to use in drafting the measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I share my hon. Friends' anxiety about whether traffic offences of the sort that we are discussing will be seen to be downgraded. The Litter Act 1983 is an example of the difficulties that some recent legislation has caused for local authorities because powers that were formerly with the police have been transferred to local authority security staff. The same applies in respect of environmental issues when legislation freed the police but the local authority or another body had to pick up the responsibility. The general public do not have the same respect for officers of other authorities as they do for the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I am worried that there will not be enough traffic wardens to carry out the increased responsibilities. In my local authority area, while Nuneaton town centre is well patrolled by traffic wardens and police officers, there is a tremendous difficulty in outlying areas. Some areas with restricted parking are not policed now. The new regulations may be held in disrespect if there are not enough wardens within the chief constable's purlieu. Can the Minister assure me that he will be considering, with the chief constables, whether enough traffic wardens are available to enforce the new regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Warren Hawksley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halesowen and Stourbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions for my hon. Friend the Minister. First, he specified that traffic wardens could ask for driving licences, and the Opposition quickly asked whether insurance documents, too, could be requested. Will the Minister say whether other documents may be required and if the usual practice of asking for documents to be produced at a police station within seven days will apply? It would be different from the normal procedure if people were
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
required to take their documents to a traffic warden or anyone else. I hope that the usual procedure will apply to an order written out by a traffic warden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what is the practice in relation to wheel clamping? There are new wheel-clamping teams in many places. Luckily, I have not been clamped except, on one occasion, on private property and I have no experience of what happens elsewhere. Is it the practice for teams with wheel-clamping equipment to be accompanied by an authorised police officer on all occasions? If so, is it the intention that that officer should be released and that the teams should be accompanied by a traffic warden? How would that work in practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wheel clamping needs expertise; we must ensure that traffic wardens do not over-use the facility for wheel clamping, which should be kept in reserve for serious cases. Only people who have been trained specifically in the use of wheel clamping should carry out that duty. It would be of interest, certainly to me, and I hope to the Committee, if the Minister would explain, in some detail, how it is envisaged that the new power would be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.55 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Angela Eagle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the opportunity of seeking a few reassurances, while broadly supporting the draft legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) said that most traffic wardens—I do not know the figures—are women. The draft legislation proposes to extend the powers of traffic wardens in some areas, which might put women in an awkward position, particularly when they are wheel clamping, when motorists are likely to be more irate. I seek an assurance that in the training that is given and in the new ways of operating that may result from that, women traffic wardens will not be put at more risk of experiencing a violent response from a motorist who possibly would not respond violently when confronted by a police officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be a woman police officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but motorists may respond more violently when confronted by a traffic warden who, certainly in public perceptions, does not have the authority of a police officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes sense to shift the less onerous duties that take up a great deal of police time, but I seek reassurance from the Minister that there is no plan to contract out traffic wardens' jobs to private companies, such as Group 4 Security. Is the regulation a first shift in that process? The confiscation of property or the issuing of tickets is a function of the state and we should not reach the stage where private firms are undertaking such tasks. That point is especially relevant to the comments made by Conservative Members about the way in which some private wheel clampers operate. I have had difficulties with private wheel clampers who behave in a disgraceful way with some of my constituents. I have even heard of some instances in which private wheel clampers have immobilised cars inappropriately—some of those cars are owned by women, who have been left stranded, late at night, in places where they feel unsafe and where they cannot use their car to reach safety. I am worried about that.

Will the Minister assure me that parking enforcement, with which we all agree, is only one element of a problem that is emerging with the vast growth of traffic and car use

generally? Are the Government studying other areas of policy to ensure that parking spaces are available and encouraging people to leave their cars at home—especially if they are going into the city—by providing better public transport?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.58 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the qualified welcome that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael)—leading for the Opposition—gave to the measures and for the welcome given by other hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. Several points have been raised, and with your permission, Mr. Hill, I shall deal with them in reverse order. Inevitably, some hon. Members raised the same issue, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not object if I answer some of his points last. I remember from the last time that we both met that he always digs out refreshingly interesting questions. Certainly, one or two of his points were not raised by other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle), my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) and other members of the Committee spoke about clamping. It might be helpful if I describe the powers that already exist for clamping. There is a difference between clamping on private land and clamping on public roads. Under section 106 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, the Secretary of State for Transport may make orders that determine where clamping can take place on public roads. At present, clamping is permitted only in central London. The relevant boroughs are Kensington and Chelsea, the City of London, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Camden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the law stands, clamping must be authorised by a police officer. The order will extend that power to traffic wardens. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), the Government Whip, is watching me, so I shall be brief. There is a difference between parking attendants and traffic wardens. As the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, traffic wardens constitute part of the civilian staff of the police force, and they are properly trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey referred to private companies. Two contractors carry out clamping: Parking Protection Ltd and Highway Maintenance Service Ltd. However, they may not clamp a vehicle without the authorisation of a police officer, or, when the order comes into force, that of a traffic warden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen, among other hon. Members, mentioned private land. Clamping on private land is covered by the law of trespass. In February, the Home Office published a consultation document on wheel clamping on private land. The consultation period will last until the end of the month. I urge members of the Committee who have any input into the subject to obtain a copy of the document from the Vote Office and to express their views. However, the order has nothing to do with clamping on private land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned wheel clamping procedures and the training available to traffic wardens. Traffic wardens are appointed by police authorities to discharge specific functions that are connected with road traffic matters. They relieve pressure on the police. There is no hint of salami slicing, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth suggested. The police will continue to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
discharge clamping functions. From now on, however, traffic wardens, who are members of the civilian staff of police forces, will also be able to undertake those functions within carefully defined limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief officer of any force decides how to deploy traffic wardens under the aegis of the 1970 order, which the order that we are discussing amends. Their jobs are to enforce parking and fighting regulations, to control traffic, to man car pounds and, in some circumstances, to obtain the name and address of motorists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Hawksley) asked about the documents that have to be produced. Only the driving licence has to be produced, not the insurance document. He is right that under statutory provisions a motorist has so many days in which to produce the document. That applies in the same way as if a police officer had made the request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why only the licence is governed by this provision? On public roads, the question whether insurance cover is in force is extremely important for mobile vehicles and for static vehicles that are in a dangerous position. It is illogical not to request all relevant documents. Can the Minister explain that to us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Traffic wardens deal with parking offences, not with insurance offences, so there is no need to produce an insurance document. All that the traffic warden can do under these limited powers is to deal with parking offences, as I outlined in my opening remarks. They are not concerned with insurance offences. I am getting encouragement from my officials on my interpretation of the regulations. It is not necessary, within the ambit of parking offences, for a motorist to produce evidence of insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I thought that there was agreement between us that parking within the limit of a pedestrian crossing and parking in a dangerous position are offences that are not a bit of a nuisance but especially dangerous. A dangerously parked vehicle may lead to an accident or may force someone who has been unsighted to swerve suddenly to avoid a child crossing a pedestrian crossing. Whether insurance is in force is extremely relevant in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that if there were an accident it would be a different matter, but a parked vehicle may give rise to an accident. The Minister and I take that problem seriously, so I ask him again—I shall speak slowly to enable the information to get through—to explain to us why, when asking for a licence to be produced, the traffic warden should not be able to request the production of insurance and other relevant documents? That would be a sensible corollary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As if by magic, this piece of paper has floated into my left hand. The distinction is between a parking offence and a motoring offence; the very distinction that the hon. Gentleman made. Traffic wardens are only empowered to deal only with parking offences. If a vehicle has been left and it has caused an obstruction, that is an offence. Parking a vehicle within the limits of a pedestrian crossing is a more serious offence, but it is still a parking offence. A parked vehicle that is causing an obstruction is a danger to other road users. For such parking offences, the relevant powers relate to traffic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
wardens as well as to police officers. The other offences to which the hon. Gentleman referred are matters for police officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to take the Committee's time but this is an important point. Unless I have misunderstood the legislation, it is illegal to park a vehicle on a public highway unless it is insured. If the Minister had said that a traffic warden could require the production of the insurance certificate, but not the licence, it would have been more logical. A parked vehicle is a static entity and the licence allows the driver to move the vehicle. Surely, it is logical for the traffic warden to require the production of the insurance document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister follows my logic, the only reason for rejecting my suggestion would be because there is a legal obstruction. If so, it would be helpful to know what that is. When the Home Secretary eventually introduces a Criminal Justice Bill to cover many issues that Members of the House of Commons want to be dealt with, he could perhaps address this issue in a minor subsection. The Minister argument has not carried me with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman goes wider than the scope of these powers because what he has described would create a new power for traffic wardens, for example, the hon. Gentleman said—I take his word for it—that it is an offence to park a vehicle on a public road without it being properly insured. Even though it is not insured, that vehicle may be parked perfectly properly and in area that would not attract the attention of a traffic warden because no parking offence has been committed. In that case, the traffic warden has no scope to probe whether the owner of the vehicle has insurance. It is not a matter for a traffic warden. An insurance offence means driving without insurance, and that is well beyond the powers in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the Minister. One may not use a vehicle without insurance, but having a vehicle on the road constitutes using a vehicle. I am pretty sure that I am correct in saying that an offence is committed if a vehicle is static on a public road and no insurance is in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law should be enforced as strictly as possible on these three elements. People should have a proper and valid driving licence, they should have paid road tax and they should have insurance. Of those three elements, the most potentially damaging to the public is the failure to have insurance. Someone may be maimed for life and not receive compensation because there is no insurance against which to claim. As a magistrate, it struck me that not having a valid insurance policy was one of the most serious motoring offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the opportunity to enable traffic wardens to check on that essential element. Surely, the Minister will accept that it is sensible for traffic wardens to ask for the relevant document to be produced. To make the provision so narrow that they can ask for only the licence to be produced is to fail to follow the logic that the Minister used in trying to persuade us to accept the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to recognise that I am trying to be helpful to him as well as to the administration of the law. I urge him to think again. If the Minister has committed an oversight or made a mistake and the order has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
introduced in an incomplete form, we should recognise that and seek an early opportunity to rectify it. Surely, the Minister accepts the logic of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Road tax has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I was under the impression that traffic wardens already had the power to check tax documents. I have seen them doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is out of order. He intervened when the Minister had not said that he would give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following your broad hint, Mr. Hill, I shall give way in a moment. First, however, I shall deal with the argument expounded so enthusiastically by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I understand why he called for greater scope, but am bound to tell him that his argument does not apply under the order. I must resist the temptation to expand the order's scope of the order for several reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic wardens are already trained to deal with parking offences. We are discussing offences which they identify as a matter of daily routine, but to do something about the particular offences that I described earlier, such as parking within the limits of a pedestrain crossing, they must seek the co-operation of a police officer. The different offence of using a vehicle without insurance goes beyond the planned remit for traffic wardens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give way to my hon Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge in a moment. Perhaps discourteously, but in the hope of anticipating what he was going to say, I shall continue. If my hon. Friend referred to excise duty offences, he was right. In the list of duties in which traffic wardens are trained, there is included spotting the offence of a vehicle without an up-to-date tax disc. That is one of their responsibilities, but in turn—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so after I have discovered whether my hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge wants me to give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, in turn, does not relate to the expansion of their powers under the 1970 order, which will be amended by the order that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for rightly prejudging my question. I was sure that it was within the power of a traffic warden to take action onthe non-payment of excise duty. It is extraordinary that that power should not be extended—if necessary—to include the requirement for insurance and MOT documents to be produced. It would not be that much harder to train a traffic warden to ask for insurance documents. I agree with the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that that is the most important thing that needs to be checked—a car should carry insurance. Consideration should be given to conferring such a power in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his constructive and interesting suggestion. It could well be that there is scope for the further useful employment of traffic wardens, who already do such an excellent job, for which they are trained. I shall bear his comments in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised the hon. Member for Nuneaton that I would give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall cite an example to the Minister. A traffic warden stops someone and gives him a parking ticket because he has parked illegally, making the driver liable to prosecution. The warden asks the driver for his driving licence. The driver does not have his licence with him, and has to present the licence at a police station within 14 days. Failure to produce a valid licence proves that that person has been driving without a licence. Is not it the case that the police would prosecute? Surely the same could apply to someone driving without a valid insurance certificate? I cannot see a difference or a problem. It is common sense that when one document is asked for, so should the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, the offences for which traffic wardens are being given increased scope are strictly parking offences. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that if the police were to stop a vehicle and ask a driver for his insurance certificate, and if he did not have one, it would be a matter for the police. It would not come within the scope of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman again in a moment, and then to the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could understand that point if the Minister had not said in his preamble that a new circumstance would be that traffic wardens would have the power to ask for a driving licence. Perhaps I misheard the Minister. I understood him to say that under the order, a traffic warden may ask to see a licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But only in the specific circumstances that I outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the reason why traffic wardens will not be able to ask for insurance certificates is that the offence is a parking offence—albeit that a certificate of insurance is required for a vehicle to be static on a public highway. Can the Minister explain the logic behind a warden not being able to ask for an insurance certificate while being able to ask for a driving licence, because the licence would be needeed to drive the vehicle? That seems a bizarre approach by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to help the hon Gentleman a number of times, but I shall try once more. The licence is needed to deal with the offences that I listed at the beginning. There is no need to produce an insurance certificate to deal with those parking offences. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be encouraged to hear me remind him that the scope of the amendment order is very limited—it is limited to certain parking offences with which traffic wardens are familiar because of their work. They are offences which, at present, require wardens to seek help from a police officer under the order, wardens will be able to handle those offences themselves, leaving police officers to go about their duties elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for a second. I have tried to explain in as many ways as I can the precise scope of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I should like to return to questions from the hon. Members for Nuneaton and for Wallasey, which related to training. The hon. Lady was worried about the vulnerability of some traffic wardens. I can tell her that all wardens are being trained to deal with awkward cases. From their existing training, they can deal with someone who loses his cool. Under the order, they will have radios to seek assistance. I agree with the hon. Lady that this is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nuneaton asked about training in relation to clamping and to the new parking offences. He hoped that those measures would not downgrade the powers because of cases being handled by traffic wardens as well as by police officers. He may be reassured that there is no such danger. It is for chief officers to decide how many traffic wardens to employ on their civilian staff, and how to deploy them. That is reflected in the fact that in the Metropolitan police area in January, there were 1,760 traffic wardens and in the 42 other police forces, there were 3,313 wardens trained as members of the civilian staff of police forces and subject to the same disciplines. Members of the Committee will appreciate that local authorities employ parking attendants whose duties are far more limited; they can simply dish out excess notices when someone has overstayed his welcome on a parking meter. A traffic warden receives an altogether different training. The Metropolitan force has already developed a training package on the new offences for traffic wardens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee the briefest sample of the issues covered in the training. They include regulation 9 of the Zebra Pedestrian Crossing Regulations 1971—stopping within the limits of pedestrian crossings; regulation 18(1) of the Pelican Pedestrian Crossings Regulations and General Directions 1987 and section 25(5) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The training is thorough and the scope of the order is limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen were anxious about unadopted roads. This may sound somewhat churlish, but what I am about to say will be of some satisfaction to the hon. Gentleman. He will be reassured to know that I shall write to him and to my hon. Friend on the subject as soon as possible. I understand that these offences apply to parking on public roads. Lawyers can delve into the definition of a public road in respect of parking offences on unadopted roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although parking restrictions would not apply on an unadopted highway, other regulations—for example, those that relate to pedestrian crossings—would. It is possible for a car to be parked in a dangerous position on an unadopted road. Clearly, some offences would apply on unadopted roads—new estates, for example, when a local authority is waiting for the contractor to complete the road to the necessary standard. There are, of course, other privately owned highways and areas to which the public has general access and clarification of the position is needed. I shall be happy to await the Minister's considered response to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's further remarks are helpful. I shall be surprised if he is right to suggest that there could be a pedestrian crossing on an unadopted road. My impression is that usually—certainly in east Sussex—these are matters for the county engineer. To persuade a county engineer to agree to an extra pedestrian crossing on a public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
road, especially a trunk road, which may affect the Department of Transport's traffic measurement is one thing; to get him to do so for an unadopted road is another matter altogether. However, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth mentioned interim disposals. On a public road, the enforcement powers referred to are for illegal parking. If a vehicle—the distinction may interest the hon. Gentleman—is found to be abandoned, it becomes a matter for the local authority to deal with. The order is concerned with parking offences, as I said. The nature and scope of the order is limited, but sensible and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.29 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should traffic wardens at least be able to ask people to produce their insurance certificates? The Minister says that traffic wardens should train for such additions to their duty. It takes a minimal level of training for a traffic warden to tick the appropriate box on a form and to say to the vehicle owner that he must produce his insurance certificate at a police station within the next seven days, or whatever is the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be an undervaluing of traffic wardens; some of my best friends are traffic wardens. The success of the Penarth and Dinas runners, of which I am a member, is due to the excellence of its secretary who is a traffic warden in Penarth. I have every confidence that he and his colleagues are intelligent enough to do the job of asking motorists to produce their insurance within a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay the Committee in its deliberations or to delay the statutory instrument, by challenging the Minister to provide an explanation that makes sense. With the greatest respect to him, he has endeavoured bravely to make sense of the legislation, but he has failed. He could say that the legislation does not allow such an extension. If that is so, the correction of that anomaly must be considered when a Criminal Justice or Road Traffic Bill is before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simple common sense that if a vehicle is left on a public highway, where it is dangerous or is an obstruction, or if it is left on the restricted area associated with a pedestrian crossing, it is likely to cause an accident. Therefore, it is sensible to ensure that there is an insurance policy. That is surely in the interests of the general public and should be pursued. Having a driving licence is, in many ways, less important to the general public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, having a driving licence, having a certificate of insurance and—to a lesser extent—having proof of taxation of the vehicle—and other road traffic legislation-are important at any time and if there are simple ways in which to encourage the observation of such legislation, we should seek them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The knowledge that a requirement can be made by the traffic warden in such circumstances to require the insurance certificate to be produced would be an encouragement and might well highlight transgressions of the law. If the Minister cannot accept that that interpretation should be placed on the statutory instrument, he should study and reconsider the point. I look forward to his further observations on it and I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that on reflection, he may agree that the comments in the Committee—not only by myself, but by the hon. Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge and by my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton—suggest a sensible course for the Government to take which would be consistent with the legislation that we are considering so amicably in Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned some minor matters, such as the need for information systems and the compatability of information available to traffic wardens and police officers. I asked the Minister whether he would confirm that enforcement of certain offences by traffic wardens does not diminish the seriousness with which they should be regarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the fact that the validity and dependability of evidence of traffic wardens in court should be seen as equivalent to that of police officers, in view of the extending of powers to traffic wardens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Charles Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth to leave the Committee dissatisfied in any way. I seek rapidly to answer some of his points. I share his admiration for the work done by traffic wardens as, I am sure, does the Committee. The purpose of their additional training is to ensure that they can perform the additional functions with the same professionalism that is now displayed by the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertook to write to the hon. Gentleman on unadopted roads, but I must disappoint him on his desire for the order to have greater scope. On insurance, I repeat that traffic wardens' functions are limited to the stationary vehicles—to parking and vehicle excise offences. To give them functions concerning the use of motor vehicles on a road without insurance would require much broader powers and the Government are not contemplating that. I shall reread the debate in 
	<i>Hansard</i> on the Bill which became the Road Traffic Act 1991 to discover whether the hon. Gentleman expanded on that theme. His thoughts are on the record now. The hon. Gentleman referred to the deployment, behaviour, and training of traffic wardens and those are matters for the chief officer. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the provision applies to parked vehicles which are, therefore, stationary. The requirement to have a valid insurance policy in force applies to stationary vehicles on a public highway. The Minister's logic is faulty. He has asserted his position, but he has not explained it or justified it. I hope that he will reflect on our interesting and constructive debate and that he will be persuaded that the Order leaves an anomaly as a result of not thinking through the matter consistently. We shall return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
