	<div class='bill'>EMPLOYMENT BILL</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. I wonder whether at some stage you would be prepared to consider a motion that further consideration of the Bill be adjourned, so that we may know the Government's intentions. Bearing in mind that only six weeks ago the House gave the Bill a Second Reading, many of us were astonished to hear the Secretary of State for Employment say on television last night, being interviewed by Mr. Vincent Hanna on the new programme "Newsnight", that it was the Government's intention to introduce what by any description could only be far-reaching amendments to the Bill—proposals which would change the Bill drastically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has any objection to the Secretary of State appearing on television and being interviewed. Some would say that it is his duty from time to time so to do, provided that others with an opposite view get equal time and opportunity. But I and many of my hon. Friends would regard it as a great discourtesy to the Committee, and particularly to the House, if the Secretary of State were to go on television and suggest that changes were to be made before he had the courtesy to tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State cannot be here this morning, I understand, because of his responsibilities to the Cabinet, and I do not suppose that the Under-Secretary is in a position to make a statement about the changes which the Government intend to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is another most serious aspect to this which came out of the interview last night. The Secretary of State, who on some occasions is very skilful, allowed himself to be drawn into discussing the Court of Appeal cases. It initially related to the Express Newspapers v. Mac Shane case, but by implication it drifted into the current dispute with the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and, as I understand it, the House of Lords Appeal Committee is to meet this morning to decide whether there should be an appeal. If leave to appeal is granted, the House of Lords will take it on Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
As I am sure you are aware, Mr. Goodhew, we have carefully avoided saying anything about that judgment in the Committee. There was a passing reference to it by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), but we have avoided reference to it in any detail here and on the Floor of the House. Even the Secretary of State for Industry, who is no shrinking violet, on Monday quite properly avoided being questioned on the subject when it came up during his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the position as serious. What the Secretary of State suggested on television last night were quite drastic changes. The House gave the Bill, which we are here to consider in detail, a Second Reading in good faith, and we felt that we had got at least a definitive statement from the Government on their approach to it. Now we find that it will be changed during the Committee stage. There was a hint from the Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. None of these are matters for the Chair. Indeed, the Chair could not possibly accept a motion to adjourn further consideration on the basis of events that take place outside the House. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman, to whom I have allowed a certain amount of latitude with his points, will appreciate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to get on with consideration of the Bill as it now stands. Should the Government table new clauses at any stage, we should have ample opportunities to discuss such matters then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for that, Mr. Goodhew, and I do not wish in any way to challenge your ruling. The only point that I am trying to make is that, surely, if the Secretary of State is to introduce changes to the Bill, it would be better for him to come to the Committee in the first instance and say that changes will be made. It is of crucial importance, as we know. All employment legislation that we have had before the House in the past 13 years is of crucial importance. Balloting, secondary picketing and the closed shop all hang together in the context of this Bill, and to ask the Committee at this stage to continue the debate the Bill on the first clause when we are not yet in a position to know how the Government are to change it is asking a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at this stage asking the Secre-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
tary of State to be sent for from the Cabinet. It is a good thing that he should be using his minority voice in Cabinet. But it would be very helpful if the Under-Secretary could give some outline of how the Government propose to lay amendments, when they propose to introduce them, whether they will introduce a discussion document, and all the other factors to which I have referred. I am sure that, if that were done, we should be able to proceed with the amendments on the Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary cannot debate it on any of the matters which are coming before us this morning. If he wishes, on a point of order, to reply to the right hon. Gentleman it is open to him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. I am grateful for your indulgence. As anybody who knows my right hon. Friend will be aware, not the slightest discourtesy was intended to this Committee, to the House, or to anybody else. But what my right hon. Friend said last night reflected faithfully what he said to the House on Second Reading. The right hon. Gentleman complains that six weeks ago we had a Second Reading and nothing was there said that could foreshadow in any way what my right hon. Friend said in a brief interview last night. May I refer to what my right hon. Friend then said, referring to the Mac Shane case:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This case raised issues of central importance to our review. We are now considering their Lordships' judgment carefully. We shall take whatever action seems necessary in the light of that judgment and bring it before the House in due course. There are vital and delicate matters which will require a great deal of thought."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 68.]</p></blockquote>
What my right hon. Friend said last night related exclusively to that judgment and to the implications that flow from it. He said in terms that the Government intended very shortly to produce a consultative document, and I am able to give the assurance that, when that is produced, this Committee will have it first. The nature of the consultative document will be precisely that of the other consultative documents that we issued throughout last summer and autumn. It is the intention
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
that the Government will receive views on the proposals there set out, and, depending upon those proposals will be the nature of whatever amendment to the Bill it is thought right to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend said last night that it was the Government's intention, after consultation, to introduce an amendment to the Bill. I hope that that makes perfectly plain that what took place last night was an expression of intent, that the discussion paper will be very shortly issued, and that nobody shall see the discussion paper before the Committee does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has fairly quoted from what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the right hon. Gentleman on a point of order? I hope that the Committee recognises that these are not matters for the Chair. The Chair does not wish to appear oppressive with the Committee and will therefore allow a certain latitude on points of order, but if this is allowed to go on for too long, clearly it will be a bad precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, indeed, a point of order, Mr. Goodhew, because it is related to precisely the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman made. I wish to refer to something said on the Floor of the House in anticipation of precisely such a situation. You will see the relevance, Mr. Goodhew. In winding up for the Opposition, and expecting the hon. and learned Gentleman to reply to what I and others had said in the debate, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the most serious thing yet to come is the declared intention of the Secretary of State, in the aftermath of the decision of the House of Lords in Express Newspapers v. Mac Shane, to spit in the face of their Lordships by bringing in amendments to restrict the application of section 13 of the 1974 Act. Such amendments may well have serious consequences both for the law and for industrial relations. For that reason, we should have considered debate and decision by the whole House, not a dramatic reform being slipped in as a postscript to the Bill in Standing Committee."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 151.]</p></blockquote>
We now learn that is what is contemplated and may well be done. It amounts almost to a constitutional outrage, and it is at the least an affront to the House of Commons for this Committee to be considering a Bill in the shadow of other events that may be more dramatic than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
anything in the Bill itself. A dialogue is taking place outside the House, and Members of Parliament in this Committee are presumed to be picking it up after all other considerations. It is outrageous. It is treating in Committee with contempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman was addressing me on a point of order, perhaps I should make clear that the duty of the Chair is to see that the Bill makes progress in on orderly fashion. The Chair has no responsibility for these other matters which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. May I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman whether it is the Government's intention to bring forward amendments on the lines that he suggested to this Committee or on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member may address his remarks only to the Chair. If he does that and tries by what he says to encourage the Under-Secretary to rise again on a further point of order, I shall have to see how long this goes on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member may address his remarks only on the Chair. If he does that and tries by what he says to encourage the Under-Secretary to rise again on a further point of order, I shall have to see how long this goes on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be interesting for the Committee to know whether amendments are to be made in Committee stage or be brought to the Floor of the House. That would shape our attitude towards the amendments and to progress in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I between helping the hon. Gentleman and contravening your instruction that we should not repeat ourselves, Mr. Goodhew. But I say—for the second time, I believe—that it is the Government's intention to introduce an amendment in this Committee so that it may be fully examined and discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. Is it possible for you to obtain further advice from Mr. Speaker on the question of precedent? Clearly, we may be creating a precedent by enabling the Government to introduce innocuous Bills on Second Reading and drastically reform them in Committee. When it has been through all its stages, the Bill may be entirely different from the one that was debated on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government are
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
upset about the judgment in the case involving the National Union of Journalists. They hastily said, or gave hints, that they intended to amend the Bill in the light of that judgment. Incidentally, when the steel workers are faced with a judgment, they are told that they must not go beyond the law—they must uphold the law and so on—but when the Government are faced with a judgment that they do not like they hasten forward with amendments so that the law can be changed to suit their view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears from guarded hints that have been given that there will be some drastic changes in the Bill. As a consequence, we are liable to end up with a Bill which has not been debated on Second Reading. Therefore, in order that we do not create a precedent, would it be possible for you to take opinion from Mr. Speaker and his officers as to whether the Bill can be drastically reformed during the Committee stage so that it may bear no relation to the Bill debated on Second Reading?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be possible for you, Mr. Goodhew at the next meeting of the Committee to give us the benefit of your opinion when you have had an opportunity to judge the facts that we putting before you this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everything that has happened so far in the Committee has been in order, except what we have just been doing, which was to discuss as points of order things which are not a matter for the Chair and have taken place outside the House. I appreciate the anxiety of right hon. and hon. Members, but as it has been made clear that it is the intention of the Government to introduce amendments to the Bill, there will be ample opportunity to debate them in the Committee. Furthermore, there will be the opportunity to look at them again when they come to the Floor of the House. So I do not think that we should spend much more time on this. I should prefer to get the Committee back into order so that we may proceed with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew, and without wishing to prolong matters, may I say that one advantage at least has come from these exchanges and, in particular, the contribution of the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher), than whom there is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
more experienced Member in industrial matter. When he described the bill as innocuous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say that it depends on how the Bill ends up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should prefer that we get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to raise a point of order on a matter which is really for me, I shall appreciate it if he will keep it short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a short point of order, Mr. Goodhew,—in support of what my right hon. and hon. Friends have said. What is worrying us about this situation is that we have said on number of occasions already that the Bill hangs together as a package but now, when we are discussing clause 1, we cannot be certain that new matter introduced into the Bill later will not have implications for things that we have already discussed and will discuss in the immediate debates before us. That is why we think it right that we should know at the earliest opportunity what is in the Government's mind, preferably before we make further progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me. The hon. Gentleman says that all parts of the Bill hang together as a package. I fear that we shall all hang together for being out of order if I let this run on too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should prefer to go on to the next amendment, but I see the hon. Member pleadingly looking at me and trying to catch my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. May I first apologise for having to raise this point of order. I am sure that you and I and the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) will have the feeling that we have been round this track before in another Committee—I accept that I cannot discuss these events in this Committee—but the Government seem to be falling into the trap of introducing Bills on Second Reading and then
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
making substantial changes at some stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will recall that we had this problem on the Industry Bill and we had long exchanges on points of order, which were happily resolved, getting everyone off the hook, when, after some discussion, you agreed to accept a motion that the Committee adjourn so that the issues which were troubling the Committee could be cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) spoke of seeking the adjournment of the Committee. We are in double difficulty because, as was the case in the Industry bill Committee, the Secretary of State responsible for the fracas in the first instance is not present. I appreciate that it is not for you to advise the usual channels how to go about their business, and what I ask you to do, Mr. Goodhew, is to give considerations to whay my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) has said about seeking further advice at a more senior level about the precedents involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly undertake to have discussions through the usual channels about an adjournment motion, which may or may not be successful on a subsequent occasion, but I feel that the events in the Industry Bill Committee, which you chaired so splendidly, Mr. Goodhew, have relevance for us. You will recall the dispute that we had on the money resolution problem. We have now had the money resolution and the Government amendments have been tabled, and these are raising issues which were not in the Bill in the first instance and which will cause a good deal of trouble on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that I may be getting near the bounds of order, Mr. Goodhew, but I feel that the Government are being somewhat discourteous to the chairman of the committee. Clearly, when he made the broadcast, the Secretary of State would appreciate that the matter would be raised at some length in this Committee the following morning. He is not here to be questioned on his statements and on the far-reaching consequences of what he has suggested. I do not accept that his statement on Second Reading covers the point. I think that many of us who listened to the Secretary of State formed the opinion that we could even have a second Bill, not an amendment of such far-reaching consequence to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, Mr. Goodhew, with humble
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
apologies to you for having raised this matter. I beg you to consider what my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) has said and look for further guidance. I shall undertake to have some discussions through the usual channels about the suitability of an adjournment motion at the next sittiong of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing out of order except what we have been doing for the past 22 minutes. We would be wise to get back into order. As for the other matters, the Chair has onerous enough responsibilities without having to accept responsibility for what the Government do, or what the Opposition do. He is merely responsible for seeing that the committee behaves in an orderly manner, and I hope that we can now move on to amendment No. 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot read it from here, but I understand that it indicates—and I have always understood that it indicated—that the debate was being taped for possible broadcast. I had a feeling in past sittings that hon. Members were aware of that, judging by the speeches they made and the slight amount of repetition in exchanges between hounourable and right hon. Gentlemen. I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
that the drawing of attention to it will not encourage them still further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked because, frankly, I did not know. I am glad that I now do know that it means that our proceedings are being broadcast or being taped for broadcasting.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pretend to be in your league, Mr. Goodhew, but I turn now to the amendment. I shall speak about the policy reflected in both the amendment and the clause of which I hope it will form part. The amendment springs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
from the remarks of the Under-Secretary of State at our first sitting, which I thought caused considerable surprise to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, to the effect that, contrary to what we had assumed and to the way the clause is drafted, the Government's proposals to finance ballots are limited to postal ballots, at least at this stage. We are dependent on what the Under-Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, the intention is that the costs shall be limited to postal ballots and their expenses, and not of a work-place ballot." [
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 24 January 1980; c. 33.]</p></blockquote>
I was surprised not only by the policy reflected in that but by the prefatory words "for example". If that was an example, one wonders what other matters are not mentioned in the clause that might be other "for examples" on some other occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our second sitting, the Under-Secretary suggested that if any union was in doubt about what the clause covered and what its scope would be, the union—I think I quote him aright—should clear it with the certification officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that that means that the certification officer is the person who will interpret the section, as it will be, and the subsequent scheme embodied in regulations that will be made under that section. Presumably, therefore, it is open to him to say that this, that or the other is not ruled out by what is in the clause. But is he also to take account of what the Under-Secretary of State said in Committee and say "None the less, the Under-Secretary of State said that the money is only for postal ballots"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that only to illustrate yet again how some of the things which, no doubt, seemed simple to the Government when they were drafting the Bill and contemplating the scheme are not so easy and simple in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to my criticism of the exclusion of such ballots as are envisaged in our amendment from the scope of the proposed scheme. At the first sitting I touched on the glaring inequity that would exist between the democratic provisions and procedures of the National Union of Mineworkers and the no less democratic procedures and provisions of the rules and arrangements of my own union, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
Workers. I pointed out that under the scheme as envisaged in the clause and as outlined by the Under-Secretary, my union—which already has postal ballots for the election of its officers and its president—will presumably be able to go to the Government and recoup all or part of the very substantial sum involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My union has over 1 million members, and with the round postage trip at 24p—because in order to secure a high return, return postage is paid and first-class postage will go up next Monday to 12p each trip—quick arithmetic suggests that it will be roughly £¼ million a time, apart from printing and other costs. Perhaps at some stage the Under-Secretary will show us what arithmetic was used to reach the £2 million contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My union would be able to recoup that large sum of money, presumably, but the union of my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) would not for, say, electing its president. I understand that the NUM does it not by post but by the probably equally democratic process of putting the ballot papers in the box at the pithead, much as is done at a general election. We do not have postal votes for the overwhelming mass of the electorate. We require them to use shanks's pony, to go along, put their cross on the paper and slip it into a box, and everyone thinks that perfectly proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that procedure used at present by the National Union of Mineworkers is used in the future, Mr. Gormley, Mr. McGahey and Lawrence Daly will not be able to come along with their hands out to get money back from the Government. They will have to find it themselves, despite the fact that it is public money about which we are talking. That is quite indefensible. To imply that the methods of voting that we use to secure our own election is one that we cannot smile upon and approve when it is used in the industrial relations is quite inexplicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we have yet another purpose, Mr. Goodhew, and I assure you that I have to wish to make a protracted debate about it. There is another practical reason. The public expressions of hon. Members on the Government side suggested that the principle reason why they wanted this provision in the Bill was to do something about industrial disputes—the idea that chaps will vote differently if they put their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
cross on a piece of paper in secret instead of standing on a football field or Doncaster race course being adjured by a shop steward to put up their hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not enter into argument about that. I have made clear my sympathy for the whole idea of ballots. The clause envisages the use of ballots for certain purposes, and certainly envisages that there may well be situations where a ballot may be an appropriate method of taking a decision to embark upon industrial action and equally to take a decision to withdraw industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, speed may be important. It is a much speedier way for the chaps to go along and put their ballot papers in a box rather than leave it to the vagaries of the postal system. I hesitate to appear critical of the postal system, but we all know that from time to time it has its hiccoughs. That is another factor. We cannot ignore the wider practical issues of the mechanics of organising postal ballots and workplace ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the widespread assumption that, in the kind of situation upon which I have touched, everybody will know who is to be balloted. It requires a list of names and addresses to send the ballot papers to the chaps and to give them a stamped addressed envelope in which to return them. That is thought to be the end of the mechanics of the matter. But we have seen that in practice it is not as simple as that. I remember the Grunwick situation. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), unfortunately, is not with us at the moment, but he will remember that one of the great difficulties that the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service ran into was the reluctance of the employer to provide the necessary information to enable it to carry out a postal ballot. I wonder how many other situations may arise where the Government may have envisaged the use of these provisions where they will be frustrated because they are tying themselves down to postal ballots but where in practice it might well be possible to conduct a ballot if the chaps whose names and addresses were not available could put their papers in a ballot box just as we do at general elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is so obvious that if the hon. and learned Gentleman made a slip of the tongue, speaking off the top of his head and saying something that was not really a reflection of the Government's full com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
mitment to postal ballots, the Committee will entirely understand. But if that was not the case, I can only hope that I have been able to persuade him by showing him the weakness of his approach and that he will be prepared to accept our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and ballots conducted at meetings of divisional or district or trade councils or branches of a trade union".</p></blockquote>
My amendment is not intended in any way to weaken or to detract from my right hon. Friend's amendment, which I fully support. But I do not think that for a great many trade unions our decision on this amendment will matter very much. In my own union, we shall go on conducting our ballots in the way in which we have conducted them up till now, because that is the way in which our members want to conduct them. If they wanted them conducted in any other way, they would presumably, at one of our rules revision conferences, have amended the rules to provide for that. That is the way in which our members want them conducted. That is the way in which we have always conducted them and in which we shall go on conducting them, irrespective of this Bill. We have paid for them up till now, we pay for them now, and we shall go on paying for them. We shall not be suborned by the Governments' largesse into departing from practices hallowed by tradition and reinforced by the support of all the members concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are talking this morning not about anything which will issue much in action but to establish a principle and to examine, perhaps a little academically,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
the relative virtues of Greek city state democracy—democracy by referendum—on the one hand, and the vast sophisticated representative democracy which is the basis of the working not only of trade unions but of almost all institutions in this country which operate on any sort of democratic basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not a Greek city state. A large and complex society like ours cannot operate in the way that a Greek city state operates. We cannot get all our citizens into the market place on a Saturday evening and get their views. Nor can we ballot them on all their views. The only example we have had of a referendum, a universal ballot to make a political decision rather that an election to a representative democratic institution, is the referendum of June 1975 on whether we should continue in membership of the European Economic Community. It is not without significance that, on the only occasion on which we proceeded by universal ballot to make a single political decision, we make what is now almost universally agreed to be an error of the utmost gravity. Indeed, so far is it universally agreed that I find it difficult these days to find anyone who will confess to having voted "Yes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not work that way. The best way for a democracy to work is for decisions to be taken democratically by the votes of those who care and those who go to the trouble of informing themselves. It sounds awfully nice and theoretically democratic to say that everybody votes by post. But in a trade union or, for that matter, a political party one does great damage if one says that on certain issues—the selection of certain people or the making of certain policies—the man who will not get off his bottom and away from his telly for one evening a month to go to his branch shall have the same power of decision as the man who does not merely get the benefit of trade union membership but carries out the obligations, does the chores, takes honorary office, recruits members, negotiates as a lay officer, raises money for the organisation and participates in the making of the policy of the organisation. One man may be a quiescent member, a card holder, who joins merely for convenience or perhaps out of marginal conviction, but not enough conviction to get him to take his coat off one evening a month. Are we to say that that man should have an equal voice with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
man who gives up some of his time to see that the organisation functions, the man without whom the organisation would not function?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great thing about our trade unions, by contrast with the so-called trade unions in totalitarian States, is that they are largely run by voluntary labour. The professional element in the organisation is a very small proportion in terms of the load which they bear compared with the totality of the load which is borne by the lay people doing the job. The organisation would not run without those chaps. Are we to take advantage of the work that they do and then say that that does not give them any more rights or say-so than the fellow who never goes to his branch or goes just to pay his dues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that there was a tremendous battle within the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, Engineering Section, on this very question of the introduction of postal ballots for full-time officials? The heart of the battle related to the future life of the branch. It was said that if members did not need to attend their branch to do anything at all because their ballot forms would be sent to them by post to be filled in the quietness of their own homes and sent back to head office, part of the necessity for the branch in the first instance was being removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend also aware that an additional move within the trade union movement in the past few years is the check-off system, by which the member's contributions are deducted at source by his employer and sent to the union head office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one links the postal ballot, on the one hand, and the check-off system on the other, one has virtually removed entirely any requirement for branch life, and one has also removed the opportunity for any but the most dedicated to participate in all the other trade union activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend. To some extent, he has anticipated what I was about to say. I have been at many branch meetings where there are perhaps 300 members in the branch, and 30, 40, 50 or 60 chaps have come along. They come at the beginning of the meeting and go through the agenda. Another 150 will come in, get as far as the door and the collector, hand over their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
sub and walk out again. Sometimes they walk no further than 20 yards to the bar in the same building. Is it to be said that those two have an equal right to a say-so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend has just said is right. The check-off system means that they do not even have to pop their head in the door in many cases, especially in the case of those who work for very large employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is necessary to make provision for postal voting in addition to voting at branches and so on, because there are some chaps who, for one reason or another, cannot get to meetings. We do that in my own union. Nearly all our voting is done at branches, but there is provision for members to claim a postal vote, and quite a lot do. In particular, there are two groups of people of quite significant numbers who do that. The first comprises those whose employment takes them abroad. We have a great many members, for example, in airline operation a chap will be sent to a maintenance base at Rome or Karachi, sometimes for a couple of years. Clearly, it would be grossly unjust to deny him his opportunity to vote, because he will never get to branch meetings during that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other substantial group of voters occurs when there is shift working and when the branch meeting takes place at a time which is convenient to the chaps on the largest shift. But, inevitably, that means that some chaps on other shifts cannot get to the branch meeting. Therefore, one is not talking about disadvantaging people who, with the best will in the world, cannot take advantage of what I call attendance at a piece of representative democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that my amendment (a) is probably not very well drafted. Indeed, it does not cover all the contingencies that I should like it to cover. That is because of my own manifest and grave defects as a draftsman, and I am sure that, if the principle of what I am arguing were accepted, somebody more competent than I could put the thing into form. In trade unions, ballots take place in all sorts of ways. The election of officers of what we in my union call a divisional council, but what in some other unions, such as the AUEW, is called a district committee, obviously takes place at a meeting of that council or of that committee. As said
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
at our Sitting last Tuesday by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), there are many different forms of institution within the trade union movement and it is not easy to find a form of words to cover them all. That is what I was trying to do. I have made the best fist of it that I can, but, I repeat that, if we can get acceptance of the principle, I am sure that someone else will be able to make a better job of the draft. Therefore, while warmly supporting the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend, I urge the Committee to support its extension in the way that I have indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider that the term "work-place" is a good one and should be put in. I think that is a helpful suggestion to the Government. After all, many individual work-places nowadays are larger than some unions. A great deal of publicity was recently given to the Leyland ballot. I should imagine that the Leyland work force is much larger than many individual trade unions, and therefore it would be helpful to the Government to have the word "work-place" inserted in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I assume that the Government want to encourage ballots. They think that ballots are good 
	<i>per se.</i> They believe that they should be encouraged and that they will have beneficial effects. I am in favour of ballots. My union conducts all its affairs by ballot. But I am not sure that the Government will get the benefits that they imagine they will get. I do not think that the holding of a ballot is quite the panacea that the Government hope it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no illusions about that. We have said so frequently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The experts in industrial relations in the Conservative party may have said that frequently, but their remarks have not always been heard by other hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we should not encourage the simplistic view that, for want of a better description, a mass of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
moderate members and a tiny group of extremist trade union general secretaries go round calling strikes at the drop of a hat, and that if only we could encourage ballots none of this would happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene when I have spoken at length myself, but there is a particular point here. Those Members on the Government Benches who take the view about which we have just heard and who, notwithstanding the views of their leaders, think that there is a magic wand in ballots, rely upon one thing. When decisions are made by ballot they are very often decisions made by the newspapers. When chaps who are voting do not go to meetings and do not hear the issues or, if it is the election of a person, do not know the candidates, the only way in which they can find out about such matters is by reading what the newspapers say. I have no doubt at all—without any reflection on the very worthy gentleman who was elected—that the election of the last president of the AUEW was decided by the newspapers. They pushed a candidate, and they pushed him hard. Another example was that ill-famed ballot of which I spoke in June 1975. That gross error, which was made by a majority of our people, which now seems to have dissipated into thin air, was made because all the newspapers were urging one course of action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the same point, we must be careful of going too far up the road that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) has taken because trade unionists are not all that easily led on all these occasions. He will certainly recall what happened when the previous Conservative Government had compulsory ballots and the railwaymen were called on to vote by ballot. It produced a result contrary to that which the government had both desired and expected. Therefore trade union members are not always easily led, although I think that there is a great deal in what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a feeling that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
was at an election meeting when the result of that ballot was declared. My memory may be deficient or wrong, but I believe that was under a previous Conservative Administration. I think that it was the first and only ballot they held, a compulsory one in that case, when the NUR was intending to call out its people and there was a pause. What was that pause called?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A cooling-off period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A cooling-off period. I believe that is an American importation. A cooling-off pause or period was ordained by the Government of the day, and during that period a compulsory ballot of the railwaymen was held. Instead of cooling them off, it seemed to heat them up and the ballot result was a resounding success for the union executive and a virgin defeat for the Government. The hon. and learned Gentleman may be letting a genie out of the bottle here that he might well come to regret. I do not know. I am in favour of ballots, but I think that he may well find that many of them will be rather unfortunate. What we are saying is that there should not only be postal ballots. Surely, other forms of balloting are equally valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is really the Minister's purpose to encourage more balloting throughout the trade union movement, he should not seek to force trade unions to alter their procedures. Each organisation has its own procedures, and to say that it must alter them by this particular method is likely to be unsuccessful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to point out that there is nothing in the clause which forces trade unions to adopt any method at all. It is wide open. The hon. Gentleman, to whose speech I am listening to with attention, is on a false point. It may shorten matters if I point that out. Every method is open under this clause, but of course the regulations permit the Secretary of State to restrict reimbursement to postal ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather under the impression from what the Secretary of State said that this was to be restricted to postal ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first instance, yes. Mr. Varley: My hon. Friend is quite
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
right. In the explanatory notes issued by the Government before the start of the Committee stage, it is stated that clause 1
	<br><blockquote><p>"…does not refer to postal ballots but the Government intends that the regulations will provide only for this type of ballot to be covered initially with power to bring in non-postal ballots later".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend is on a good point. He is suggesting that perhaps the Minister should start with workplace ballots rather than postal ballots if he wants a maximum turn out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point of our amendment. We say that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'ballot' means one that is conducted by postal or other methods.…</p></blockquote>
We want the words "other methods" to be written in. That is the point, which I hope the Under-Secretary will accept. He may want to encourage ballots. But I do not believe that they will be encouraged if he says, as I thought the Secretary of State had, that they are to be only postal ballots. It is unrealistic to expect unions to change their procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been made that other methods are equally valid. We have already talked about general elections. They are not conducted by postal ballot. May I illustrate the point that other organisations have their own procedures? We agree that the House of Commons is a democratic institution. The Under-Secretary is in office validly and democratically, yet he was not elected by a postal ballot. That is clear proof that there are other democratic and valid methods, and trade unions use methods other than postal ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), who is not here at present, talked about Greek democracy. I claim that our printing unions run things in a way largely analogous to ancient Greek democracy. In ancient Greece, units of local Government were restricted to 5,000. That was the number which an orator's voice could reach, and so everyone could have a say. That was direct democracy. At our workplaces we have meetings quarterly. Indeed, we have a problem in getting a hall in London big enough. The only one we can find is the Beaver Hall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
ber referred to the print unions. On the question of Greek democracy, I feel that the print unions are run more on a Spartan system of democracy than on an Athenian one. Speaking as a member of the SLADE union, I do not think that we should look too closely at the print unions in discussing ballots to get any great guidance on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always admired the Spartans and have always tried to be a Spartan myself, but I find the hours of work here becoming less and less spartan and more and more decadently Athenian. We go to great lengths to have the Athenian form of democracy in NATSOPA. On the newspaper for which I worked, in order to accommodate all our members, we fine them if they do not come, or if they miss three meetings we expel them—we had to pay £400 to hire the Beaver Hall, which is £1,600 per annum to hire Beaver Hall to allow our members Athenian democracy.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to restrict ourselves to a postal ballot, I am wondering how this would be done. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has explained how expensive it would be. It would amount to 24p per member, which is a great deal of money. Presumably someone would have to send out all the envelopes and obtain all the addresses. The individual chapels or districts of various unions would have the addresses. Are they all necessarily kept at head office? I would imagine that some unions would have difficulties in obtaining a complete, valid and up-to-date list. They would have to take on extra staff. All the envelopes would have to be addressed. The whole thing would be hideously expensive. If expense is no problem, if there is plenty of taxpayers' money for this, well and good, but I draw attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the principle of ballots and once again enter a couple of warning notes to those who think that this is a panacea. Let us take some more recent examples than 1974, for example, last winter when the then Labour Government were trying to have a 5 per cent norm. The first group of workers who rebelled were those at Fords. There was no question there of agitators stirring up the workers. They just walked out and the union leaders had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
to run very fast to try to keep up with them. I can think of other examples when we had docks in London and especially of a union whose officials were very moderate. It was precisely because they would not cause strikes when the work force thought that there were circumstances and grievances which justified strikes, that the workers themselves, without any instructions from their unions, arranged strikes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow is on to a good point when he makes the analogy that the suggestion here is that we run things by referendum. I looked up the Donovan report—presumably the experts—which, in its summing up, after considering all the arguments and looking at places where ballots are compulsory said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Experience in the USA has been that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action. This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory."</p></blockquote>
It also states that in certain provinces:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Once a vote has been taken and has gone in favour of strike action, the resulting stoppage may restrict the union leaders' freedom of action to stop the strike."</p></blockquote>
That appears on page 114, at the bottom of which it is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think it preferable that trade union leaders should bear, and be seen to bear, the responsibility of deciding when to call a strike and when to call it off."</p></blockquote>
There are grave dangers in taking away the power and responsibility of trade union leaders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read the next sentence. Mr. Leighton: The next sentence says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Occasions may of course arise when union leaders would themselves wish to hold such a ballot or are required to do so by their rules. The decision on such a matter should continue to rest with the unions."</p></blockquote>
The point I am trying to make is that we must be very careful of taking power away from the trade union leaders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us make another analogy with the Government. The Government are elected and the Government are elected and the Government Ministers and Secretaries of Stated bear the responsibilities. They do not run to the electorate with a postal ballot whenever a decision
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
is to be made. I suppose the analogy with a strike is when one goes to war. I cannot think of anything more drastic than that. Strikes normally last just a few weeks, and very rarely do people get killed. A war goes on for six years and millions of people get killed. When this country decided to declare war, as far as I know, the Prime Minister of the day bore the responsibility, made a speech and said that, unless he heard from a foreign government by 11 o'clock that morning, we would be at war. There was no question of holding a postal ballot of the electors as to whether they agreed with that or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are doing many things now. They are increasing VAT and prescription charges. One could think of a host of even more important things, but there is no question of the Government continually running to the electorate with postal ballots, and the same principle must apply in the trade unions. Anything which takes power away from the elected leaders is dangerous and should be resorted to very carefully. I put that point to the hon. and learned Gentleman because I think it is constructive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to say that I am strongly in favour of postal ballots where unions want to have them. I do not share some of the fears of my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) about postal ballots because they have the benefit of increasing participation. What the amendment says is that there are methods other than postal ballots which can lead to very high participation. For example, in the NUM pithead ballots, I understand that participation sometimes reaches 50 or 60 per cent. There seems to me to be a good case, therefore, for saying that this kind of balloting is something which ought to be covered by public funds if that is what the union wants. That is what the amendment says, and I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has faced up to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important amendment, but in an inferential sense rather than in any mandatory sense. As far as I can see, unless I am totally misreading the Bill the whole of clause 1 is permissive anyway. If the amendment were accepted, while not placing any new duty upon the Secretary of State, it would nevertheless be a clear
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
indication of the area within which it would be the wish of the House that he should operate. From that point of view, it is certainly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which I do not quite understand is why any Secretary of State should wish to deprive himself of this kind of additional area within which to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contrary to what the hon. and learned Gentleman said, he explicitly stated at our first sitting that postal ballots were what the Government had in mind and he specifically said that the kind of ballots referred to in our amendment are not what the Government have in mind and they will not finance them. If he is now backtracking on that, we shall be glad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a general sense, I should have thought that the Secretary of State would welcome an amendment of this kind which actually increases the field within which he is permitted to operate. Indeed, if I were the Secretary of State—which, thank the Lord, I am not—I should certainly welcome that additional power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a debate on an earlier amendment I asked what was the Government's objective in clause 1. While I was not given any very clear answer, I still assume that the purpose is to advance the cause of democracy. If that is so, again I must ask how the cause of democracy is retarded by an acceptance of this amendment. Why accept it? No reason has been given for the assumption that postal ballots are in some way superior to any other kind of ballot. What we shall get, if this is rejected and if the Secretary of State acts in the way we were told he would act, is unfair discrimination between one set of trade unions and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see a little more consistency on the part of the Government. When we were debating an amendment to strike out lines 15 and 16, the Government said that the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify"</p></blockquote>
must be left in subsection (3). The consistent with that, they should be happy to accept an amendment which includes the words "or other methods" I relation to bollots. Why do the Government insist on
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
retaining "such other purposes" in subsection (3) while not accepting other methods of conducting ballots?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, in accepting the principle of amendment No. 2 relating to officers who are paid and officers who are employees, has very properly destroyed the distinction inherent in the original Bill between paid and unpaid officers. The assurance he gave us about the amendment which he will produce at a later stage has wiped out what would have been very unfair discrimination. I am asking him to apply that same principle to the question of ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions are independent bodies and quite properly produce their own rules according to their own circumstances. In some cases it is more convenient and more expedient for them to ballot by post and in other cases to ballot in other ways. It is grossly unfair, in my view, to discriminate between unions which, for very good reasons, have postal ballots and those which have non-postal ballots. I still await a justification of such discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A type of ballot to which my hon. Friends have not, as far as I can recall, referred yet is the ballot, most importantly, conducted at the annual conference of the trade unions. Certainly in the case of the NUJ, officers of such importance as the president, the vice-president and the general treasurer are all elected by means of a secret ballot held in the conference itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why a trade union which finds it appropriate to do the job in that way should be denied the financial assistance from public funds which is to be available if it chooses to do it by post. It does not make sense. We are talking about a fundamental question of democracy—the right of a trade union to make its own rules without being discriminated against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) explain what he means by his intervention? Is he saying "What we wanted was to have postal ballots.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, we should. In reply to my hon. Friend, it appears to me that that was what the hon. Gentleman was saying. If he is, it is very unreasonable. Perhaps he will in due course enlarge upon that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate, to say the least, if the Secretary of State it to make a scheme which does not act fairly to the whole trade union movement. That is the burden of our argument on the amendment and on the amendment to the amendment. We are simply trying to achieve a degree of fairness as between one trade union and another. Because one trade union operates in a different way from another, it should not lose opportunities for public funds to be put into its system of elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Under-Secretary has not replied with the usual words that, subject to drafting and the usual caveats, he accepts the spirit of the amendment. One can only conclude that the Under-Secretary intends to resist both amendments. I find that surprising in view of the number of times that the Under-Secretary and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have assured the Committee, and myself in particular, that clause 1 is entirely permissive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already been accused on one or two occasions of becoming hysterical on the subject, but I have read the clause repeatedly and, though I accept that the failing is probably mine, I have not yet found the words, the subsection or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
lines which indicate that the clause is entirely permissive. No doubt, the hon. and learned Gentleman will point out to such a simpleton as myself which words in clause 1 indicate that it is permissive and that a subsequent Secretary of State could not change the rules. I fail to see why the Government should have difficulty in looking favourably on these amendments. This is one of the areas in which the Conservative Party has great difficulties. It assumes that, if only there are postal ballots, there will be democracy within the trade union movement and that the "moderates"—I put the word in inverted commas—will always win and the "extremists"—in inverted commas—will always be defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Tories appear to see it time after time, it is only the work of a handful of extremists who bring the trade union movement and the country so many problems, and if only they could get the silent majority off their backsides and get them to put pen to a piece of paper, all would be well. That may be a delusion of the Tory Party. I have the feeling that, irrespective of their eventually putting an Act on the statute book which will be called the Employment Act, they have some rude awakenings coming and no more than in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me try again to explain this business of the ballot. Although at times we seem to be discussing the affairs of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers rather more than other unions, I think that is bound to be so because of the experience that that union has in holding ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it moves, ballot it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. That is a good summing-up of my union's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great difficulty in this field, I beg hon. Members opposite to realise that, when one has a ballot for, let us say, the president, the general secretary or a member of the executive council or one of the national officers, or even one of the regional officers, of my union, one is covering a very large area, in some cases the whole of the country and in other cases an area where the union is divided into seven divisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great difficulties of the membership is that they may not know even one name on the ballot paper. That may be considered a deplorable state of affairs,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
but I am trying to point out the practical situation which exists. Many times I have seen ballot papers for one of the national positions in our union. There may be 20 names on the paper with brief details of age, the section of the union of which they are members and the number of years that they have been members of the union. On some occasions an election address is put out by some of the individuals standing for the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The members in South Lancashire may be aware of or know a candidate who comes from that area, but that may be as far as it goes. If someone is not one of the individuals who has held the office and is seeking re-election, or if the previous man has retired and it is an entirely new ballot and they are all new names and members from all over the country are standing for the position, it leads to great difficulties because members are in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not like a general election, as hon. Members opposite seem to think, where one has the Conservative, Labour, Liberal, and perhaps Communist and National Front candidates. The majority of us would be honest enough to admit that, when a general election is called and people vote, invariably they are voting for the party. No one would argue otherwise. It is not the individual. The individual's vote is very small. The vast majority of people in a general election are voting for the party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in a trade union ballot is not that at all. One is voting for the individual. One of the issues which used to give me cause for concern was when I was the branch teller of the Hebburn No. 2 branch of the AUEW. Invariably when the members were coming in and collecting their ballot papers to vote at the branch—I should point out that I was also the convenor at the large shipyard in the town and leader of the town council so I was a fairly well known personality within the AUEW in Hebburn—they used to ask me who they should vote for. I used to make the point "I am not allowed by rule to tell you who you should vote for. All I can do is say that I feel that I should support So-and-so, but you must express your own choice among the names on the ballot paper". They used to reply, in good commonsense working-class terms "We have not the faintest idea who any of them are, but we want to cast our vote".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why postal ballots are not the panacea, particularly for the election of
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
Officers that the Tory Party seems to think. A strong case can be made for elections to be held, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) have said, by a variety of ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument this morning in relation to the election of officers becomes much stronger in the other areas in which we are likely to have ballots. We shall then be talking about
	<br><blockquote><p>"obtaining a decision or ascertaining the views of members of a trade union as to the calling or ending of a strike or other industrial action."</p></blockquote>
I submit that if a group of men and women are involved in industrial action, with the best will in the world they will discuss that industrial action at their workplace. If they are talking about going on strike, they will talk about it at their workplace. They will want to hear the views of their shop stewards, their convenor and their local or regional trade union officers. If the Government suggest that they should go away and wait till they receive a ballot paper before they decide to go on strike, I suspect that the workers will think that the world had gone mad and that they should take a decision at the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support secret ballots. In all the years I was a convenor, I never liked the putting up of hands. There was a classic occasion recently where the workers were divided up and the "fors" were put in one field and the "againsts" were put in another field, to try to ensure that they had the majority of membership. I strongly suggest that this is an area in which a ballot to be held at the place of work would be the proper way to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said on a number of occasions in the Committee, some unions hold a postal ballot now at the pithead or at the place of work. Given the structure of many trade unions, again my own union is a good example where, in a town with a number of engineering industries, if the members come to the branch and make the decision within the branch it can cause a degree of friction, because the members who have a problem at one branch may be outnumbered by individuals who are not working at the same establishment. So a strong case can be made for matters which affect the workplace being discussed and balloted on in the workplace so that one obtains the views of the workers in that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of nothing likely to cause more disharmony and industrial problems than if workers not affected by the terms of the dispute are to start deciding whether the workers who are involved should take industrial action. That would be a recipe for disaster. In that context, I suggest that with regard to ballots at the workplace the Government—again with the necessary 
	<i>caveats abouts</i> about drafting, loose wording and so on—could accept the spirit of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, there is the question of amending the rules of a trade union, which is paragraph (
	<i>e</i>). Obviously, almost everything that happens in the National Union of Mineworkers is relevant to the mining industry. It is the classic case of all the workers in an industry being members of the one union. It seems to me common sense that they should be allowed to hold their ballots either at the pithead or at the branch. In most colliery areas the branch and the village are synonymous. They are at one with each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a union wants to amend its rules, under the terms of clause 1 it has to hold a postal ballot if it is to receive financial assistance, but if it does it by another equaly democratic method and it wants assistance, it cannot have it. There should be flexibility here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not refer at this stage to lines 15 and 16, but on the question of
	<br><blockquote><p>"obtaining a decision on amalgamation or transfer"</p></blockquote>
I am sure that both sides of the Committee and all sides of the trade union movement welcome the transfers and amalgamations which have taken place over the past 15 years and brought unions together. At an earlier sitting I referred to the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers and the difficulties that they had over a lengthy period when they brought five unions into one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that everyone welcomes and recognises the move towards amalgamations within the trade union movement. I do not know the actual figures, but if one takes the position at the end of the war and the position now, there has been a considerable increase in the membership of the trade union movement and at the same time a considerable reduction in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
number of trade unions because of the sensible amalgamations which have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you will allow me a brief second out of order, Mr. Goodhew, I should have thought that the Government would be wise to have a clause in the Bill which encouraged and made some finance available to trade unions which sought to amalgamate. However, we can return to that at a later stage. It is certainly something that must be encouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the-Government are offering money for balloting in amalgamation cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I am on that point now. I was referring not to the availability of money to ballot the membership but to the availability of finance to encourage mergers of trade unions. I risk going out of order, and you know, Mr. Good-hew, that it is not my desire at any time to stray beyond the bounds of order, so I shall return to that on a subsequent occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a tremendously important issue for the trade union movement, and I am pretty certain that I am right in saying that in all trade unions the question has to be put to the membership on the amalgamation of two or more trade unions. Indeed, if one studies the difficulites of the AUEW over the past seven years in trying to create a merger of the four sections of our union, TASS, the engineering section, the construction workers and the foundry section, one recognises that there are considerable difficulties in bringing organisations together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that is important, is to be welcomed and is to be encouraged, one would have expected that the Government to look at any opportunity to smooth the path of amalgamation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the terms and the reasons for a merger or amalgamation have to be fully explained to the membership. Contrary to a belief which seems to be widespread within the Tory Party, most trade union members take a pride in their individual trade union and there are considerable difficulties in persuading them that they should sink their identities into another trade union. As I have said, my own union with its four sections is a classic example of the difficulites one can have in trying to create one union out of the four.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it would be ideal to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
have an arrangement whereby it could be explained to the membership, not only in leaflet form but also by visits from the regional officers of the unions involved in the amalgamation, and then a ballot taking place at the workshop, a secret ballot, as we have at local and parliamentary elections—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, the hon. Gentleman was good enough to say that he would not wish to stray from order. I think that we are going a little wide of the amendments now when we start talking about amalgamation of trade unions, which is an entirely different subject from the one before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Goodhew, if I have transgressed. I thought I was in order in relation to paragraph (
	<i>e</i>), which refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"obtaining a decision in accordance with the Trade Union (Amalgamations, etc.) Act 1964 on a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation or transfer."</p></blockquote>
If I am out of order, I apologise sincerely. It was not wilful, Mr. Goodhew, I thought that the Point I was making about the holding of ballots at the place of work, branch or whatever other place was involved would be in order under paragraph (
	<i>e</i>). But I accept your ruling. I merely say that I think that the Under-Secretary should take note of the many fine points which have been made this morning by my right hon. and hon. Friends and recognise the value of what we are suggesting, since we also are anxious to secure the spirit of co-operation within the trade union movement. We are suggesting a very useful weapon to be at his disposal so that he will have within this permissive clause 1—the hon. and learned Gentleman will ask me where it tells me that it is permissive—a wide variety of means to spread the cause of democracy and participation. I hope that we have convinced the hon. and learned Gentleman that it is essential that he accepts the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably as well if I say a few words about my attitude to this amendment at this stage rather than wait until the Under-Secretary has replied, because he will no doubt take into account in that replay what I have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like all my hon. Friends, I am very
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
much in favour of secret ballots provided that they do not impinge on the autonomy of the trade unions. Naturally, we shall want to explore that further when we come to clause stand part, and look particularly at the role of the certification officer in devising the scheme, because we have not covered that on the amendments so far. That is crucial because, if there were any suggestion that the certification officer were to take over any of the activities of the trade union, we should want to know about it to test our attitudes or to come to an attitude about the whole of the provisions here. But, generally speaking, we are in favour of secret ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Under-Secretary will tell us that the clause does not exclude workplace ballots. But what has caused some alarm on this side of the Committee is the fact that he put it about—I have already referred to it, and so have my hon. Friends—that initially the ballots will be postal ballots and that perhaps non-postal ballots or workplace ballots will be brought in later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happen to prefer workplace ballots to postal ballots for three reasons. First, I think that they are much more effective. Secondly, there is the element of cost, now that the Government are to provide some money. Third, there is the speed, it being essential that these things are carried through quickly and decently while the issues are before those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I explain briefly what I mean by effectiveness, cost and speed. If there is a general belief that the more trade unionists participate in decision-taking the more sensible the result—it does not always work out like that—we have already proved that there is likely to be a bigger response from a workplace ballot than from a postal ballot. We cited, for example, the experience of the AUEW where a postal ballot obtains a 30 per cent response and secret ballot at the workplace in the National Union of Mineworkers is likely to get a 60 per cent or 70 per cent response. Sometimes democracy makes mistakes, but, generally speaking, if that wide participation can be obtained, it is much better because people exercise their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the National Union of Mineworkers, the trade union that I know best, ballots are conducted roughly on general election or local government lines. There is a check-off system. People collect their ballot papers from a central point, go to a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
polling booth, put their ballot papers in the box, and, in most cases, not for branch officials but certainly for strike action or for the election of national officers, the papers go to the Electoral Reform Society and are counted there. I do not think that the effectiveness of those ballots has ever been called into question. They produce some very good results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, only a few weeks ago the Government were utterly delighted that, as the result of a workplace ballot, the miners accepted 20 per cent. They had thought that they would reject it and that they would be resuming negotiations. The Government could not conceal their gratification that the miners, by a workplace ballot conducted on secret grounds, had accepted an increase of 20 per cent, because they had thought that they were in for a struggle. That is what I mean by effectiveness. It is much better to go for workplace ballots if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to cost, if postal ballots, for example, are the only ones that will be allowed initially and the Government estimate that it will cost £1 million in the first year or £2 million in a full year, that may prove to be an under-estimate. If 5 million trade unionists exercised their right every year, it would go up to a figure far in excess of £2 million. It could reach £10 million in a year. We are all interested in ensuring effective savings where savings can be made, and if the Government were to provide funds for workplace ballots, that, in my experience, would be less costly than postal ballots. There is the cost of printing for the postal ballot. One would then have to pay people, presumably, for time off work to conduct that ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that we do not want funds or that those trade unions who decide to take advantage of the provisions of this clause should not have funds for postal ballots. Not a bit of it. I am talking about the take-up, the effectiveness and the cost. That is a factor to which the under-Secretary should perhaps address his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of speed. How does one get these things done quickly? I do not want to be facetious, but yesterday Sir William Barlow, the Chair-
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
man of the Post Office Corporation, gave evidence to the Select Committee on Industry and Trade. He said that there is no doubt that the postal side will cost more and will not be as effective. He is probably right. It could not come from a better source. I deplore the fact that there should be a further deterioration in our postal services. One of the suggestions was that in tower blocks, for example, there should be a central collecting point instead of door-to-door deliveries. If such a system were adopted for ballots, it could undermine their speed and effectiveness. If one wants results quickly, it is much better to organise the printing of a secret ballot at the workplace in order to avoid the inevitably long delays that take place with postal ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the difficult matter of multi-unions. We have referred this morning to the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the National Union of Mineworkers—industrial trade unions. But what is much more common in British industry is that one has, say, the AUEW and the T & GWU. As I said at the first sitting of the Committee, that situation exists at Longbridge, an area represented by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jocelyn Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly true that it is much more complicated where there are multi-unions in a large factory such as Longbridge. The fact is that most people actually want secret ballots. One of the main reasons why I was elected in a motor industry constituency was for that very reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not denying any of that. I am only saying that if there is a demand for ballots of that kind within the motorcar industry it is far better that they should be conducted by the trade unions. The ballots that have been held so far in Leyland have been organised by the company. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) explained earlier in the Committee that once it is suggested that Governments are getting involved in ballots, or that companies are organising ballots, one perhaps gets the worst result of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had experience of that when National Industrial Relations Court in 1971 tried to impose a ballot on the railwaymen and we got a terrible result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
there are to be ballots, one must make sure that the trade unions conduct them and that they exercise their rights, presumably under this clause, to get some funds. I can envisage a situation at Long-bridge, and throughout the whole of BL, where the AUEW would want a ballot and the Transport and General Workers would not, or the other way round, or where ASTMS would want a ballot. It would be better at least not to exclude workplace ballots at this early stage. They could be organised much more effectively than a postal ballot. Postal ballots would need sorting out, because companies would have to be asked for names and addresses and that sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, let the Government think again about their commitment here, within the regulations which they have to provide under the clause, to provide money only for postal ballots in the first instance. I think they should keep an open mind on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend referred earlier to Sir William Barlow and to the evidence that he gave yesterday. I think he also gave evidence that the postal charges are about to go up. My right hon. Friend has already referred to the cost of postal ballots. It will be interesting to discover—perhaps we shall have to wait until the debate on clause stand part for this—whether the Government's figures so far take account of that increase in postal charges. It could make an appreciable difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could make an appreciable difference. On the basis of my own experience—I was appointed to teller in my early twenties at the pithead NUM ballots relating to a day's wages or something like that—I am convinced that if the postal services are to be allowed to deteriorate further and the costs to go up, then on the ground of cost alone I think the Government should not exclude workplace ballots right at the beginning. On the grounds of effectiveness, speed and cost, I think the Government should accept the amendment. The Under-Secretary will probably say that it is not necessary to pass this amendment, but I hope he will be able to tell us, when the regulations are brought before Parliament to set up the scheme, that workplace ballots as well as postal ballots will at least be eligible for Government funds right
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
from Day 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand why there is a resistance about accepting the two amendments. It has been said that workplace ballots are not entirely excluded, but surely there can be no objection to getting this definitely written into the Bill. That is the purpose of the amendments. My right hon. Friend has illustrated the fact that when postal ballots are held it takes a considerable time and it might be very much more effective if ballots could be taken at a workplace. The classic example is the one that was mentioned earlier, when the NUR called its members out on strike. Under the Industrial Relations Act, the previous Tory Government suggested that a ballot should be held. They fell flat on their face because to their consternation 90 per cent. of the members backed their leadership's demand for a strike. All that they succeeded in doing was to prolong that strike for three extra weeks while the ballot papers were sent out and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see that the postal ballot could be a very cumbersome weapon in trying to resolve industrial disputes. It does not take into account, for example, the number of spontaneous industrial disputes that take place in British industry today. I have in mind cases where a shop steward is victimised by the management and, quite spontaneously, the work force marches out of the factory. The present case of Mr. Derek Robinson is an example of what happens when a senior shop steward is sacked. The whole of the work force in Longbridge came out and only went back when the union asked it to because an inquiry was being held. That matter is by no means closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sort of thing often happens. It might happen, for example, when the management decides to speed up a conveyor belt and the people are so exasperated that they down tools immediately, march out and refuse to continue to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many instances where disputes start unofficially by some spontaneous action, generated in most instances by bad management. As a consequence, the trade unions are then faced with the question of having to give official recognition to the dispute. It seems to me that, in these circumstances, it would be better if the viewpoint of the work force could be ascertained by a ballot conducted inside the workplace. It would speed up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
negotiations, would ascertain what the workers really thought of the matter, and a decision could be reached in a very short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disregarding the cost of a postal ballot at the moment, but postal charges are going up early next month, as a consequence of which it will cost a tremendous amount, apart from the time factor in ascertaining the opinions of workers. So it seems to me sensible to spell out in the Bill a proviso that ballots at workplaces and by other methods should not be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to ascertain the motivation behind the desire of the Government to stick, initially at any rate, to postal ballots. They may well think that, if ballots are taken in a workplace the individual trade unionists may be influenced by their mates and colleagues—they talk together in the canteen and at the work bench, one influences another, and possibly they get to know more about the dispute, are better informed about it and are more likely to take industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government spokesmen may have in mind that it would be more cosy to send a ballot form to a trade union member's house, because, when he is away from his work mates, when he has to contemplate the need to meet his bills, increases in rates, increases in mortgage payments, increases in prescription charges, increases in charges for school meals, and transport, increased bank charges, and the possible threat, which is apparent to trade bank charges, and the possible threat, which is apparent to trade unionists, of the view held by influential members of the Conservative Party to take away social security payments from the wives and children of strikers, all this might influence him within the walls of his own home to say, "Can I afford to go out on strike?"
That may be the motivation of trying to confine ballots to people at home by post instead of their being held at the workplace where people have the opportunity of discussing the issues at stake with their colleagues and arriving at a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps to add to what hon. Members opposite think are the attractions of a worker considering the ballot while he is sitting in his own house there is the fact that, while he is thinking about those increased burdens he has to
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
bear as a result of having a new Government, he has on the table in front of him one or two daily papers which are pushing one particular candidature. That, too, might exercise and influence. He has on his table one or two daily papers which, on the whole make an awful mess of their own industrial relations but nevertheless have the brass neck to tell everybody else how to run industrial relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend that the press exerts an influence in addition to the influences of higher living costs and so on. But trade unionists learn from their own experience. A typical example can be found in the steel industry, where we have a moderate union—never had a strike since 1926—and in fact the living standards have fallen because it was not so militant. But many of us have met the steel workers and we know that they are now the most militant sector in the British working class. They will fight and fight and fight again. For their management to expect them to go back with increased productivity when they are embittered at the derisory initial offer of a 2 per cent. increase to meet increased charges of 17½ per cent., when they have been asked to accept a reduction in their living standards of about 15 per cent.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not go round the whole lot of possible grievances which might come into a trade unionist's life. If he will stick to the amendment it will help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always try to keep in order, Mr. Goodhew. I am endeavouring to illustrate that all these thoughts are in the mind of the individual when he is called upon to vote. As a consequence, because of the tremendous impact of the press, as my hon. Friend has said, and the impact of increased charges and so on, a man might well decide in a postal ballot that he cannot afford to come out on strike. Therefore it might suit the Government's book to allow him a reflective period at home to decide the issues rather than have ballots taken at the workplace. This is the only reason I can suggest to account for the strange exclusion of reference to workplace ballots in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to have an assurance that it is not excluded at some stage, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
there can be no objection to saying that there are other methods than the postal ballot. There is the workplace ballot and ballots at divisional or regional level for officers and so on. The Government must have some feasible method of deciding why one is better than another. I shall be interested to hear the Government spokesman set out in detail why he is objecting so strongly to mentioning specifically, as our amendments do, other methods and ballots at workplaces. It seems to me that there must be some ulterior motive. Otherwise, I cannot understand why there can be any objection. We could have a manuscript amendment to write into the Bill what we are assured is the Government's intention anyway, so that we know where we stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe in ascertaining by secret ballot the views of work people—and not only of work people. I should like to see the Government do something about ascertaining the views of shareholders in the companies that give contributions to the Tory Party, for example. Let us widen democracy and let all sections of all our population take part in the control of their own future. I believe in this type of democracy, but it has to be spelt out that there are many ways of achieving results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these words are incorporated in the Bill, they will help trade unionists to meet the desired end, which is to have the democratic opinion of work people known and acted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider very carefully what has been said and give us an assurance that these words will be incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the numerous points made by right hon. Gentleman and hon. Gentlemen and those in short interventions by my hon. friends. There are two reasons for the Governments inability to accept these amendments. The first is that they are in any event unnecessary. The second is that they may give rise to implications for the construction of the clause as a whole which the Government would not intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the first reason, I at once explain that the clause is permissive in its effect. The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) asked me to spell that out. I turn to that task. All that is needed is to look
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
at subsections (1) and (5). Subsection (1) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations make a scheme…".</p></blockquote>
We know by now, from our study of the clause, what the scheme is about. Subsection (5) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The circumstances in which and the conditions subject to which payments may be made under the scheme, and the amounts of the payments, shall be such as may be prescribed by or determined in accordance with the scheme"—</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In simple language, the Secretary of State can, if he wishes—though he does not have to—make a scheme whereby unions which have held certain ballots may be reimbursed for what it has cost them, or for part of what it has cost them. The types of ballot which may be eligible are set out in subsection (3), on which we spent a great deal of time at the last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Secretary of State does not have to make a scheme at all. If he does, it does not have to be a scheme which embraces all of them. He may make a scheme which embraces only one of these purposes. The only requirement is that such scheme as he does make shall be for a ballot that is secret. That is provided in subsection (5). That is why the marginal note reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments in respect of secret ballots".</p></blockquote>
Where ballots are held, the method by which they are held is completely open, provided that they are secret. They can be postal, they can be at workplaces, or at any of the places that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) would like to see included and has set out in his amendment (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore not necessary to make either of these amendments to enable the Secretary of State to make a scheme which will provide reimbursement for unions which have held ballots at the work place. That is a fundamental point. I criticise no one for difficulties in finding the way through legal drafting. I say that with no criticism of the draftsmen. Those of us whose job it is to be able to find our way through these things often make mistakes. But that point is fundamental to the whole understanding of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not simply rest on that, however. There is the further objection that the amendment could give rise to an implication which would not be consistent with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
the Government's present intention. It is that a general definition which would apply to the words "such ballots" in subsection (1)—the definition which is sought to be made in these two amendments—might provide a basis on which the courts could hold that, as the whole clause relates to ballots as so defined, that is, ballots conducted by postal or non-postal methods, the Secretary of State did not have power to exclude non-postal ballots from the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That implication might arise. The courts, we are advised, might come to that conclusion. Whether they would is not for us to say. For that warning to be raised, however, is enough to justify resisting this amendment, albeit that it is an unnecessary amendment in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that gives rise to the questioning which has perfectly properly been directed to the Secretary of State's present intention not to include ballots at the workplace but to restrict reimbursement under the scheme he proposes at present to draw up to postal ballots only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite properly, a lot of time has been devoted to that in this debate. It arises, I observe perhaps a little ruefully, from the disclosure or the making available to the Committee of the explanatory notes. I do not regret it because I think that it is helpful and sensible in deliberations on a complex matter for the Government to set out and make available what they at any rate think the clause means. A consequence of that is that we said, because we thought it a helpful thing to do, that at the moment we are proposing that the first scheme shall be restricted in this way. I shall explain why in a moment, but that is what has really given rise to about nine-tenths of this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman address himself to what appears to me to be an inconsistency in what he is saying? If he is saying that the Government cannot accept the phrase "postal or other methods" because they fear that a court might later rule that the Secretary of State was not acting properly by excluding one of the other methods, does the same principle not apply to the purposes provided for in clause 1(3), and has he not just told the Committee that the Secretary of State may include one or more or all of the purposes specified in that subsection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
If what he is saying about postal or other methods is right, or the Government's fear about that is right, should the Government not equally fear that if the Secretary of State excludes (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>), (
	<i>c</i>), (
	<i>d</i>) or (
	<i>e</i>) from the purposes he will similarly be found at fault by the courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power expressed in
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify"</p></blockquote>
enables the Secretary of State to place an order before Parliament enlarging the list of eligible ballots at present in subsection (3). That is a widening power, subject to Parliamentary approval. But we are advised that if a ballot is made subject to this definition, if the Secretary of State should wish to make a scheme which applies only to postal ballots, it might give rise to the argument, and one would wish to avoid it, that he was acting in a way that was not permitted by the wording of the clause as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that that would be a well founded argument, but it is one which any Government are wise to avoid, because we want to achieve certainty, and particularly in a case where it is unnecessary to give rise to that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member --> 
	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the hon. Gentlemen's point in a moment. The real debate has turned upon whether the Government ought to restrict the scheme to postal ballots only. I re-emphasise that it is open to the Government, if they wish to do so, to extend the scheme or to make the scheme by regulation one which will apply to reimbursing for ballots at workplaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasoning for the initial intention to restrict is this. First, as I have explained before, this is a new venture, one of which none of us has any experience, and the Government propose—and think it better—to proceed one step at a time. Second, the expenses of a postal ballot are likely to be much greater for a union than the expenses of a workplace ballot. We intend to provide help in the first instance where it is most needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, as the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) said, it was his intention that the scheme should not be limited to workplaces only but should apply to workplaces and postal ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
We are subject to financial stringencies which everybody knows about If we were to extend it to workplace ballots as well as to postal ballots, it would cost an uncertain but possibly a considerable amount more. That might well be so, because some would call for postal ballots and some would call for workplace bollots and some would call for workplace ballots. So that is another consideration
A further consideration is that special rules would almost certainly have to be drawn up to govern the conduct of workplace ballots. There is greater difficulty in ensuring and monitoring secrecy at a workplace ballot. We want to see how we go on. I absolutely agree with most of what has been said about the efficacy of workplace ballots, and I acknowledge the point fairly made by the right hon. Gentleman about the NUM ballot taken at the pithead. Of course I agree with that. It is not our intention to seek to denigrate the validity of workplace ballots at all that leads us, in the first instance, to have this intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened to and shall consider all the points that have made and take them into account when drawing up the scheme in the first instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for talking in plain commonsense language, as I asked him to do. The only snag is that I have not the faintest idea what he is talking about, and I shall read with great interest the reply that he is giving so that even somebody as stupid as myself can actually understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on one specific point the Minister is arguing that the reason for restricting this at this stage to postal ballots, postal ballots being much more expensive than workplace ballots, is that it is the Government's intention to channel money into the area where it is needed most. Those were his words. Will the Minister tell the Committee how many trade unions have written to the Secretary of State pleading for assistance to hold ballots?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I know of any trade union that has done that. But we know from more than one opinion poll, and most recently that of the Opinion Research Centre, published in 
	<i>The Times</i> a week or 10 days ago, that the provisions of the Bill regarding—[
	<i>Interruption</i>]. I had hoped to be allowed to answer a question which was asked when I gave
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
way. The provisions of the Bill regarding finance for ballots were supported by an overwhelming majority of trade union members. It just may be that there is here a discrepancy between the opinions of those who form the rank and file of the membership and at any rate the ostensible or expressed opinions of those who are in the leadership. We do not know, and I suspect that I should be out of order in pursuing that further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reason. We make clear in the explanatory note that by no means do we seek to exclude the possibility that the scheme will be amended to bring in workplace ballots. As I said at our first sitting, there is a powerful argument which can be mounted for extending it to workplace ballots. But the Government's view at the moment is that we ought to start as I have indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that there was from most right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite an expression of support for ballots. The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) and his right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield have made clear that they have always supported secret ballots, as many did, hon. Gentlemen's including the hon. Member for Newton. I did not think that I could follow the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) into his classical and Athenian allusions. Nor could I really support the view which I think he was advancing, that somebody who did not take an active part in his union affairs, did not turn up, did not play a part in union affairs, was somehow less entitled than the activist was to the consideration of Parliament when it was arranging electoral systems. In fact, he went so far as to say that he did not have a right to a say-so equal to that enjoyed by an activist. If one extends that to a general election, one will very soon be saying that nobody who is not a member of a political party ought to have a vote in a general election. I would not want it to be thought that we go down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to extend the right to vote in a general election to everybody, if he is not aged or infirm, who will take the trouble to walk to a polling station.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am all in favour of activity, but what divides us is this.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman really suggesting that the 20 to 30 per cent of the electorate who could not get off their backsides to vote at the last general election should have been sent postal votes.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction between what is practical and what is in every respect desirable. All of us who are democrats would agree that it is desirable that everybody who would be affected by a decision should have the right to take part, and should be assisted to take part, within the limits of what is practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then I was asked—I come back to the point—whether there was any consistency between my acceptance in principle of amendment No. 2 which we discussed last time, which enlarges the clause from employee to office-holder, and my resistance to this amendment. The difference is that amendment No. 2 would govern the scope of the regulations that could be made, that is to say, unless it were so enlarged the Secretary of State could not have made a scheme that would have permitted reimbursement for a ballot that was for the election of an office-holder who was not an employee. That was a widening amendment and I was happy to accept that in principle, subject to the reservations that I made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this amendment will have no effect because the scope of the regulations here will be unlimited. It is not limited by the clause, for the reasons I have given. I am sorry that I have not made it clear to the hon. Member for Newton. He does not do himself justice in speaking with such denigration of his own intellect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have, albeit it in about one-fiftieth of the time that has been taken up by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen's opposite, dealt adequately with the point that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked a question about the estimated cost of this proposal and whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
the Government had taken into account the increased charges about which we have all regrettably learned in the last day or two. The answer to that is "No". There will be an additional element. It is not at all easy to estimate, but an additional cost will be imposed by the postal charges increases when they take place. We have done our best to take sensible soundings from the Electoral Reform Society as to the likely cost of the scheme, taking account of current costs and of that society's extensive experience. It is the best guesstimate that it can make, and we are prepared to adopt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that I have been able to explain why the Government are not able to accept the amendments, while making quite plain that the door is not closed to, at some stage, reimbursement being available for ballots at the workplace. I hope that it may now be possible for us to vote on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, because I share your feeling, Mr. Goodhew, and certainly that of the Under-Secretary that we should reach a decision on these amendments before the Committee adjourns at one o'clock. I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman will be surprised when I say that I am disappointed by his reply. I think that my hon. Friends share that disappointment.

I am not prepared to countenance or discuss the technical points that the Under-Secretary made. We all recognise that essentially our debates are about amendments, policy and substance rather than the form, and the Government, if they accept the argument and the logic of the argument, can make all the necessary changes. We would accept that, and we certainly do not press the wording in the particular form of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point at which I started this morning. The amendment and the whole of this debate was triggered by the hon. and learned Gentleman's observations at our first sitting which gave the impression that the Government were not enthusiastic, to put it at best, about the idea of workplace ballots. The hon. and learned Gentleman has only further confirmed our assumption this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from addressing himself to our arguments, the hon. and learned Gentleman has given even greater emphasis to the point he made then. Certainly, we understand that the Minister can make a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
scheme that would include provision for workplace ballots, and we know that he still retains the power to determine and lay before Parliament the form of the scheme, irrespective of the scope that we give him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister makes the point that we give him endless scope even if he does not wish to take advantage of it. We are arguing to persuade him that he should take advantage of the scope that is offered to make provision for workplace ballots. He triggered off yet a new fear. I promise, Mr. Goodhew, that I shall not pursue it this morning, but he further alarmed me when he said that one objection that the Government saw at this stage to the making of provision for work place ballots is that it would entail making special rules to govern their conduct. I started to wonder what the certification officer would be required to lay down as conditions and what strings would be attached before the money was paid out. However, I do not want to pursue that as time is moving on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed. The hon. and learned Gentleman did not say, "The amendment is unnecessary. We have the power to do this under the clause as it stands, and if the Opposition will withdraw their</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>amendment, I give them an assurance"—and so on. It is perfectly open to argue that workplace ballots should be put on a par with any other kind of ballot. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had said "yes, we accept your argument and we shall make provision within the scheme", it would not have been necessary for us to press the amendment. I am sure that I could have persuaded my hon. Friends that his assurances were sufficient.</p>

	<p>But the hon. and learned Gentleman has made clear that he is not prepared to give that assurance and has argued against provision for workplace ballots, with all the inequities and practical difficulties for the unions that will ensue from that. The Government have failed to recognise the realities of the circumstances in which these matters are determined at the workplace and within the industrial relations field. For those reasons, I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote in support of the amendment.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed, and that is underlined by the fact that the Government have already acknowledged that they will have to come back on Report, having accepted in principle two of our amendments, because they could see merit in them. We are grateful to the Under-Secretary for responding in that way, but it underlines the practical difficulties which may well be encountered not only in the passage of the legislation but subsequently, and I shall not touch on some of those practical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet heard enough to allay the genuine and grave suspicions that are abroad, particularly within the trade union movement, on this question. I said earlier that we saw this initial clause on the matter of State aid for ballots as the sugar coating on a very bitter pill. I, for one, certainly take that view. Can I say to the hon. and learned Gentleman that last night I attended, in my constituency, a trade union delegate conference, called by the Islington trades council. [An hon. Member: "I read about it."] The hon. Gentleman can have read only a little of what I said, because most of my remarks were not devoted to the subject of Mr. Arthur Scargill; I mentioned him only in a passing reference. Most of my remarks were devoted to the somewhat obnoxious content of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I tried to help the Government by pointing out that in the matter of ballots—and the matter of ballots occupied a good deal of time during my discussions—it is in the end up to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
unions. It is a voluntary decisions. If they do not want the money they do not have to take it. But that, I can only say that there was a total lack of enthusiasm, and a large number of trade unions were represented. I would not say that it was hostility to State aid that was the problem. The problem was really the feeling that there was a grave danger that this would lead on to other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That worry is a matter for the Government. They must somehow dispel the anxiety that the State funding of ballots may turn the unions into the sort of tame tabby cat which I suspect the Prime Minister would like to see, or, if that does not turn out to be the case, that this aspect of the legislation may pave the way for compulsion. I cannot honestly say, having listened to the hon. and learned Gentleman the other morning, that I am satisfied that in the end the Government would not be prepared to go up that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman shakes his head. I understand that he put his hand on his heart, as it were, and came as near as possible to saying that he personally would not favour that course of action, but one has to point out—it has been pointed out before in this Committee—that a Conservative Government have gone all the way up that road before, with pretty disastrous consequences—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
