	<div class='title'>FEES FOR GRANT OF LICENCES, ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Amendment No. 262 moved [	<i>This day</i>], in page 29, line 5, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"In prescribing fees under the provisions of this section the Minister shall in general seek to recoup approximately the cost involved in providing the services required for the purposes for which the fees are prescribed."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before lunch we were questioning how far the clause should provide for the collection of a series of fees for the issue of documents, without any guidance on the policy to be pursued by the Minister in formulating the regulations controlling the level of fees. Consideration has been given by the Minister, and those in the industry responsible for finding the fees, on how far the industry should bear the cost of this part of the Department of Transport's work. They have considered whether it should be in part a public service—as some of the issues involved are clearly in the broader public interest—whether it should be seen as a legitimate expense to be passed on and how far the role of the Department is to regulate and control the affairs of those businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment takes a neutral stance on the cost argument. It will aid the Minister to the extent that he will have protection for any regulations that he makes which recoup the cost of providing the services directly required for the provision of documents. He would be hampered if he sought to use his power to obtain fees as a form of revenue raising for his Department. I do not suggest that he would try to raise revenue for any other Department or to improve his own standard of living. I hope that the amendment will give us an opportunity to consider this difficult issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not agree with the way in which the amendment is drafted but I hope that he will indicate his view on the principle. It would be useful if he
	<span class='label label-info column'>1484</span>
could tell us the current position in his Department and how far it is a cost upon public funds to administer these services, or the nearest equivalent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to amendment No. 263, which could be held to take a position slightly different from that of No. 262, if the two are read narrowly. Amendment No. 262 contains the word "approximately", and it can be interpreted as providing the total fees charged or the total costs incurred. If we read it broadly it meets the principle. But amendment No. 263 relates only to the operators' licences. It enunciates the principle that the charge should be proportionate to the maximum number of vehicles that can be operated under the licence. An operator seeking a licence to operate 50 vehicles would expect to be charged twice as much as an operator seeking a permit to operate a maximum of 25 vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle will appeal to Government Members in so far as it will mean that the small operators—and Conservatives claim to be protagonists for the small businessman—will be relieved to some extent by this charging system while the large operators will bear the heaviest financial load. That does not cause any difficulty in the Opposition's view. We like the principle of the broadest shoulders carrying the heaviest loads. There is a further attraction in that it will be a deterrent to those operators who might, as the Bill at present stands, be tempted to apply for an operator's licence for a considerably larger number of vehicles than in their current fleets. There is nothing whatsoever in the Bill to prevent them doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister thought about this? It is a slightly different provision from anything in present legislation. The Committee voted against clause 23 which provided for the transferable discs to be run by the operators. Now the operator's licence is the main guide to how many vehicles a PSV operator can run legitimately. It will not necessarily correspond with his number of vehicles. If it fails to correspond because he is running fewer vehicles, it will be legal but if it fails to correspond because he is running more vehicles, it will be illegal. This is an issue, therefore, of some importance. However, there is virtue in having a slight financial deterrent indicated by Parliament to the obtaining of an operational licence for a number of vehicles way in excess currently at the command of the operator—or the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1485</span>
number which he shows to the commissioners to whom he applies—because they might not be exactly the same. I do not want to join my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) in using the transport business to give cowboys a bad name—because cowboys were among my early heroes—but I have to take account that different operators may approach this issue differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues are bound up in the second amendment, both of which are worthy of consideration by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 264 deals with the method by which the regulations are made. I have a direct question for the Parliamentary Secretary. Does section 260 of the 1960 Act apply to this clause? I have read and re-read section 260 of the 1960 Act—I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the copy that I am using. That appears to indicate that any power conferred by the 1960 Act upon the Minister to make regulations must be exercised by statutory instrument. Parts of the Bill will become part III of the I960 Act, but no distinction appears to be drawn in the 1960 Act between one part and another. Section 260 will probably apply. If that is so, it seems that without the action suggested in this amendment, there will still be Parliamentary procedure in that the regulations will be prescribed in the statutory instrument. They will be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes to change that in two ways. It proposes to make it subject only to the control of the Commons. To that extent it seeks to simplify the procedure. It also proposes to make it subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and to that extent a stiffer hurdle has to be jumped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue before this Committee, which has for some weeks been looking in great detail at the powers which are to be exercised by a Minister if the Bill becomes an Act, that there are a large number of powers in the Bill to be exercised by the making of regulations. Even we, who understand with our detailed scrutiny of the Bill, the case that might be made for these enabling powers, and for leaving many matters undecided by the Bill to be decided by regulations, might have trouble in explaining that to our constituents, who want answers to their questions. We might
	<span class='label label-info column'>1486</span>
find it difficult to explain that, in our judgment, it is right to leave it to a Minister to deal with the matter by regulations as and when the occasion arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Gentlemen are with me so far, I put a second point to them. Constituents will ask: "What control will there be when the Minister makes the regulations? Will he have the opportunity to raise the matter directly with the Minister on the Floor of the House if there is something fundamentally objectionable in the proposal?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way that we can answer that question in the affirmative is by carrying the amendment. That is the only simple and direct way of dealing with the matter. I do not suggest that the Minister has any wrong intent in his use of these powers. Far from it. I appreciate the modern argument for delegated legislation and why so many Acts are on the statute book, put there quite recently, which make sweeping enabling provisions. But I believe there comes a time when every Committee has to make a choice between whether it wants the power to be vested in the Minister with no parliamentary control, whether it wants power to be vested in the Minister subject to his merely making the information available in the form of the regulations, or whether it wants to retain a degree of parliamentary control over some of the regulation-making powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a simple proposition on which to test that choice. In the clause, a whole series of possibly heavy new fees are involved for a number of people operating in this business. If the Minister lays before the House a perfectly satisfactory set of regulations, I am sure that none of us will challenge them. The affirmation will be obtained on the nod. But if serious difficulties or questions of policy are raised about those regulations, I think it is right for the Minister to be questioned and to give his answers, and for the House to decide ultimately. Those are some of the main issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can look broadly at the policy for financing the fee-raising arrangement and see how far the Minister wishes to have this enormous flexibility. In particular, if the Minister uses the power to introduce payment by instalments to the hilt—one might say licensing on the "never-never"—it should, on the first occasion be examined in a way that gives an opportunity for parliamentary challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0809">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1487</span>
Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) has raised one difficulty with the system of charging which the Minister did not anticipate. I read the clause a few times, and I did not anticipate it. Further difficulties may come to light if such a detailed instrument, covering such a range of charges, is laid before the House subject to affirmation. If that happens, it will be all to the good. The Opposition are not arguing that all legislation should be perfect, that there should be no enabling powers or that the legislation must define precisely every legal requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying that if a Minister take enabling powers on this scale, he should be answerable for them. The House of Commons exercises such powers in a reasonable way. I do not believe that any Minister has been unduly hampered by that procedure in the exercise of proper powers conferred on him by the House. It is a valuable procedure. This is an appropriate time to discuss whether we should substitute it for the powers provided in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are detailed amendments about the fees system. If any hon. Member has general points to make about fees they are probably best left until the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 262 seeks to impose a statutory obligation on the Minister to set the level of fees at a level that will
	<br><blockquote><p>"in general seek to recoup the approximate cost involved in providing the services."</p></blockquote>
I accept that this is a probing amendment, but it is vague in its wording and would be vague in its effect. It is also not entirely clear whether the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) is suggesting that each fee should seek to recoup the cost of providing the service for that particular form of licence, or whether the fee system as a whole should seek to recoup the whole cost. However, the amendment gives me an opportunity to give a general description of what we have to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the fees will have to be reassessed in the light of the changes that the Bill makes. It may help if I explain the basis on which the present fees system operates. We do not intend to move too far from that. Fees are at present fixed at a level which fully recoups the cost of the system, including
	<span class='label label-info column'>1488</span>
the salaries of enforcement staff and headquarters costs. But there is considerable cross-subsidisation from one service to another. For example, the cost of road service licensing and enforcement is far from covered by the fees charged for that part of the system. PSV driving tests are provided free. Both those services are cross-subsidised from the fees which are receifed from the public service vehicle licence. The system as a whole is entirely covered by the fees raised for various types of licence, but there is substantial cross-subsidisation within the system. Given that we shall no longer have PSV licensing, which is the main source of revenue, we shall have to reassess the whole system, including the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main changes will be that PSV licences will go, and fewer services of all kinds will require road service licences. There will be no conductor licensing because we agreed in Committee this morning to abolish it. The duration of various licences will be extended. We are taking power to charge for PSV driving tests. Operator licensing will come in, and we shall have to look to that as a source of revenue to replace PSV licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose—and I hope that the Committee agrees that it is the right way to proceed—to consult as widely as possible on a new fee schedule that the Department is in the process of drawing up. I doubt whether, in the end, we shall go for a system where we try to recover the exact cost of each type of licence. I anticipate that we shall seek to recover the costs of the system from those applying for and obtaining the licences. We hope to aim at rough equity at least in the differing charges between the size of operator and the particular benefit he receives from the licence for which he is applying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to amendment No. 263 which seeks to limit the broad d'scretion in clause 30 by ensuring that we fix a fee for a PSV operator's licence in proportion to the maximum number of vehicles it allows to be operated. I agree entirely with the broad aim of the amendment. It seems fair that in applying for an operator's licence, the operator with a large number of vehicles should be expected to pay a much larger fee overall than the operator who has only one or two vehicles. That would be reproducing one of the present features of the PSV licence.
Whether the amendment is the right way of achieving that is somewhat doubtful.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1489</span>
The snag with the amendment is that it would tie us in each individual case to levy fees for operators' licences exactly in proportion to the number of vehicles in that licence. It might be administratively simpler to have differing levels of fee for differing sizes of operation. Thus the fees would go up in steps. I am not yet familiar with the work being done on this matter, but there might be a particular level of fee of people with from one to 10 vehicles, another for 10 to 20 vehicles, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as drafted gives us the necessary discretion to vary the operator's licence fee according to the size of the operation. That is the way we intend to use the discretion, but we should leave more flexibility than the amendment would leave to the eventual regulations that would draft the schedule of fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third amendment—No. 264—seeks to require that when finally we produce a schedule of fees, following full consultation, it should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure requiring debate on the Floor of the House in each case. The present position was rightly described by the right hon. Member and is retained in the Bill. The regulation-making power will be subject to section 260 of the 1960 Act. That Act is now over 19 years old and its provisions are such that all regulations made under it follow the negative resolution procedure. That means that they are still debatable by the House and can be annulled by a vote of Parliament. But it is necessary for a prayer to be tabled and for time to be given before that debate can take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some regulations are of such importance that it is right that the main legislation should make it essential to have an affirmative vote in each case. But I do not think that our parliamentary colleagues would thank us if we put the schedule of fees for vehicle licensing into such a category. If the amendment were carried, it would mean that every time there was any variation in the fees level for any kind of vehicle licence we would have to take parliamentary time to debate it. In practice it might be a formality because such orders might go through on the nod late at night and cause little interference. But we do not, on the whole, litter up the Order Paper with that kind of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that—given inflation and given the need to respond to representations from the industry or to changed cir-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1490</span>
cumstances as the licensing system evolves—it is better to leave the situation flexible. Regulations should be tabled as statutory instruments subject to the negative resolution procedure so that only those that are most controversial can be brought before the House and annulled if they are not able to command a parliamentary majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my response to the three amendments. I do not think there is much difference between what the right hon. Gentleman wants and what we aim at. We intend that there will be different levels of fee for operations of different sizes. We intend that the total amount recovered as fees should cover the cost of the service, so that no charge on public funds will arise. We think that Parliament's rights will be adequately protected by the retention of the negative resolution procedure which has been followed for all regulations under the 1960 Act. I hope that I have made our intentions clearer and that the right hon. Gentleman will now feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be very reluctant to withdraw the amendment on the basis of the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary. I shall tackle some of the more obvious weaknesses in his argument, and shall deal first with amendment No. 263. The amendment clearly states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fees charged for PSV vehicle operator licences shall be approximately proportional"</p></blockquote>
to the number of vehicles. The amendment would not therefore stop any staging of fees. There could be one fee for up to 10 vehicles and another for 10 to 20. Those fees would still be approximately proportional to numbers of vehicles. I do not think that the amendment would have the effect the Parliamentary Secretary claims it would have. I think that it would be a guide that was acceptable on the basis of the Parliamentary Secretary's own judgment, in so far as there is a principle involved. The Parliamentary Secretary is not averse in principle to the idea of the larger-scale operator carrying the larger fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 262 makes provision:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to recoup approximately the cost involved in providing the services"—</p></blockquote>
not the cost of each individual service. It can be read as having the wider meaning. I do not feel that the Parliamentary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1491</span>
Secretary made much of a case against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn to the more contentious issue of the control mechanism—the affirmative resolution procedure—raised in amendment No. 264. What the Parliamentary Secretary has said does not bear out his fears and worries about the procedure. I have a greater respect than the Parliamentary Secretary for the form of the statutory instrument. I shall turn later to the question whether it will be the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend who will produce it. I would not think of statutory instruments as littering the Order Paper. This is an important issue. It affects a number of people very directly. It will determine their operating costs, their procedures of payment, and a number of other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary says that if we want a debate we have only to table a prayer. In that case, I cannot see that there is any difference, except in the time at which the debate can be held. With the affirmative resolution procedure the Government have rather more flexibility as to the time at which the debate takes place than with the negative resolution procedure. With a prayer, the debate must be held between 10 and 11.30 at night. With the affirmative resolution procedure, it may be held in any hour and a half of Government time. The affirmative resolution procedure gives the Government more flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit that my intention was not to give the Government greater flexibility, but to ensure—given the difficulties we have experienced in the House in connection with prayers—that if we wanted to query this issue we could do so effectively within a timescale which would make our decision realistic. Unfortunately prayers have been taken out of time. In those cases the facility for a debate has been provided, but there has been no facility for the House to exercise the control which was clearly intended by the House when it passed the legislation providing for control by annulment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me reassure the Minister on the question of difficulties in dealing with instruments. We now have a procedure for sending statutory instruments to merits Committees. It has been used with a lot of success when hon. Members merely want to question Ministers about the provisions of any statutory instruments. The procedure does not stand in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1492</span>
the way of sending these instruments upstairs to a merits Committee. It does not take Government time on the Floor of the House. It enables those hon. Members who are interested to attend a merits Committee and deal with questions on the instruments. So I foresee no difficulty there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a point of detail. The Parliamentary Secretary has confirmed that if the amendment is not accepted, the regulation-making power will be that in section 260. But that section does not seem to vest the power in the Minister of Transport; it appears to vest it in the Secretary of State for the Environment. Is there another provision in the Bill to amend that part of the 1960 Act, or has the matter been overlooked? The guidance attached to the 1960 Act clearly states that the word "Minister" relates to the Secretary of State for the Environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No.
262 is fairly ambiguous. Amendment No. 263 is unnecessary, as is amendment No. 264. These are not the kind of regulations that would require any kind of affirmative resolution procedure. I suspect that if I were to look up the right hon. Gentleman's record as a Minister in answering this kind of debate on legislation he introduced I am sure that I would find that he resisted similar applications for the affirmative resolution procedure for purely technical fee-charging regulations. I have looked at the matter carefully, but I think that I must still advise the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPOINTMENT OF TRAFFIC COMMISSIONERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 29, line 13, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"appointed by the Minister from"</p></blockquote>
and insert "elected by".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are also to discuss amendment No. 269, in page 29, line 20, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"appointed by the Minister from"</p></blockquote>
and insert "elected by".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments do not need a great deal of discussion but the principle is important. They attempt to introduce into the appointment of traffic commissioners the principle of election. This clause closely follows the 1960 Act and it is consistent in the way in which the chairmen and panels have previously been appointed. Some changes are to be made to the constitution of the panels. We are attempting to improve the situation, particularly as represented in Section 121(5) of the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) is largely the same. The chairman of the commissioners will be appointed by the Minister. The other two commissioners will be appointed by the Minister but from the panels. The changes are in regard to the panels in Section 121(5) of the 1960 Act. It is spelt out in that subsection that members are to be nominated to the panels by the local authorities each year and for that nomination to last only one year. I am not too sure what the experience has been. The Minister might tell us for how long people served. Our advice is that the tendency is to move away from placing on authorities an obligation to provide a nominee for the panels, but to retain for them the option whether to do so and to consider whether a member should be nominated for three years. I think a year is too short. Three years is an improvement particularly in such a job where experience is important in the judgments that a commissioner must make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst one would probably agree with the longer period, I do not see why—unless one does not want a statutory obligation—it is not embodied in the 1960 Act but is in the Bill. Presumably this allows greater flexibility and a greater opportunity for councils to exercise their options whether to take up the point. I take the Minister's nod of assent to indicate that I am right. However, that does not meet the basic point of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest that instead of appointing members to the panels, they should be elected. Instead of sending a list of nominees each year or every three years there could be an election to decide who should represent the local authorities. Presumably in a given area, a number of councils would have to get together. At present the Minister makes a choice from those nominated by nine or 10 councils. It is his decision. We do not seek to remove the Minister's right to nominate once members of the panel have been elected. The election would take only one small step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could go through all sorts of arguments for election rather than nomination. We do not seek direct election of commissioners. We want only those candidates available for the Minister's nomination to be elected. The democratic argument becomes more important in this Bill because the Minister seeks to ensure that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1495</span>
commissioners will change their attitude towards licensing of road transport services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard complaints from both sides of the Committee about the role of the commissioners. Perhaps some are justified. I have always thought that the commissioners have done a good job and I presume that they have their problems. I mentioned that Leeds district council complained bitterly about a commissioner's role and that he was not accessible to them during the evening. That is just one example of a case in which a council would feel that it had more control if it could elect the person to be nominated to the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had considerable argument about the inclusion of clause 1 and whether it could be amended. It set out the objectives of the Bill. I had the distinct feeling—the future will tell whether it was correct—that if the Bill were not clear on the meaning of "public interest"—and it is not as clear here as in past legislation— lawyers would be able to argue on an appeal to the Minister that clause 1(1)(	<i>c</i>) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"making it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences."</p></blockquote>
If public interest is important bearing in mind the obligation that we place on local authorities to co-ordinate and integrate services and the obligations of the PTAs under the 1968 Transport Act, these matters are likely to become extremely controversial. There will certainly be a considerable effect on the councils. Therefore, it may be more desirable that those on panels are more responsive to local authorities and more in tune with what they may want, whether or not they are appointed and known to have a particular view. It may be argued that one will get the usual Labour and Tory nominees, all with different views about transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that that will not be far from the Minister's mind when he appoints the chairman of the commission—which I think is done every three years. The Minister will be looking for people who are more in tune with the Government's new transport thinking. That is an understandable proposition. I do not attack it. But the other two members who will be drawn from a panel and eventually appointed—we suggest elected—are supposed to be responsive to other forces, namely the councils. The idea behind that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1496</span>
is, I presume, for the councils to have influence on other panel members. Otherwise, why does not the Minister just appoint all three. We do not need a panel from local authorities unless they are to be allowed some influence on the panel, which will make important decisions affecting transport services in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the principle behind the panels, why not take it a step further? It is true that it has not been done in past legislation and therefore would be unprecedented, but, after all, the Minister was an advocate of power to the people in the previous Transport Bill. He may consider that it would be another small step for mankind and democracy if he accepted the principle of election to the panels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15p.m.</p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) paraded an elegant argument, but it seemed to me that he knocked his own case slightly when he said that the amendment's first aim was to bring a little sense into the timing of the Committee. From that I imagine that he means that it is a makeweight amendment to delay progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see. It has some other meaning. Nevertheless, it is an interesting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain how the system of appointing traffic commissioners works, because I think that we have been talking about them from our different points of view. Traffic commissioners are still fairly unknown to the general public. Even more unknown is the system by which they are appointed to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens is that each of the county, regional and district councils nominates a person. Those nominations form two panels and from those panels I appoint, for each of the traffic areas, one person for each panel. One is the county council panel traffic commissioner, the other is the district council panel commissioner. I also select from each panel a short list of people who can serve as deputies during the illness, absence or incapacity of a commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is how the system has worked over the years. It is a system which goes back
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1497</span>
to 1930 and which, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, is included in the 1960 legislation. It is fair for me to point out that the system which was not changed by either the Transport Act 1968 of Mrs. Castle, or the Transport Act 1978 of the right hon. Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own view is that the system has worked well and has been well tried. I shall not, however, say that the system could not be improved. I know that some local authorities have found the present system of making nominations cumbersome and frustrating. In particular, district councils have come to this view because they may have made nominations that did not result in a traffic commissioner being appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I seek in the Bill a flexible regulation power, because it will be exercised after full consultation between my Department, the local authorities and district councils. The consultations are already in progress and I hope that we can come forward with a less cumbersome system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the panels represent the locally elected authorities—the county councils and the district councils. We are not seeking nominations from unrepresentative undemocratic bodies. Indeed, most of those nominated to the panels are elected members of those authorities. There are a few exceptions—retired members of district and county councils might be on the panel—but, in the main, elected members are nominated to the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given its democratic roots and that the system works perfectly well without, as far as I know, any major complaints apart from the one that I have mentioned, it does not make sense to change a system which has worked well and proved adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle is reasonably clear. The Minister said that some councils have found it rather cumbersome to be under the obligation. I understand that. Indeed, I presume that many councillors feel that nominating is a waste of time. It is inevitable in these systems that they should say "Why go through all this paper work when it does not mean
	<span class='label label-info column'>1498</span>
anything? The Minister will decide who he wants anyway."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not that so much as the fact that, in an area with many district councils making nominations, one council may not get a traffic commissioner for many years as a result of the luck of the draw, the luck of the selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to give a rational reason for a political prejudice, but inevitably it is felt. Our point is that when local councillors hold differing views about transport policy they should be allowed some flexibility under the Bill. Our principle would merely encourage councillors, who may be discouraged at the moment, to be in the nomination race.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillors are nominated to all sorts of bodies—consultative, gas, electricity, and so on. There must be hundreds of bodies to which they are appointed—not a lot fewer even after the quango attacks. Councillors might feel, if they had an election, that the person who came top of the poll in a region is the person whom the Minister should feel disposed to put on the board. I agree that that would take more options out of the Minister's hands, but since he appoints the chairman, it might encourage the local authority to take part in a democratic exercise to elect people and feel that it was worth while. Councillors reflect the political attitudes in an area. Those in the North are more likely to reflect a Labour attitude than are those in the South. Clearly, South Yorkshire's attitude is entirely different from that of Oxford and no doubt that would be reflected by its representatives on the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is clear. Having heard the argument and without more ado, we should like to vote for the amendment. For the record, I should like to correct a rather glib remark that I made at the outset about certain amendments. The point still has substance and the Minister was kind enough to say that there was an argument there. However, our case does not rest solely on that point and we should like to put the amendment to the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise two points. Both have in common the fact that the Minister, in proposing this part of the Bill to the Committee, is enhancing his own powers. He is giving himself power to make provisions in regulations which are currently established in our primary legislation. Therefore this is not an area in which regulations are being made for convenience. Regulation-making power is being chosen to put less control in the hands of Parliament and retain more in the hands of the Minister. That is unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two examples that indicate that there is a clear case for us to take the decision in the House. Without any shadow of doubt, the most outstanding example (is the removal of part A our primary legislation—the requirement for a commissioner, if he acquires a financial interest in a public undertaking, to offer his resignation. Until now our legislation has made that a requirement. There is no discretion. It is not a matter of regulation making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that is a right and proper provision and I am loth to see the Bill take away that provision from our law and leave it entirely to the Minister whether he, and he alone, will propose, to put before the House in regulations, a similar requirement. That should not be a matter for the Minister. It should be for the House to state clearly, with no dubiety or ambiguity that a commissioner who has a financial interest in a public transport passenger service should not be able to remain a commissioner without declaring that interest and putting the matter before the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second example is not so important in principle, but, in practice, can make a considerable difference to the operation of all those areas covered by the commissioners. It is the question of whether the chairman of the commissioners should be a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1500</span>
full-time appointee. I believe that the law as it stands requires the chairman of the commissioners to be a full-time commissioner. The provision in the Bill will take away that requirement and leave it as a matter for regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are two important derogations from worthwhile provisions of current law. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say as to why we should pass a clause which takes two valuable provisions out of our law. One is a matter of principle and the other is a matter of administration, in an area of which the Committee is very much seized.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has slightly mis-stated the position. If indeed I were doing the things that he said, he might have a very strong case—but I am not. We are taking subsections (4) and (5) out of the 1960 Act, but we are retaining, and it remains on the statute book— subsection (3). Section 121(3) meets exactly the right hon. Gentleman's point. The financial interests are specifically included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In section 121(10) he will find:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a commissioner acquires a financial interest in a transport undertaking which carries passengers"</p></blockquote>
Then there are a lot of other things—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister, may if he thinks fit declare that the commissioner has vacated his office."</p></blockquote>
That remains in as well. So there is the short point that I am making, and I understand that this is complex and complicated legislation, but we are only taking out subsections (4) and (5) of section 121. The remaining subsections remain, and subsection (6), in which
	<br><blockquote><p>"The chairman of the commissioners shall hold office during Her Majesty's pleasure, and shall be required to devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office."</p></blockquote>
—also remains in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1501</span>
That seems to meet all the points that the right hon. Gentleman has made. Indeed, the only reason that we are changing the regulation-making power for subsections (4) and (5) is so that we can have consultations with the district councils and the county councils on improving the system for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have checked the Minister's reference. I apologise to him. I had misunderstood the position.

I am grateful to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>MINOR AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS RELATING TO PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 253 in page 56, line 3, leave out paragraph 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, if carried would make a gap in the Bill and in our current legislation as regards the provisions for the qualifications of those who drive large passenger vehicles. That is intentional. I have moved the amendment to provide an opportunity to discuss whether our current legal provisions in respect of qualifications for driving vehicles are appropriate to modern conditions, or whether we should legislate in the Bill for new qualifications for drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contend that there is at least a strong prima facie case that we should make new provisions. Depending upon the Minister's reply, it is my intention to table a new clause before Report to wrap up in a single clause the law relating to qualifications for drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1502</span>
However, I should welcome an opportunity of hearing the Minister's views on the issues that indicate to me the need for new laws in that regard. I hope that it will be possible to obtain some co-operation and co-ordination with the people most affected, such as those who organise drivers and run transport services to ensure that the sort of clause that I have in mind will meet their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In examining this matter carefully, some obvious matters must be taken into account, such as road safety requirements and the extent to which it is necessary to update and replace section 144 of the 1960 Act. In that respect we have to take into account the changes in law that have taken place with regard, for example, to EEC law and the practice in the operation of public service vehicles over the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have to see whether we have an opportunity to eliminate some of the problems that have manifested themselves in respect of public service vehicles being driven out of service. I think that the Minister is aware that there have been a number of problems—for example, the driving of vehicles by trainee drivers and the driving of public service vehicles by mechanics after a vehicle has been repaired. Those circumstances have not been provided for in current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, we could see whether there would be any benefits from allowing some flexibility regarding the minimum age of those who drive large passenger vehicles. It is not necessary for me at this stage to isolate the safety aspects from the others. We should look at the principles that guide us in the determination of the law applying to those who drive large passenger vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1960 there have been other changes in the law that have a bearing on this matter—for example, membership of the EEC allows a reduction of the legal capacity for many purposes from 21 to 18. In this connection a number of grey areas in the law have been discovered in attempts to operate clearly the provisions of sections 117 and 144 of the 1960 Act. In particular, difficulties have arisen in the operation of the laws governing mini buses and community buses which have been introduced since 1960 when our present driver legislation was enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a specific area of difficulty in operating the present law in respect of road testing vehicles and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1503</span>
PSV driver training. Where vehicles are road-tested, they are frequently driven by fitters. Those fitters do not possess a driver's licence and it is arguable whether they are acting illegally when they drive vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Bill attempts, albeit in a complicated way, to address itself to that problem, but there may be a simpler and more straightforward way of dealing with the matter, which removes some of the dubiety that I think remains in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the 1960 Act has been operated with a degree of tolerance. Policemen and others who observe it have seen reasons why they should not enforce the law strictly. That reflects either on sloppy legislation or on the administration of the law. It depends which view one takes. I do not wish to pursue that matter at length, but we should not ignore it. If a difficulty has arisen which has been met by allowing flexible interpretation, we have an opportunity to put the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can find out, there has never been a provisional public service vehicle driver's licence. It is, therefore, impossible to train a public service vehicle driver in a public service vehicle if we operate the law strictly. In other words, if one needs a licence to drive the vehicle, and cannot obtain the licence without driving the vehicle, the law creates a stalemate. There have, I understand, been a number of occasions—perhaps the Minister can confirm this—when the police have issued summonses against men being trained in a public service vehicle because they were driving the vehicle without the necessary licence. That is, therefore, a problem to which we should address ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That way in which the Bill attempts to tackle the matter is complicated and relies greatly on definition. The Bill's definition of a public service vehicle seems to make clear that once it is licensed it remains so until its use as a public service vehicle is permanently discontinued. That part is straightforward enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill goes on to define stage, express and contract carriages in a way that relates to their being used for that purpose. We covered that aspect when dealing with the definition of stage, carriage and contract vehicles. However, to make the matter more difficult, we have in schedule 5 a convoluted provision amending section 144 of the 1960 Act so that:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1504</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding section 2(1) of the Transport Act 1980, in this section and sections 145 to 148 of this Act' public service vehicle ' shall be construed as meaning a stage, express or contract carriage."</p></blockquote>
The Bill seeks to overcome the problem in an extremely complicated way. Complicated laws tend to throw up grey areas which are difficult matters of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an ideal time to examine again how far the age regulations of drivers are appropriate to modern conditions. The first question that we should like to pose is whether it can be said that a driver aged under 21 is automatically less safe than a driver aged over 21. That seems to be the assumption in the legislation. I do not think that there is any justification for that automatic assumption. Statistically the answer would probably be "Yes", because such statistics as we have on driving safety relate to other vehicles. We have no statistics, of course, of public service vehicles being driven by people under 21. Therefore the statistical approach is not helpful. Even if we consider the sort of people who are likely to be driving various vehicles under the relaxation of the age restriction, I think that we shall still not obtain a conclusive judgment, but at least we shall have some criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, for example, that if a lad is trying to persuade his dad—who is the owner of a public service vehicle business—that he should be allowed to drive the bus, and given that he is working within the narrow limits of some easement of our legislation whereby he would have to prove himself capable, he would want to impress his dad and show that he could be trusted to do that sort of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take another example—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman, but I remind him that new Clause 20 has been selected, which deals specifically with the points that he is now raising, namely the minimum age for drivers. It would be more convenient if he reserved those parts of his argument for the debate on that new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Dean. My difficulty is that I am arguing that the effect of the amendment would be virtually to knock out the existing provisions of driver regulation and licensing. I am trying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1505</span>
to argue that there are a number of factors in favour of making a sweeping change, and of having not only a provision such as new clause 20, which deals specifically with the age limit, but a measure to deal with related questions—for example, whether categories of vehicles should be specified, or the driving of buses in special circumstances, such as the mechanic wanting to drive them without passengers after testing them, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn, on your advice, Mr. Dean, to the other factors, but I am merely pointing out that age is one of a series of related matters which give a strong prima facie case for saying that, before the Bill is enacted, it should contain a general clause dealing with a number of issues, including the age of the driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the insurance provisions that would be made. Until now, the evidence is that insurance companies have been, if anything, more conservative than legislators. Even where the legislator has set one limit, they have often put the premium up to a higher limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn away from the question of age, except in so far as it is caught up in EEC regulations. In regulation 543/69 a minimum age is fixed, and Parliament would not be able to vary that without an amendment to EEC regulations. That is connected with two matters. One is the mileage or kilometre distance. But it is also coupled, interestingly enough—and this is directly relevant to the amendment—to the number of seats. In the case of the EEC regulations, we are required to take a different view of the driving of vehicles with fewer than 16 seats and of those being driven on road tests. I think, therefore, that I have shown that a whole series of factors argue for having a more sweeping and general provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to summarise some of the vehicle movements involved which do not seem to be covered appropriately by driving regulations. They are movements between garages, parking areas, workshops, stations, terminals or other places on or off the highway for the maintenance of the vehicle; movements between such places for operational reasons, such as emergencies, breakdowns, staff difficulties or accidents on the road; movements between the owner's premises and the public weighbridge—admittedly, something that does not occur every day, but nevertheless occurs and requires somebody who has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1506</span>
legal right to drive a large passenger service vehicle; driving to the official test stations, the premises of the manufacturer or repairers; and driving to evaluate the performance of the vehicle during development work and testing on new vehicles, demonstrating the vehicle and familiarising supervisory staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a valuable feature of the best training schemes for those who are to supervise and administer large public service vehicle operations that they have a period of training when they are taught to take buses out and experience what will be experienced by the drivers whom they will administer. That worthwhile element of training does not appear to be covered by the present law. Those of us who have been observing buses more carefully than we did before we turned our attention to the Bill, will know that early in the morning or late at night buses are used to convey drivers and conductors to and from depots when they have no other means of travelling to their duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be considerable virtue in inserting a new clause which, if possible, could be agreed by major operator representatives, such as the Confederation of Passenger Transport and major unions in the industry, and have the support of those public authorities who want buses operating in their areas to be driven properly by people legally entitled to do so.
I hope that the Minister will respond favourably and perhaps indicate that he will initiate such consultations. I am so persuaded by the evidence that I have examined that there is a need for such an operation, that if he does not bring it forward, I shall attempt to do so. Obviously, without the resources of his Department, it would be a much more limited operation than he could mount, but it needs to be done, and we may be able to return to it on Report with a new clause to indicate drivers' requirements for these conditions, that will get rid of the grey areas of the law, without resorting to the convoluted language of the Bill, and without leaving any difficulties of administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has covered a wide area of problems arising out of PSV drivers' licensing arrangements. We are indebted to him. He has covered a number of difficulties that arguably exist in present law, but I hope to be able to satisfy him that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1507</span>
they are covered by the paragraph that he seeks to delete. I cannot believe that many more details could be covered by a new clause and I hope to persuade him that the Bill as it stands deals with most of his objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman concluded by conceding that if we were to re-open the question of PSV driver licensing, it would be necessary to consult widely with operators, trade unions and other interested parties. I cannot conceive that we shall have time between now and Report to go through the necessary consultations and to make such a wide sweeping reform in the Bill. I shall, however, seek to satisfy the right hon. Gentleman on most of the points that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help marshal the debate, I shall indicate what paragraph 4 seeks to do. Subparagraph (	<i>a</i>) is consequent upon the abolition of conductor licensing that follows from the Committee's earlier decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subparagraph (	<i>b</i>) makes an interesting point and will increase the duration of PSV drivers' licences from three to five years. The Government have proposed that small change in the present arrangements in order to reduce the burden of administrative paperwork on the traffic commissioners. We think that it will, to a modest extent, lighten their load and enable them more effectively to carry out their other duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subparagraph (	<i>c</i>) answers the question that troubled the right hon. Gentleman—the question whether a PSV drivers' licence is required for the driving of a public service vehicle or a large passenger vehicle when it is not carrying any fare-paying passengers. Paragraph 4(	<i>c</i>) defines a public service vehicle, for the purposes of driver licensing only, as meaning:
	<br><blockquote><p>"stage, express or contract carriage."</p></blockquote>
As the right hon. Gentleman correctly said, one must then refer back to the earlier clauses to find the definition of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"stage, express or contract carraige"</p></blockquote>
In particular one refers to clauses 3 and 4. Clause 3(1) makes clear that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 'stage carriage' is a public service vehicle being used in the operation of a local service".</p></blockquote>
The words "being used" also appear in the definitions of a express carriage and a contract carriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill therefore makes clear that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1508</span>
henceforth a PSV driver's licence will be required only when the vehicle is being used for the licensed purpose—that is, when it is carrying fare-paying passengers for hire or reward. In this way an area of some ambiguity in the present law is clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has successfully identified a number of areas where that ambiguity exists at the moment. The most important is the case of the fitter who is driving a vehicle, with no passengers, from a maintenance depot to a garage. At present it is open to question whether he needs a PSV driver's licence. I am not aware that any men have been prosecuted in such circumstances, but it is arguable that they could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, there is the question of the trainee who has not yet obtained a public service vehicle driver's licence. If the training is to have the slightest effect, he must be trained in a bus. At the moment it is open to argument whether or not he requires a PSV driver's licence. The Bill will resolve that doubt and make clear that the trainee may be trained on the road in a full-size bus, reproducing service conditions, without holding a PSV drivers' licence. Of course—this is important from the point of view of safety—he will not be allowed to carry fare-paying passengers while he is training. Once there are fare-paying passengers on the bus, a PSV driver's licence will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other areas of ambiguity. The effect of paragraph 4 of schedule 5—the very paragraph which the amendment seeks to delete—is to resolve the various doubts and ambiguities. I believe that it resolves them as those operating bus services would like them to be resolved. So far as I am aware, we are receiving no representations from outside to the effect that one ought to have a PSV driver's licence before one can drive a bus with no fare-paying passengers on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have clarified most of the doubts that gave rise to the probing amendment and the probing speech of the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a specific new clause dealing with the question of the age restrictions. It is not the Government's intention to avoid the issue. My right hon. Friend will face up to it directly when he answers the debate on the new clause. He will note the arguments that the right hon. Gentleman has already rehearsed and will pursue them when he replies to that debate. Since,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1509</span>
strictly speaking, that question is not encompassed by the amendment, I do not think that it is necessary for me to reply now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an amendment in the names of my right hon. and hon. Friends that that age should be reduced. That will be debated on new clause 20 which is the appropriate vehicle for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have satisfied the right hon. Gentleman that the paragraph that his amendment seeks to delete helps to answer a large number of his questions. It helps to answer them in a way acceptable to the industry at large and, I hope, therefore, that he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.00 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to clarify one or two points that should not be controversial? My information was that summonses had been issued, but I did not say that anyone had been prosecuted. I think that the police authorities have been persuaded that they should not proceed with the summonses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other issue to which the Parliamentary Secretary and I referred, concerning what would be acceptable to the industry, I understand, having checked with the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which is usually able to say where there is broad agreement, that the industry is not in favour of sustaining the contract, express and stage carriage definitions. To the extent that the Minister's answer hinges on the connection between schedule 4 and those definitions, it would not have been supported by the Confederation of Passenger Transport, because it does not want to retain the definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is detail. The principle, which I think is difficult to follow, is whether the Minister is right to say that that part of schedule 4 that I seek to delete solves all the problems. It perpetuates a clever trick. It provides that one needs to have the qualifications of a public service vehicle driver to drive a public service vehicle only if it is being used for contract, stage or express carriage. In other words, one can drive a public service vehicle, without being a qualified driver, provided the vehicle is not being used in any of those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why I am not happy about that provision. The first arises from the way in which we define it. Clause 2 clearly provides that the vehicle can remain a public service vehicle, even when it is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1510</span>
being used for stage, contract or express carriage purposes. It states that a vehicle shall remain a public service vehicle unless its:
	<br><blockquote><p>"use for carrying passengers for hire or reward has been permanently discontinued".</p></blockquote>
When we debated that, the Minister made clear that he intended those words to bear the normal common sense English interpretation. That means that if a bus is used as a public service vehicle one day for hire and reward and used a day later for hire and reward, but in between is used for another purpose, it is, nevertheless, in that intervening period, still a public service vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that we can get round the little problem of having properly qualified drivers in public service vehicles by requiring that they have qualified drivers only if they are being used for stage, contract or express carriage, does not meet the major concern of public safety. I do not know whether my views meet with the approval of unions, employers or local authorities, but I think that the general public would take the view, as I do, that we do not care very much, for safety purposes, whether we get run down by a bus that is running for stage, contract or express carriage. If we are run down by the bus because the chap behind the wheel was not safe to drive it, there is something wrong with our drivers' licensing provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I do not think that the basic aim of maintaining a safe system of operation of vehicles is met merely by our enacting the provisions in the Bill. We have to go into it more deeply, but I do not want to pursue it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Bill works a very neat trick which will solve some of the problems of operators. What it does not do is assure me that everyone who will be driving massive buses in all sorts of circumstances will be qualified, in my view, to drive a public service vehicle. Therefore, I do not believe that we have solved the problem in the way that the Minister suggests. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendments would allow, instead, delegation to one commissioner, where there were no outstanding relevant objections to an application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many road service licence applications are of a quite uncontroversial nature. Most are for renewals without modifications of existing licences. The hearing of the case is little more than a formality. In such a case, where there are no relevant objections, it is, in our view, unduly onerous to require at least two commissioners to hear the case. This is a practical amendment designed to minimise unnecessary bureaucracy. The existing legislation allows delegation of many matters to one commissioner, such as the granting of PSV licences, driver's licences, short term road service licences and section 30 permits. The amendment extends this delegation to straightforward, unopposed road service licence applications—for example, to renewals. The lack of delegation causes unnecessary bother now. Where there are any outstanding objections to be considered, the Bill still requires at least two commissioners to hear the case. This is a practical and uncontroversial amendment.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1512</span>

The present draft mentions journeys to and from destinations outside Great Britain. It is clearly odd to refer to journeys "from" destinations. This is entirely a drafting amendment to improve the wording of the Bill. The present phrase "from destinations" is, clearly, nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"bus service" in subsection (8), for "by section 117" substitute "in Part III".</p></blockquote>
I do not intend to spend a great deal of time on this. It is a probing amendment to ask the Minister what is meant by the provision we are seeking to amend. I started by looking at different pieces of legislation. I went to the Library to look at section 117, which is referred to as giving the definition of a bus service, only to find that it had been repealed by the Transport (London) Act 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into all the Acts. It will be quicker for me to ask the Minister the exact intention of this provision. I assume it to be that the fuel tax rebate shall still be available to stage carriage services that will now be conducted inside a trial area. We now assume that the trial area designated by the Bill will still have stage carriage services, but they will no longer have road service licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finance Act 1965 said that for stage carriage services as defined by legislation—particularly the 1960 Act and amending legislation—one was entitled to claim fuel duty rebate but only in respect of bus services that operated stage carriage services. There seemed to be some doubt on the part of the organisations representing the operators about whether the addition of paragraph (	<i>d</i>) to section 92(8) of the Finance Act 1965—since the section 117 referred to was repealed in 1960—meant that " bus service " was defined, as it was then, as a stage carriage service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the amendment is not correct, in the light of my further investigation into it, but will the Minister make clear that a bus fuel grant will be available only to stage carriage services—fare operators, as we understand it—inside the trial area and not to any bus service as such within a trial area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1513</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer both questions briefly. First, the paragraph of the schedule to which the amendment is directed is inserted to ensure that fuel duty rebate shall be available to operators inside trial areas on precisely the same basis as it is outside. So the same services that are eligible for fuel duty rebate in ordinary licence areas will receive fuel duty rebate inside trial areas. The availability of the rebate will be no wider and no narrower than that which prevails in other parts of the country. It is simply brought into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the technicalities, I quite accept that from the original section 117 to this provision there is an absolute maze. The answer is tucked away in clause 51(1), where a new definition of "bus service" for the purposes of the Finance Act 1965 is introduced. The difficulty of untangling the process of constant amendment to this legislation becomes easier once one substitutes that new definition. I see that the hon. Member nods assent. The apparent lacuna is cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that the amendment would mean that operators of any kind in trial areas would not be able to get a fuel duty rebate. That, plainly, is not the Opposition's intention and would not receive support from any quarter in the bus industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reference to clause 51 has cleared up that question.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Opposition for facilitating the Government amendments when they have been for drafting and other purposes. Clearly, it is right that whatever the disagreements about the policy of the Bill, both sides of the Committee should come together to make sure that the Bill we turn out is in a sensible and usable form for people outside. This is useful work.

However, there have been occasions when the Opposition have shown close interest in purely drafting and technical amendments and there have been times, particularly late at night, when some hours have passed in discussing amendments which are of a totally textual nature. I should be out of order too widely on schedule 5 if I were to enter into a debate on that, Mr. Dean. But it can lead to a reluctance on the part of Ministers to table large numbers of drafting and technical amendments if each one seems to give rise to hours of debate. We might be more encouraged to trawl through the Bill to make sure that we are spotting errors if, when we spotted them, they were given a fairly easy passage by the Committee.

I hope that I will save time by asking the Minister whether that was his intention or whether, in our amendment, we are striving after the same objective. Is it the case, as we would hope, that when we are talking of an international operation we mean a vehicle that starts off in this country, goes across our borders into another country and there would be no relaxation or exemption in any case in respect of that part of the operation carried out by a United Kingdom citizen driver if he did not take the vehicle beyond the border?

	<span class='label label-info column'>1517</span>
I hope that the spirit of willingness to accept Opposition amendments extends to this one, too. This is a probing amendment but whether we decide to press it to a vote depends on the answer we receive from the Minister. The amendment seeks to remove from the definition of relevant conviction an offence under the law of other member States of the Community. This refers to clause 24, about which we had a long debate the other night. The Opposition have great reservations about the concept that employers should have to inform the traffic commissioners about convictions for offences by their employees. There are tremendous implications in that part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now passed that part of the Bill, but we are concerned that the definition of "relevant conviction," as it stands, would include not only an offence prescribed by the Minister for the purposes of this legislation—we accept that part of the definition—in this country and in Northern Ireland, but also an offence under the law of another member State of the Community. Opposition Members want to know why the traffic commissioners should be interested in an offence committed in another member State of the Community and not in exactly the same offence if it is committed in a country which is not a member State of the Community. Why should it be interested in convictions in Germany, and not in Austria? Why should it be interested in convictions in Denmark, and not in Norway? I shall not elaborate, but I shall be very interested, in a probing spirit, to hear the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has taken me rather by surprise. I had thought that he would be pursuing the apparent purpose of his amendment, namely, that convictions in other member States of the EEC should be irrelevant. They should count, because, for the various purposes of this Bill, deciding whether a person is of good repute, and so on, given that relevant convictions will be traffic convictions, it is important to know whether a person has been convicted of dangerous driving, breach of drivers' hours, driving a dangerous vehicle, and so on, anywhere in the EEC. There is a mutual EEC obligation which is clearly to the advantage of all member States, in controlling their passenger service obliga-

<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, as I understand, the hon. Member has interpreted his amendment as a probing amendment to see why "relevant convictions" should be confined to the other member States of the EEC.

Let me clarify the point. Either traffic commissioners should be interested in traffic offences abroad, or they should not be interested in traffic offences abroad. If they show such an interest, that interest should be in all traffic offences abroad, and not just those in other member States of the Community. We are not part of a federal State of Europe. I do not see why we should pay particular attention to offences in France and Germany and not to those committed outside the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is neither one thing nor the other. The traffic commissioners should take into account offences committed in this country, and if they are also to take into account offences abroad, then why only in the EEC?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear that the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument is unanswerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have an intervention in an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to widen this debate to cover the virtues of membership of the EEC. Certainly, my enthusiasm for Europe does not extend to distinguishing between traffic convictions in Germany or Switzerland. Both are more or less reprehensible according to the gravity of the offence in whatever country they are committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the reason for singling out the EEC in the legislation is that our system of road service licensing is in many ways bound by Community obligations. Our system is to a considerable extent integrated with that of other member States. Throughout our discussions on the Bill, we have complied with Community obligations and made reference to those directly applicable laws which are binding
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1519</span>
here, sometimes directives to which we are giving force in the Bill. It is merely consistent with the fact that we have accepted EEC rules and directions and accepted those obligations upon us that we make specific reference to the EEC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I see no reason why the commissioners, in considering the phrase "good repute," should not interpret it in its broadest sense and have regard to any person's relevant convictions anywhere, in whatever country of the world. Clearly, there is no logic which says that that should not be so. Indeed, there might be certain serious convictions which might have been incurred under the jurisdiction of other States which we very much hope that they would take into account in considering good repute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think what we are arguing about is not whether the commissioners should consider convictions in any country but whether our Bill should specifically refer to Community convictions only. The reason why it refers to Community ones only is that it is consistent with the fact that we are, to some extent, aligning our system of road service licensing with the EEC. Perhaps I should undertake to consider whether we could not meet the hon. Gentleman's point of other countries. It is not the point of the amendment, which would go in another direction. I can think of no other logical argument for excluding convictions in any State where there are relevant convictions, which means traffic convictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Parliamentary Secretary is not wholeheartedly convinced of the relevance of convictions or offences in Community countries as opposed to those in other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the Opposition feel this to be a curious choice. I understand the Minister's argument that we are members of the Community, but if he is concerned about safety and about the importance of relevant convictions to the traffic commissioners then the provision should apply to offences everywhere in the world. Alternatively, if that application is too widespread, if it is thought that the law in some countries is loaded against drivers and that we should not take account of such convictions—an insular attitude which I would not necessarily adopt— the measure should apply only to offences in this country.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope not to detain the Committee for too long on this matter. I want to explain to the Minister the thinking behind the new clause and I hope that, even though he may not accept the new clause as it is drafted he will accept the principle underlying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are very concerned about the increase in moonlighting that could follow the implementation of the Bill. There are two aspects. First and most important is the safety of the public, and we are concerned to stop—or at least to narrow the gap to such an extent that it will virtually cease to exist— any practices that might spring up where, in an effort to cut costs, an undertaking will hire someone to drive after he has completed a normal day's work in another area of work, although he is a qualified driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the new clause is the best way to stop that from happening, but, if the Minister will accept the principle, there may be better ways. In no way do we seek to prevent a person from working part-time, but we are concerned to limit, for safety purposes, the hours that a man works—for example, in a factory all day and driving a bus afterwards. Basically, the clause achieves that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To highlight that possibility, I remind the Committee that EEC countries are working towards reducing the number of hours a driver may work and by January 1982 we shall have achieved equality across the board. Whereas this objective is desirable in itself it could in effect lead to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1521</span>
an increase in moonlighting. If the drivers drive for fewer hours, someone can, after a full day's work elsewhere, take that portion of the shift. That may very well happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not always necessary to legislate for the 98 per cent, who obey the law but we must legislate for the remainder who do break the law and we think that this clause is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, one must safeguard the genuine operators and ensure fair competition. At least the laws are the same for everyone. The clause will cut out a very undesirable but, unfortunately, increasing practice. Some people are working at two jobs and sometimes—I am not talking about the genuine operator—they will therefore do the job at a lower rate of pay. That practice, too increases the risk to the public, and clearly that aspect is our main concern. If the Minister could accept the principle of the new clause even if he does not necessarily accept the drafting, Labour Members of the Committee would be very grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to follow my hon. Friend who has explained very clearly the reason why we tabled this new clause. We hope that this principle will be introduced into the Bill, whether by the Government's acceptance of the clause or perhaps by the introduction of some regulations. We are very worried about the fact that the only control on the hours bus drivers work will be a control on the number of hours they work as bus drivers. It is reasonable to assume that, if the Government's proposals, in general become law, there will be an increase in the number of part-time bus operations and, consequently, in the number of part-time bus drivers. Again, if we are to have a flexible response to transport needs, we cannot ultimately object to the idea that perhaps in some rural areas a service can be provided only by someone driving a bus for a limited number of hours per day and therefore not earning a reasonable wage. We want to ensure, however, that, if a limited amount of bus-driving is to be done by outsiders in that way, those drivers will not be doing a full day's work as well and consequently endangering the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect to be considered. While that arrangement may be an acceptable solution in rural areas where
	<span class='label label-info column'>1522</span>
there is no other alternative, my right hon. and hon. Friends would not wish to see a general dilution of the concept of full-time bus-driving in areas where it would be possible to provide somebody with a full-time job as a bus-driver. We do not want people to be moonlighting—doing two jobs—and in effect reducing the number of jobs which are generally available. Whatever may happen in the future in this country, there will clearly be a reduction in the amount of work available for the population. That work must be properly spread out. We do not want to see some people doing two or three jobs while others are on the dole and do not have the opportunity to do anything at all. I therefore hope that the Minister will accept the general principle of new clause 14. If he cannot accept the new clause, we should be happy if he could accept something—in the form of regulations or of an amendment to a later clause in the Bill—that will meet the principles, which are that jobs should not be eaten up because people are taking two jobs where there is a worthwhile day-long job to be done, and that the safety of passengers and other road-users should be safeguarded. If one accepts that there should be a limitation on the length of time which someone is allowed to spend driving a vehicle, one must accept that other jobs are equally demanding and that people can become tired. We want limitation to be set on the number of hours a bus-driver may work, whether he is driving a bus or doing some other job for some other employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) by tabling this amendment have provided us with an opportunity to tackle an aspect of the safety operation of public service vehicles which is absolutely crucial. Whatever arguments we may have about how far other factors may impinge upon the safety of the vehicles, there can surely be no doubt or argument across the floor of this Committee, or between hon. Members on either side, that there is no greater hazard than to have a vehicle in the charge of somebody who is too tired to concentrate his attention on the traffic conditions in which he or she has to operate. That goes almost without saying. There can be few conscientious Members of Parliament who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1523</span>
have not themselves had to face an awkward decision from time to time as to whether they are safe to drive a private car. But, having faced that decision, they should be in a position to appreciate that our law will be defective as to the safety of public service operation if it allows people who are too tired to drive a vehicle competently to get behind a wheel there are behind them 40, 50 or 60 passengers who are dependent upon their skill for their safety, to say nothing of other road users. So the issue at stake is clear. There is no need to develop it or the merits of having sensible limitations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem quite clearly is how we can operate those within our law. We have had a most unhappy experience in this country of trying to deal with this problem by law. We started many years ago, if I remember rightly in the early 1970s, with a drivers' hours law which was intended to make a sensible appreciation of what was a safe period of work in a day which covered exactly the point which my hon. Friends have raised in this new clause— the relationship between one type of work or another; driving along with other hours. When the then Employment Secretary brought forward the first set of regulations to exempt certain categories of driving, I was appalled at the exemptions. They were legion. It is there on the record for people to read. He exempted everything from driving kids to the swimming baths to driving big wagons to construction sites. They were all exempted from drivers' hours regulations and the provisions made, in my opinion, nonsense of what had been a serious attempt to avoid this problem in our country by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we are faced, as my hon. Friends have very fairly mentioned, with the difficulty of trying to harmonise with EEC regulations on drivers' hours. The EEC does not make the distinction which my hon. Friends make in their new clause. The EEC does not count hours of work in other jobs as within the total EEC drivers' hours regulations. So it is possible for someone to start a job, shall we say in Dieppe or at Calais, for a Frenchman to work in, say, Calais for about 10 hours loading packing cases on wagons, then to get behind the wheel of a large TIR wagon, drive it through on to the ferry across to Dover and to start driving up our roads. We have been asked to harmonise with that sort of legislation. I merely say this to add point to what is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1524</span>
clearly a valuable amendment, one to which I hope the Minister will respond in a way which clearly recognises that if we are to try to make a serious attempt in this country to do away with the dangerous practice of permitting vehicles in general, and public service vehicles in particular, to be driven by people who are not fit, not by virtue of any lack of skill or experience but by virtue of their being too tired to do the job properly, something like this has to be taken into account. Nothing that has happened up to now under our own drivers' hour law or EEC law with which we shall have to harmonise, has successfully tackled this problem. Here is a chance for the Minister of Transport to respond on an issue which must be of considerable concern to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman is right on one point. If he is right that the employment of part-time drivers was, as he put it, a dangerous practice, there would be real cause for public concern. But I shall try to persuade the Committee that there is no evidence of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This familiar point on the employment of part time drivers has been put over a number of years. Certainly the Government, and many on both sides of the Committee, would argue against restrictions unless they were absolutely necessary. The presumption is against additional restrictions, rather than in favour of them. I believe that that is an uncontroversial point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the independent sector of the bus industry relies heavily on part-time drivers. They reduce costs because they are more flexible about shifts. They are obviously invaluable in the seasonal coaching trade. The Confederation for Passenger Transport, which has been quoted many times in the debate, very much defends their use and the value that they bring, in particular, to the independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore appears that, basically the right hon. Gentleman's argument, and the arguments of hon. Gentlemen who have spoken, come down to whether there is any evidence to show that the employment of part-time drivers is—as the right hon. Gentleman says—a dangerous practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1977 the Department of Transport and my predecessor, the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0828">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1525</span>
Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers) commissioned a study by Dr Hunt of Cambridge University, into relative accident proneness of full-time and part-time drivers. That study provided no support whatsoever for the thesis that part-time drivers are more likely to have accidents than full-time drivers. Indeed, the results, in some ways appeared to show the reverse—but I do not wish to make much of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent research which was commissioned—not by the present Government, but by the previous Government—-not by me, but by my predecessor-shows clearly that part-time drivers are not more prone to accidents than full-timers. It therefore seems that with that evidence, it is extremely difficult to substantiate the case that has been advanced from the Opposition Benches. I understand the concern that is expressed, and I would go so far as to say that, if that concern could be expressed in research or the figures that we have before us, that would be another matter. My advice is that that is not the case, and as that is not the case, and as part-time drivers make an undoubted contribution to the bus industry, supported by the confederation of passenger transport, as they undoubtedly make a mammoth contribution inside the independent sector, because of their flexibility, I believe that the Committee would be ill-advised to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that with some regret. I would like to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, but I know that he would want me to be frank in stating my view of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>want to make. One of the reasons why my hon. Friend and I tabled the new clause is that we are convinced that there will be an increase in part-time driving as a result of the changes which the Minister proposes to promulgate in the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if the number of hours worked has some relationship to safety, everybody accepts that that is so, there ought to be a clear advantage in favour of the part-time drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The part-time drivers on the famous survey should have been a lot safer than the full-time drivers. There was no great discernible difference Generally, the part-time drivers work in circumstances which are much less stressful, because they tend to operate in rural areas and at odd times of day, and in much less stressful traffic conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point is that if they work shorter hours, they ought to have been much safer, and they were not. Next, if we had gone to the length of introducing tachos into these machines because we are concerned about safety—the plea about the tacho all along has been that it would enhance safety—and are concerned about the number of hours a driver works as a driver we should be concerned about the hours he works in total. It is absurd to make a distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends will press the amendment, and will continue to press it whether or not it is written into the Bill. The Minister should recognise that the pressure that has built up on this matter over the years, to which he has referred, is unlikely to go away.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly to outline our objectives in the new clause, may I state that it seems that there is a considerable need for rationality about the age at which young men or women can drive public service vehicles. In principle, it seems wrong that the figure of 21, which is at odds with many of our EEC partners which allow people to drive such vehicles from the age of 18, should not now be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This seems to be a good opportunity to allow youth unemployment to be ameliorated, even in such a small way, particularly when one notes that the National Bus Company, a few months ago, found that in the North and South-East it was short of 2,000 drivers. There certainly seem to be opportunities there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems with career structures, where young men or women of 18 see as their future career the driving of public service vehicles and have a three-year wait. That must be a disincentive which has perhaps contributed to the shortage shown by one of the bigger concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seems logical to argue that, in view of the unsocial hours that the drivers of such vehicles are often asked to work, young men and women of 18 will be in a better position to accept unsocial hours than are married people with a family, to whom the time between four and six o'clock—teatime with the kids—may be highly relevant. It would, further, allow bus companies, of whatever size, to operate and provide a better and more logical training structure, which might result in highly responsible, useful young persons of 18 driving PSVs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem, therefore, to be a rationale with no real logic against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question may arise: does inserting this measure in the Road Traffic Act alter the age at which young people can drive heavy vehicles? That is not the case. Hon. Members on both sides need not fear that youngsters of 18 will leap
	<span class='label label-info column'>1528</span>
into articulated TIR lorries and trundle over Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly support my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills). The new clause is, as the Committee will see, a somewhat refined version of earlier new clauses—new clause 1 and new clause 8. The reason for the refinement is that, as originally drafted, it reduced the age to 19 but I understand that the Latey committee report, now widely observed in the framing of legislation, suggested that there was too much diversity in the ages that were selected as qualifications for all kinds of different purposes and that there should be a greater degree of uniformity. 19 was not one of the ages that the report favoured but 18 was. Therefore, I produced the second new clause, only to discover that its effect would be to allow people to drive public service vehicles from the age of 18 upwards but that they could then be prosecuted for doing so. That was not satisfactory, hence the addition to the new clause moved by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious point, because, as has been stressed, there is a considerable shortage of drivers in certain areas and, strangely, not least in the areas of higher unemployment such as the North-East. Clearly, it is desirable that those vacancies should be filled and also desirable that those of the age of 18 should have an opportunity to be trained and have some kind of career structure. If they do not get a job driving a public service vehicle, having been on the dole for some time, they may no longer have the incentive to take up such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, they may take up some other job and not move to driving a public service vehicle which could be a much better job than the one in which they started out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee by pursuing the matter in greater depth. But for all those reasons I believe there is a strong case for reducing the age to 18 as suggested in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend can help me. I believe he is concerned about the prospect of 18-year-olds driving double-decker buses or large coaches carrying a large number of passengers. Have I misunderstood the position? My hon. Friend, in moving the amendment, tried to reassure us that this did not mean that 18-year-olds would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1529</span>
driving heavy goods vehicles. But, if that is a matter on which we need reassurance, should we not equally be concerned about 18-year-olds driving large buses carrying 40 or 50 passengers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have consulted a number of groups of people including, for example, the Confederation of British Road Transport and I understand that on balance they think that it is much more a question of the individual. The distinction between 18 and 21 is not one which defines clearly whether a person is responsible. It turns more on the question of training than on the question of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time one has to appreciate that in the Armed Services there may be people of the age that we are advocating here who are driving vastly larger vehicles than a double-decker bus. By modern standards, in terms of length and so on, such a bus is not large when compared with some of the articulated vehicles which are covered by later clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also likely that in practice, if I understand the provision of the various interested bodies correctly, they would expect initially that those undergoing training would probably do so on vehicles that were not carrying passengers but were going from depot to depot, were on test or something of that kind. I think we can reasonably leave it to the various bodies concerned to ensure that a reasonable training programme is undertaken and that they will have regard to the fact that these young people of 18 are seeking a career. In many ways, the career structure argument is the most powerful one. Young people will be able to get on the first step of the ladder and then have a career progression, no doubt taking on tasks of greater difficulty as they proceed. I do not think that my hon. Friend need have doubts about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be some complications which, perhaps, the Minister in his reply will seek to clear up. The matter is not totally unregulated for this group. I believe there are some EEC qualifications which would need to be borne in mind. I hope that the Minister will support the new clause and that in replying he will make any suitable qualification which needs to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taking the opposite point of view from that of the right
	<span class='label label-info column'>1530</span>
hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), I urge the Minister not to accept the new clause. Under EEC regulation No. 543/69 drivers of passenger vehicles for journeys over 50 kilometres must be aged 21 or over, so there is no problem in that respect. However, the new clause would result in a lowering of that age limit for journeys under 50 kilometres, and some operators, no doubt, see a superficial advantage in the lowering of the age limit to help them to recruit staff. However, in practical terms, that could create difficulties for the same operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if an operator runs services covering journeys of both under and over 50 kilometres he will not have full staff flexibility if some drivers are over, and some under, 21 years of age. That could cause practical operational problems in a busy garage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An operator will also face difficulties with wage rates. Does an 18, 19 or 20-year-old driver, covering a journey of 49.5, kilometres merit the same wage as a 21-year-old driver covering a journey of 50.5 kilometres? If not, why not? Attempts by operators to use younger drivers as a means of reducing costs by paying lower wages will lead to friction in their industrial relations, and will, no doubt, be strongly resisted by the trade unions concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sorts of anomalies would arise if this new clause were to be accepted. If the aim of the Government is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the industry, the clause runs contrary to that aim. How are the police, for instance, to check if a driver has driven for more than 50 kilometres?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any sign that the Government are prepared to tamper with EEC regulation 543/69 by allowing very significant exceptions to it could well cause repercussions in the commercial road transport industry.

As the Minister is no doubt well aware, there has just been a ballot of drivers in the commercial road transport industry on the issue of regulation 543/69 and it was accepted by them only with great reluctance. Any tampering with the regulation could well cause a furore among these drivers who were persuaded to vote in favour of the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the aim of the amendment is to allow employers to attempt to recruit staff, I do not believe that it will have much effect on staffing levels. It is not age limits that are a barrier to the recruitment of staff in the passenger transport industry. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1531</span>
the low basic wages paid in the industry. It is the need to work excessive overtime, when available, to earn a reasonable standard of living. It is the compulsory working of unsocial hours. It is the problem of dealing with the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true to say that it would be a good job if it were not for the passengers, but some passengers make life extremely difficult for bus crews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for reasons such as these that employees and prospective employees find the passenger transport industry unattractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This applies even more to younger people, and a lowering of the driver's age limit will not alter that, despite the arguments of the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most employers can recruit staff. The real problem is in retaining them. There is a tremendous turnover of staff in this industry, as the Minister is no doubt aware. I respectfully suggest to him that he could better help the industry by having a thorough examination of the turnover of staff throughout the country, and the reasons for it, and possibly doing something to eliminate the problem, and the tremendous waste of resources in training people who leave the industry in a very short period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The travelling public generally receive a much higher and more reliable standard of service from crews who are prepared to make a career in the industry, and who have put in a fair bit of service in the industry. Our aim should be to encourage stable staff, but we are most definitely not going in the right direction to achieve that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also feel that much of what was said in opposition to the abolition of the licensing of conductors is equally applicable to the arguments on this new clause, but I will spare the Committee the repetition of those arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, Mr. Dean, I do not believe that this new clause will do the industry any good, and I request the Minister and the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the fears of the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) and find the arguments used by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) very persuasive. You will recall, Mr. Dean, that a little earlier this afternoon during the debate on another clause I was arguing that we should look
	<span class='label label-info column'>1532</span>
at the way in which drivers are licensed for the driving of public service vehicles in the context of the Bill. It should be done by taking into account not only age, but a whole series of other factors which have a bearing on the safe operation of buses. Having listened briefly to this debate, I am more strongly confirmed in that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) inadvertently misled the Committee in the way he reported the views of the Confederation of British Road Passenger Transport Ltd. I checked with the confederation on this matter which said that while it had not come to a firm conclusion the feelings of its members varied. Generally, the view is that the minimum age should be 19 or 20 within the context of an overall review of all of the regulations which govern the driving of public service vehicles. That is a different matter to changing from 21 to 18 years of age without considering the other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been pointed out, the EEC prevents us from lowering the age limit on journeys of more than 50 km. But none of us would be so blind to the reality of driving in Great Britain to say that providing a journey is not 50 km one does not need the same sort of skill, qualifications as one does over 50 km. Who would say that an 18-year-old driving round Hyde Park Corner in a double decker bus does not need the skill of someone making a 50-mile journey up a motorway or on a street with no junctions? One cannot merely look at the distances being travelled; one has to consider a number of factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country we have developed, over the years, a number of tests which we apply. Even the EEC does not solely rely on the distance covered. It makes an exemption for vehicles of 16 seats or less.
We need to look at all the categories of driver; the classes of vehicle, the size of vehicle involved, whether we want to adopt the 16-seat criterion of the Community, or whether we would rather have a category covering 8 to 12 seats—bearing in mind the Bill's provisions regarding car sharing. Surely hon. Gentlemen who argue that we need scope for training people of a lower age than 21 so that they can drive vehicles should welcome the idea that there are categories of driving which do not carry the same age limitations in which people could be trained. People
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1533</span>
training on an 8 to 12-seater could then more readily accept training for the large vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view of the industry is that on the larger public service vehicles there are factors in the necessary construction and use regulations which make for a vehicle that is harder to drive and needs greater skill. In order to provide for the emergency provisions of the bus one has to have a wider vehicle with greater overhang which calls for driving skill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is not the way to deal with the age of drivers but in the wider context. All the factors which make for safe driving, taking into account training requirements, driving vehicles under different conditions, PSV vehicles when they are filled with passengers—as opposed to when they are empty or used for training—should have a bearing on our requirements for driver licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will reject the new clause at this stage but will accept that there is a wide area to be looked at in which the qualifications for drivers in this country should be considered overall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the right hon. Gentleman, to my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to reduce from 21 to 18 the minimum age for bus drivers. Its effect would be limited by EEC regulation 543/69 to services out of scope of that regulation. In other words, regular services not exceeding 50 kilometres in length. It is not a general reduction. It would be limited in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why my right hon. Friend and many people outside the House would support a move of this kind is that they believe that it would make recruitment easier and would ease the position on staff shortages in crucial areas of the country. The aim of making it easier for public transport operators to find drivers must be applauded by all public transport users. Now that the age of majority in this country is 18, it is anomalous that one of the few things that an 18-year-old cannot do is drive a bus. Bus drivers are lost to the industry because that career cannot be started before the age of 21, by which time potential drivers have found another job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1534</span>
It is significant that among those who have been in touch with us and who have supported the new clause, are major public transport operators in this country. For example, London Transport is very much in favour, as are the PTEs. The reason why they are in favour is that it is in their areas that some of the worst difficulties in recruiting new drivers are found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Committee to accept the new clause, but I add one thing, because it is not a simple matter. EEC regulation 543/69, of which we know so much, lays down a minimum age of 21 for drivers on services within the scope of that regulation. As I have said, only on regular services with route lengths not exceeding 50km will it be possible to take advantage of the age limit in the new clause. That seems to be a perfectly defensible position. In such areas, and particularly on local urban bus services, staff shortages are especially difficult. The relaxation provided for by the clause will be of great value. It will also be a matter of choice for the companies themselves—for London Transport, or whoever—to consider their policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am considering with the Law Officers whether, at a later stage, a further Government should be introduced to clarify the interface between this provision and the Community law, simply to get our legislation in line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister explain to the Committee his understanding of the reference in EEC directives to vehicles with 16 passenger seats and over? Was it intended to provide that the relaxation of age limits should not apply in certain cases to vehicles with 16 or more passenger seats? If that is so, how would a piece of national legislation meet the sort of requirements that the Minister is talking about?. I understand that London Transport does not operate that many buses with fewer than 16 seats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We took minibuses out of regulation 543/69. That would answer the right hon. Gentleman's point about 16 seaters. The regulation will continue to apply to journeys over 50km. We are asking only for a reasonably limited expansion and deregulation. I recognise fears regarding safety, but having studied the matter carefully, I think that they are exaggerated. We must remember that full and special training will still be required before a driver is entrusted with a bus.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1535</span>
There is no change in that. It is, I concede, entirely a matter of judgment for the Committee. No new facts will come out in the debate that will sway the Committee one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that in Glasgow, for instance, where we operate buses that carry 78 seated passengers and five standing—a total of 83—and where all the routes are less than 50 kilometres, these buses will be able to be driven by 18-year-olds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It means that, provided the operator concerned wants it to be his policy. All that is being said in this new clause is that the restriction which at present puts a cut-off age at 21 should put that cut-off age at 18, which is the age of majority in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a whole range of debates on this matter. The only time that I defeated my own Government in 1970-74 was when I and my hon. and learned Friend for South Fylde (Mr. Gardner) voted with the then Labour Opposition to bring the age of jury service down from 21 to 18. A whole range of things have been done to standardise the age of 18 as the age of majority. I do not want to use emotive arguments, but it is also true that at the age of 18 and 19 people are fighting in our Forces in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the hon. Gentleman to understand that we are adjusting the regulation to the age of majority, but it is then a matter of discretion for the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If London Transport or the Glasgow or West Midlands passenger transport executives decide that this is a policy that they want to pursue, there is no legal bar to their doing so. But drivers must still be trained and must satisfy all the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of any evidence to suggest that the ages between 18 and 21 are critical in terms of accidents, I do not believe that it would be justified to stand out against what I think is a thoroughly sensible change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may clarify the point. The last tiling that I would wish to do is to mislead the Committee on the views of the Confederation of British Road Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the overall view of the Confederation is that there is a case for the reduction in the minimum age for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1536</span>
drivers, but that there is not complete agreement on the choice of the new limits. It says that, in general, there is probably a case for the age limit being 19 or 20. The Confederation then goes on to say, I understand, that because of this uncertainty it is content to leave actual decision to the legislators. That is, in effect, what it is doing. In short, it is agreed that there should be a reduction in the age limit, but it is not unanimous in its view of what that age should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the point that my right hon. Friend is making is valid—that the House generally has taken a view that the age of 18—rather than 19 or 20 which are, so to speak, non-statutory ages—is an appropriate figure to adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. I can understand in part that there is caution about reducing age limits. There is caution on many issues when it comes to reducing the age limit from 21 to 18. Bus driving is not alone in that respect. But I ask hon. Gentlemen to take on board the fact that this provision has not arisen from a theoretical desire to standardise ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of what the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness said, the real burden of what the bus industry is saying is that this would make a useful contribution to it in the areas where it is liable to be shortest of drivers—the cities, the PTE areas and London. My advice is to accept the new clause. I accept that it is a matter of choice but I believe that the balance of argument is heavily in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One understands the argument about the balance of judgment. We have heard that the operators have talked about the possibility of an age limit of 19. The House itself has decided upon 18 as the age of majority for certain purposes. In other respects such as homosexuality and the age of consent we shall hear arguments about whether it should be 21 or 18. One can understand the argument. But judgment is also exercised in relation to insurance premiums. Premiums levied between the ages of 18 and 21 are a clear guide. They are based on an estimate of accidents and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister has consulted the insurance industry about whether there is a difference between 18 and 19. Apparently, only legislators favour 18. The only other answer in legislation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1537</span>
has been the 21 lower age limit in the Bill. The Minister mentioned the Law Officers, and I should particularly like to hear what he has to say on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Parliamentary Secretary was questioned earlier regarding conductors, he could not see the relevance of maintaining the age limit of 21 in the EEC for journeys of over 30 miles. Might I suggest that if the Minister is to consider the matter, he should find out why the EEC— a combination of States and their Ministers—agreed on that? If the age is relevant there to safety, surely it is relevant in more congested areas. I hope that the Minister will tell us how he will reconcile our legislation with the EEC in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Directive 543/69, which was negotiated before we were a member of the Common Market—and no one can claim that that directive has been one of the greatest measures relating to the passenger transport industry—allows us some freedom and flexibility in respect of journeys under 50km.

On the question of insurance, it is bodies such as London Transport and the passenger transport executives who are telling my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) what they want. They are saying the same to the Government. If they find that a particular driver would incur a particularly heavy insurance premium, I suspect that they would not actually hire him.

All we are saying is that here is the regulation, here is what the law allows. What the public transport undertaker does is a matter for his own discretion. It is his decision. I understand that both sides of the Committee want to help public transport undertakings as much a possible. This is a modest way to do that. I ask the Committee to take on board the force of the argument advanced by the industry on this subject.</p>
