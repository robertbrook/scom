</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say just a few words about this significant clause. As the Committee will appreciate, there was an extensive debate on the principles involved in relation to clause 1 concerning an appeal provision within the London Transport Executive area. Although the clause 28 is rather mundanely headed "	<i>Other matters</i>", it was generally recognised in our debate on clause 1 that the innovation of such an appeals system had some significant implications for the future of transport in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also emphasised by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary that there was no intention in the Bill of engaging in any widespread reform of the London Transport system. That being so, one can restrict the matter to certain limited changes. None the less, I believe that it is recognised that they are quite significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, both my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) recognised that the effect on London would be to change the nature of the present statutory monopoly of London Transport. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not in any way seek to disguise or deny that the Bill will have an effect on the monopoly position".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 18 December 1979; c. 126.]</p></blockquote>
Now that the clause has been amended, it has even greater significance. The fact that the amendments have been accepted, and indeed welcomed by the Greater London Council, is very helpful. It is right that an appeal within London should
	<span class='label label-info column'>1434</span>
be to the Minister, as the amended clause now provides, rather than to the traffic commissioners. The argument for conformity with the rest of the United Kingdom cannot be carried too far, because clearly the London area is totally different. Nevertheless, generally speaking, in present legislation and in the Bill, the final court of appeal is the Minister and not the traffic commissioner. It therefore seems more logical that that should be the case in the London area, too. It would also be illogical if appeals were now to be to the traffic commissioners, when in past years they presumably have not dealt with road service licence matters because such licences were not required in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument closely, but I do not understand his contention that it is generally the case throughout the country that the commissioner is the final court of appeal. Surely in other parts of the country the commissioner is the original source of application and the Minister is the final court of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I said the commissioner, I certainly meant the Minister. My point was indeed that, generally speaking, it is the Minister who is the final court of appeal, and not the traffic commissioner. If I did not say that, that was certainly what I meant to say, and I apologise. That is the strong case for the amended clause and I am glad that there seems to be general agreement on that. There is therefore no need to labour the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that have been made also give greater rights to the Greater London Council to be consulted on appeals. As the principal transport planning and regulatory body in London, it is right that the GLC should have those greater rights of consultation. Again, I think that the concensus is that that is the right way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having established that there is a strong case for the amendments, I make the general point that whilst the question of right of appeal to the Minister is a limited matter, it could have significant effects upon London transport in the future. My hon. Friend referred to the need to introduce a breath of competition into London transport. He emphasised that we in no way regard competition as incompatible with service to the public. Indeed, he said that sensible competition could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1435</span>
make a contribution to public passenger transport. Nevertheless, if a greater element of competition is to be introduced into London transport, after years of monopoly or near-monopoly, some fairly delicate matters of political judgment may well arise. It would be less than fair to the traffic commissioners to introduce them into what might well be a political area. I do not speak of politics in the belief, although naturally it is my hope, that the Greater London Council will be for ever Conservative controlled, or that we shall for ever have a Conservative Minister of Transport. Clearly, political balances may change. Nevertheless, I believe—and I suspect that this is why the Opposition were prepared to accept the amendments—that with London transport it is right that the Minister should have a say in these matters, and that the Greater London Council should also have the right to be consulted to a substantial degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important clause. I very much welcome it. Its implications will perhaps not be fully grasped for some time. But it gives considerable scope for change and, one hopes, improvement in what one can only describe as the deteriorating transport facilities in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a good deal about Bills being drafted so that they may be understood by the man on the Clapham omnibus. For once, that is appropriate. The clause refers to those responsible for running the Clapham omnibus—and a right old shambles they are making of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not refer exclusively to the London Transport Executive. I wish above all to stress that the London Transport Executive is not the only body responsible for the present mess of the London public transport system. I am opposed to the clause, even amended along the lines proposed by the hon. Member for Faver-sham (Mr. Moate), because it represents a proliferation of the authorities responsible for London transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First I turn to the question of how the clause came to be included in the Bill. One would look in vain at the consultation document issued in the summer for any suggestion that the statutory monopoly of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1436</span>
London Transport in bus services was to be taken away. The idea was introduced later. I understand that the London Transport Executive was consulted in September. Presumably the GLC was also consulted, as the leader of the GLC announced on 27 November, shortly after the publication of the Bill, that the monopoly enjoyed by London Transport to the exclusion of all others would disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the GLC supports the removal of the statutory monopoly. At a subsequent meeting the GLC policy and resources committee approved a number of requests for reports from the London Transport Executive by I April 1980. One of those reports was on the effects of private enterprise bus services in London. At the moment neither the GLC nor the Minister have the benefit of any studies on the introduction into London of private enterprise bus services. The policy is certainly a leap in the dark. No one has made any substantive assessment or analysis of the likely effects of the introduction of those services. Equally no one has done any analysis of other aspects of the Bill on public transport in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I object to the proliferation of responsibility for London transport. The amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Faversham to some extent place responsibility with the Minister, who already has some responsibility for public transport in London. To that extent they represent an improvement on the Minister's original proposal that the traffic commissioners, who at present have virtually no responsibility, should have responsibility. The amendments are a good thing in that we do not wish to see anyone else interfering. Nevertheless, another finger is being stuck into what is already a most unsatisfactory pie for those who rely on public transport in London. A major problem is the present multiplicity of organisations responsible for London transport in some way or other. The London Transport Executive is responsible for operating most of the buses and the tube system. British Rail is responsible for operating the suburban and the long-distance railway services that serve London. The GLC has some financial and policy authority over the London Transport Executive. The Ministry of Transport have considerably more influence than the GLC because they are the source of both capital and revenue for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1437</span>
London Transport. It does not even end there. The London boroughs are heavily involved in traffic management and bus provision. In addition the Metropolitan Police have some responsibility for such matters as traffic measures and bus lanes. That has provided a perfect recipe for buck-passing in London. If anybody goes to any of the existing authorities and says "Why are you making a mess of this"? the answer will be "It is the other lot down the road. We are trying our best".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of an appeal against London Transport's decision not to allow private operators in any place will mean that when the Minister overrules the decision of London Transport, it will say, when approached about any decline in the quality of its service, that it is not to blame, because the Minister took the decision. So another excuse has been built into a system which is already ruined by excuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to illustrate the irresponsibility of the present system for managing London Transport generally. On 14 November the leader of the Greater London Council denounced the London Transport Executive's budget as unacceptable in its whole approach. He went on to say that London Transport must improve its own management performance and face up to its own responsibilities. However, the point not made at the time was exactly whose approach was wholly unacceptable, and who did not face up to their management responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the London Transport Executive was appointed by the GLC since Sir Horace Cutler has been its leader. When Mr. Bennett was appointed by the GLC, which has some responsibility for London Transport including the appointment of the chairman, Sir Horace Cutler was reported in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> in 4 February 1978 as saying that for the first time the Tories had the chairman they wanted. He is the man who is now being denounced from the rooftops by the GLC. It seems that the GLC is not accepting responsibility for the people it has appointed. That is characteristic of the present system in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be as lenient as possible with the hon. Gentleman because of the air of amity that has broken out in the Committee this morning.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1438</span>
However, I hope that he will steer his argument back to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to demonstrate, perhaps with lamentable lack of skill, that we already have a system in which those responsible for one aspect or another of the provision of transport in London are constantly blaming some other party and shuffling off responsibility to someone else. It seems than when the GLC appoints the chairman of London Transport and later blames him for what it says has gone wrong with London Transport, that demonstrates the degree of irresponsibility which is built into the system. It is my contention that to provide an appeal against the decisions of London Transport on private operators is to build into the system yet another escape route for London Transport and for the GLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain what the responsibilities of the two major bodies are. The London Transport Executive is empowered and has a duty,
	<br><blockquote><p>"with due regard to efficiency, economy and safety of operation, to provide or secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as best meet the needs for the time being of Greater London".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the services at present provided could be much further from the objective set out for London Transport which I have just quoted from the Transport (London) Act 1969. In relation to those direct activities of the London Transport Executive, the GLC has the duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to develop policies, and to encourage, organise and, where appropriate, carry out measures which will promote the provision of integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services for Greater London".</p></blockquote>
Likewise, I do not think that the man in the street waiting for the Clapham omnibus would feel that those objectives are being met under the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers the problems of London Transport and talks to one of the existing new divisional managers, the managers will say that London Transport cannot provide their services properly, usually for three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the shortage of staff, which is normally blamed on the Government's wages policies, and this will continue to be a reason for blame whatever the Government's policies are. Second, they say that they have great difficulty in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1439</span>
operating bus services on overcrowded roads. London Transport staff will say that that is the responsibility of the GLC who are not providing them either with the roads we need or with priority services on the roads. They will say that it is a symptom of the failure of the Metropolitan Police and the boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, London Transport will say that there is a shortage of buses that are fit for service. At this point I should explain that it is not a question of certifying officers saying that the buses are unfit for service. London Transport readily acknowledges that large numbers of its fleet are not fit for service and it now places its faith in the provision of Titan buses which British Leyland were to have produced at Park Royal in London. It was announced a few months ago that production would be transferred to a plant in Lowestoft. We read recently that the Lowestoft plant will not now be able to produce the Titan buses, so there is another excuse built in. There has been central Government responsibility, as well as that of the GLC and London Transport, in discussions on the provision of buses for London Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister in his intervention provided yet another excuse for the failures of London Transport and the GLC. We need to know now what kinds of criteria the Minister will lay down when a private operator applies to provide a service in London. It is not the case that London Transport has turned down every application by a private operator to operate in the Greater London area. It has accepted a number of applications from private operators, but it has agreed to the introduction of private operators only in those cases where it felt that it was providing an inadequate service and there was no possibility of it providing a decent service. It refused applications where there was already an adequate service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems apparent to me, to my hon. Friends and to London Transport that it is now likely to be faced with applications within the London area from private operators who wish to cream off the profits on the paying routes in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much objection, especially from Conservative Members, to the concept of cross-subsidisation within a bus organisation. But even they must believe that, of necessity, London Transport must try to make a profit from some routes and spend those profits on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1440</span>
providing unprofitable services on other routes. It will therefore go to the heart of the functions of London Transport if the Minister allows private cowboy operators to come in and take the paying routes away or provide parallel private enterprise services from paying routes already covered by London Transport. The people of London are entitled to know what kind of criteria the Minister will apply. Having listened to his speech on Second Reading, read reports of speeches that he has made outside the House and listened to him in Committee, he appears to me to be almost fanatically committed—I do not generally regard him as a fanatic—to the concept of introducing an element of competition, even on inner urban bus routes. We regard that as quite barmy. Those of us representing London seats regard any action likely to take money away from London Transport, as well as provide it with an excuse for an inferior service, as likely, in the long run, to lead to worse services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not referred to London on other clauses, but other aspects of the Bill will have a damaging effect on London transport services. If car sharing is to have any substantial effect, it is likely to be in the outer suburbs where a good number of people want to travel in one direction, from a fairly small source location. As has been pointed out, that development is bound to take some traffic away from London Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of the Bill that is bound to have an impact on services in London is the question of contract carriage transport when people regularly hire a coach. That is likely to take passengers away from London Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two aspects, combined with the provision to allow the Minister to override London Transport Executive's views regarding competitive services, are likely to damage the overall level of service provided by London Transport in Greater London. The level of the service is bad enough already. No one is defending it and I should be the last one to defend the competence of the London Transport Executive's management, its political masters at County Hall, the effects of the interference of the Department of Transport, or the failures of various bus manufacturers to provide reasonable vehicles. There is already a legion of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1441</span>
excuses. We certainly do not want to provide more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If London Transport is supposed to be providing a coordinated and efficient service, it is unreasonable, when someone applies to provide a service that London Transport does not think is coordinated, efficient and economic, for it to be overridden by the Minister, and to expect it to continue to provide the service that it presently had a statutory obligation to provide. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will not vote for the clause. I hope that it will be rejected because it will have a most damaging effect on services in London and in particular lead to a proliferation of excuses and bodies who will have a finger in the pie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need one body with full responsibility for the provision of transport in London and with the authority to do its job properly without having to go cap in hand to all the other organisations presently involved. Only in that way shall we be able to identify one group of management that is responsible for the provision of public transport in London. While we have a variety rather than a singularity of responsibility, we shall not have a decent service because we shall have a perfect recipe for the buck-passing that has gone on in the past. I hope that the Minister will not provide a further excuse for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The appeal right or provision that is the heart of the clause is an issue which the Opposition regarded as of considerable importance the first time we read the Bill. You may recall, Mr. English, that on clause I we spent a considerable time stating our view that that appeal-provision should be defined in clause 1 as one of the objectives of the Bill and we were finally successful in persuading Ministers that we were right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, another benefit that emerged from that debate has a bearing on clause 28. At that time the Minister made clear to us that he was not absolutely hide bound as to the form of appeal printed in the clause and he said, very fairly, that he would be prepared to consider other forms of appeal. I welcomed that and, incidentally, I should welcome a similar sort of approach to a number of other clauses where we might have an indication well in advance whether the Minister sees that he is stating an objective rather than nailing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1442</span>
his colours to the mast for a particular way of obtaining that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has the same objective but now achieves it in an entirely different way. Having accepted the amendments from the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) the Minister is demonstrating what he said to us earlier—that he has an open mind, he is prepared to consider another system of appeal and that the system we now have to consider is one of appeal to the Minister rather than to the traffic commissioners. Therefore, I wish briefly to examine how far that will attain the sort of objectives that the Opposition believe should be attached to an appeal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other parts of the country—and the hon. Member for Faversham sought to make these comparisons—the initial application is to the commissioner and the appeal is to the Minister. We believe that those who have responsibilities for transport policies and plans—whether they are elected Ministers in London or elected representatives in metropolitan or shire counties—should not be treated differently unless there is a very good case for so doing. However, they will be treated differently under the procedure that will flow if the Bill goes forward in its present amended state, first, in their right to submit a view to the commissioner. At present, in any part of the country other than London, if the local authorities, particularly those responsible for transport plans and policies, feel that the granting of an application or even the attachment of certain conditions to an application for a road service licence, for example, would cut across the policy plans and objectives of a county, they can represent that view to the commissioners. In fact, the commissioner is in a semi-judicial position of having to decide on the basis of the criteria of public interest whether it is better to set the wishes of the applicant against the views of elected local authority representatives with responsibility for planning transport in their areas. That difficult decision now falls to the commissioner. We make no complaint that there should be a right of appeal against that commissioner's decision, and we argue that there should be an equal right for the applicant for the licence and the elected local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when we come to London under the proposed appeal provision, it is questionable whether there is any direct comparison.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1443</span>
Therefore, we ask the Minister, since he supports the new form of appeal, how he justifies that different system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of the Opposition take the view that it is difficult for the Greater London Council to discharge its responsibility in respect of transport planning policy, partly because of the nature of the capital and its transport system—nothing in the Bill will automatically change that— and partly because of the GLC's constitutional relationship with the London Transport Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be frustrating for members of the GLC, when they are approached by electors complaining about the transport service, to have to say that they cannot deal directly with the matter as it is the responsibility of the LTE. However, outside London in the shire counties and the metropolitan counties councillors can say "We will see that the views of our authority are represented to the commissioner and we will press the commissioner hard".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not get out of the difficulty of the relationship. It is my experience, from consulting a number of councils, that if they were here they would argue that one of the solutions would be to change the relative powers of the local authority to the transport executives and give the local authorities more power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are dealing with this only in the context of the appeal and the extent to which the relative power will be affected by the appeal. The Minister should advise the Committee whether he expects the proposed appeal system to bring about a greater equity in the rights and responsibilities and power of local authority representatives to make their representations. In the event of an application to the London Transport Executive for permission to run a new service being turned down, and an appeal being made to the Minister, will he say, "Now we have an opportunity to treat the Greater London Council in the same way as a commissioner would have treated the county or metropolitan authority in the event of an original application to a commissioner in other areas"? In other words, will the Minister see himself as sitting in judgment between the respective claims of applicant and local authority, or sitting in judgment on an argument or debate between the applicant and the transport executive? Or does he ee another role for himself? That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1444</span>
important to the way that the appeal system is to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to recognise how much feeling exists among the travelling public in London, and in the Greater London Council. If he takes the view, as we have reason to expect that he does, that there should not be a fundamental change in the relative powers of the GLC and the LTE, or of county and metropolitan authorities and their respective transport executives, he should be prepared to consider the representations of the GLC on the effect of granting licences on the services because we believe that it has a considerable degree of accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I must in fairness point out, as did my hon. Friend, that London Transport Executive's record on reaching agreements with other operators is remarkably good. In all the difficult circumstances of London, I can see no general evidence that the London Transport Executive has not been prepared, in the overwhelming majority of circumstances in which there has been application from somebody who can run a service on a route which the London Transport Executive cannot cover, to come to an arrangement allowing another operator to come in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, unless the Minister uses different criteria from those so far used in other areas, we are likely to be dealing with a minority of cases. That makes it more important for the Minister to say something about the criteria that he would use, in the light of other changes being made in the commissioner criteria, so that from his comments we may form a view on the use that will be made of the appeal system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15a.m.</p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the concern of the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) about the situation in London. I do not think that anyone can be happy about the bus provision in London. That point has been made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) has improved upon our intention here by making the appeal against a refusal by London Transport Executive to enter into an agreement with another operator for the provision of a London bus service not to the metropolitan traffic commissioners, but to the Minister. That is a significant change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1445</span>
In effect, therefore, there are two changes. First, there is the change made by the Bill, that for the first time there should be an appeal. That is of fundamental importance. Secondly, there is the provision that appeals should be made to the Minister and not to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to comment on the appeals procedure. Clearly, under the present appeals system, and under that previously laid down in the Bill, it is unusual for the final decision to rest with a traffic commissioner on any matter outside London. There is normally recourse to the Minister. I do not think that would-be bus operators in London should be denied similar access to the Minister. Indeed, London Transport, against which the appeal is made, may feel that the case ought to be heard by the Minister. I therefore take the view that the appeal should be direct, rather than via the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Committee debated the subject during our lengthy deliberations on clause 1, much concern was expressed about the present state of London bus services.' I hope that the new proposal will make a contribution to its improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may put the matter in context and then return to the details. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham, I am convinced of the need to open up more competition and new services within London. London Transport should be encouraged to see other operators as making a contribution towards meeting the needs of London, and not as posing a threat to the London Transport Executive. That is why I believe that an appeals procedure is necessary. As the Opposition have said, an important change is being made. We hope that, as a result, a better bus service for the public can be provided in the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) referred to the man on the Clapham omnibus. I must point out to him that, sadly, the number of Clapham omnibuses and the standard of service provided have been in decline for many years. That is why we are seeking changes. I will give the hon. Gentleman some figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Journeys by public road transport in London were at a peak in 1948, with more than 3J million journeys. By 1978 the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1446</span>
number of journeys had fallen to less than 1½million. That is the pattern of decline. We have seen a reduction from 3½million to 1½million over the past 30 years. I do not believe that anyone in the GLC or the LTE would deny that the performance of London Transport buses is also worsening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge and welcome the efforts of the GLC and London Transport to bring about improvements. I note that the GLC has taken prompt action to investigate Mr. Chapman's recent allegations of wasteful spending by the executive. However, I must tell Opposition Members that we are not wedded—as they are—to the concept of an integrated network of bus services provided by the large corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we see the importance of London Transport. None of us denies that for a moment. However, we also see scope for the small private operator who might be able to offer the travelling public some choice of service. We think that competition provided by such operators can be valuable to larger and longer-established operators and a spur to improving services, rather than a threat to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to see new services develop in London and we have therefore attempted to loosen some of the restrictions that prevent that happening. Lowering those barriers is important, though I must stress that it will not, of itself, provide an automatic solution. However, I believe that it will make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the appeal procedure, which has been changed by my hon. Friend's amendment, is that it will make London Transport think twice before turning down an applicant for an agreement. Indeed, I hope that it will go further, and create a presumption in favour of reaching an agreement between London Transport and the private operator who wants to provide a service. Our aim is to bring about a change in attitude, not to create work for lawyers and bureaucrats in dealing with appeals. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point out to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South that there are signs that the GLC and London Transport are receptive to that approach. The leader of the GLC has expressed his intention of pursuing the possibility of bringing in more private operators, and we understand that London Transport is content with the appeal procedure that we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are to be appeals—as there must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1447</span>
be—I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham that it is appropriate that, as Minister of Transport, I should hear them. I recognise the concern of Opposition Members about what could be an uncomfortable position for the commissioners in the matter. That is why we have sought to change the provision. Clearly, the GLC has a right to be heard on such an important issue and we do not wish to deny it that right. I shall say something later about the criteria that will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am content that the amended clause provides the best form of appeal procedure. I should also like to emphasise my wish that such a provision should be applied only occasionally. I hope that London Transport will abide by the spirit rather than the letter, of the clause, and seize the opportunity to work with other operators to give the London bus traveller a better service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that what is important in transport policy is the interest of the travelling public. That is what our policy is designed for and aimed at. Of course we understand the operators' point of view, but we are concerned most about the standard of service to the travelling public. I therefore welcome my hon. Friend's amendment as I believe that it will be of immense value in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points of procedure and criteria raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South. In respect of procedure, amendment No. 200, which is now embodied in the clause, states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister shall not proceed with the appeal unless he is satisfied that such notice has been given"</p></blockquote>
to a number of people and bodies previously mentioned, but that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining an appeal under this section the Minister shall take into account any representations made by the Council"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the GLC—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any representations with respect to relevant road traffic matters made by any of the persons notified".</p></blockquote>
There is no question but that the GLC will have a right not only to notification at the time, but to make representations to the Minister. A further point—and it is a fair one—was made by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1448</span>
the criteria under which the Minister will come to his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, clause 28 inserts a new section into the Transport (London) Act 1969, as the hon. Gentleman stated. Clause 28 must be read, and any appeal heard, in the context of that Act and the responsibilities and powers conferred in it on London Transport. Those are laid down in section 5 and require the executive to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"perform their functions, in accordance with principles from time to time laid down or approved by the Council … to provide or secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as best meet the needs for the time being of Greater London".</p></blockquote>
Certainly the GLC has a right to be consulted and to make representations. In reaching his conclusions, the Minister will also have to bear in mind the criteria laid down in the 1969 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will not be the letter of the law which is important, but that London Transport will see that private operators in London can make a contribution which I believe will be to the benefit of the public. As we all know, there is dissatisfaction with bus services in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us would claim that the clause is a panacea, but it is a sensible step forward and a contribution to the provision of transport in London. On that basis, I seek support for the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned at the way in which the Minister has replied. Without saying so directly, he suggested that the criteria will bring about greater competition between the London Transport Executive services and those of some private operators on the same routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister implied that, which is fair enough, but he did so without giving any indication of whether he sees such competition being within fare levels or on a wider basis that would include fares. There seems little doubt that the LTE could be happy to compete, in the fullest sense, with private operators on routes where it could probably provide a better service but for the other obligations to the network that it feels are encumbent upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it seems that in this clause, as in so many others in this part of the Bill, one of the differences between us concerns the importance of sustaining networks. The case of London is highlighted by a comparison with other capital cities. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1449</span>
clear that in the cities for which we can obtain figures about the degree of support for public transport systems, there is massive Treasury aid for their maintenance. I believe that the figure can run as high as 70 per cent. in some capitals, and that 50 per cent. is not an uncommon figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London Transport Executive tells me that it operates at about a 17 per cent, subsidy, which it believes to be one of the lowest—if not the lowest—for any equivalent operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without claiming any worldwide experience of transport in capital cities, but having looked at the public transport systems of a few capital cities in Europe, it seems to me that the problems faced by the London Transport Executive are no fewer than those of other capital cities. It has to provide—and succeeds in providing—a transport service with a far lower measure of subsidy. That impinges upon the network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a clearer indication of how far the Minister's criteria will allow for that. Will he say—as he logically could, because he is a Conservative Minister and has his own views about the desirability of competition—that he wants to see competition on certain routes? He may say that he realises that there will be competition only on those routes where there is a profit to be made and therefore, there could be totally open competition within the checks and balances that he needs to apply in the appeal system, and that that would cover fares competition. He may say that if London Transport wants to respond to that competition and to try to run the hind legs off the other operators by running a better service at the same or lower fares, he will accept the financial implications for the other routes that London Transport presently covers by the cross-subsidy system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Minister has not said that. He has been silent. Will he indicate whether, in determining the criteria, he will also determine the degree to which he is prepared to support the maintenance of the public transport system in London? We are talking about the means by which 90 per cent. of London's citizens get to work. Those who come in by private transport are the minority. To the majority, this is an extremely important matter. Will the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1450</span>
Minister indicate the percentage of the network that he considers to be supported within London Transport Executive's arrangements, by cross-subsidy plus the 17 per cent. of public money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Minister do if London Transport responds to his upholding appeals in certain areas by saying "Okay, we will compete and withdraw from other areas"? Will he tolerate that, or will he say "The conditions under which I operate the system and provide the subsidy on behalf of the British taxpayer are such that I will require you to sustain that network"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is crucial. It is a different situation from that which exists in other areas and much more hangs on it. That is not to suggest that I think that networking in other areas is not important. I am well aware that in my constituency the majority of services are upheld by a networking arrangement, but I recognise that, if there were a breakdown or withdrawal of only 20 per cent. of the network in London, in order to have free and open competition in those areas covered by appeals, it would bring networking arrangements to a halt in many areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to press the Minister for a further answer on how he will handle the criteria and how he reconciles them intelligently with the degree of support or subsidy at present provided to London Transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At my request and that of my right hon. Friend, the Minister has referred to the criteria to be applied in deciding applications from private operators for the right to operate services in Greater London. To my surprise—if I heard the Minister aright—I discovered that London Transport will be applying exactly the same criteria that it has always applied, because the Bill does not change them one jot. If it has been doing its job properly, it will continue to do it in exactly the same way, save for one thing, as we approach 1984: the threat that Big Norman is watching them.
That is not an acceptable approach. If it is suggested that different criteria should apply, they should be spelt out. It is unreasonable to say to London Transport, "These are the criteria that you have always been expected to apply. Continue to apply them, follow the letter of the statute, but change your attitude at the same time." It is absurd.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1451</span>
When considering the appeal, the 'Minister will be bound by the criteria set out in the Transport (London) Act 1969, so, in a sense, we are back to the point that we have made on many clauses, namely that it will all depend on the discretion of one or two individuals. I think that, generally, people are entitled to have something better on which to rely than the discretion of one or two individuals, be they traffic commissioners, vehicle examiners or Ministers of Transport. Therefore, the Minister owes it to the travelling public in London to spell out the criteria on which he will exercise his discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman told us that he would exercise discretion on the basis of the Transport (London) Act 1969. He has not had that discretion before, so he will need some datum point on which to judge matters in his Department. He owes it to the people of London, and to all those who will be consulted under the Bill, to say what sort of genuine criteria he will apply. 1 do not expect him to do it now, but he should spell out the criteria to anyone who makes representations to him. Otherwise people might as well not make representations. They should know what sort of target they are aiming at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make two points regarding the row about the waste of money by London Transport. First, if money is being wasted—and it is the GLC which makes that criticism—it is being wasted by those whom the present GLC appointed. The GLC should therefore take responsibility, because it is crucial in our society that those who appoint people to a job shall take responsibility for how their appointees do the job. There is no question of the GLC shuffling off responsibility for waste of money by London Transport. If money is being wasted by London Transport it is being wasted by the people whom the GLC appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the concentration on gold lame curtains and top people's grub at the London Transport Executive is a diversionary tactic. We should be concentrating on the money and resources wasted out on the roads by poor provision of services, lack of co-ordination and the general shambles that is being disorganised by London Transport. What they do at headquarters is a piffling tip of the iceberg of what is wrong with London Transport. I hope that the people of London will not be diverted from looking at the standard of service and the waste of resources in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1452</span>

London Transport should be encouraged to see other operators as making a contribution to meeting the needs of London rather than as posing a threat. I see no need to divide into two opposing camps. New operators may come forward and may be able to make a contribution to travel facilities in London. The hon. Gentleman, if I have understood him correctly, has said that he does not regard the present provision as satisfactory. Doubtless he would argue that it could be improved in other ways.

He has completely ignored the fact that those same operators can come forward now and seek agreements. There is no evidence that London Transport does not facilitate the making of such agreements.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me stress again the intention of the clause. As I said to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South, the clause must be read, and any appeal must be heard, in the context of the Transport (London) Act 1969, particularly section 5 of that Act. That lays down that the general duty of the LTE shall be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to exercise and perform their functions, in accordance with the principles from time to time laid down or approved by the Council"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1453</span>
—that is, the Greater London Council— and
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide or secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as best meet the needs for the time being of Greater London".</p></blockquote>
The last part of that is crucial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has left out some vital words. The LTE are supposed to do all those things
	<br><blockquote><p>"with due regard to efficiency, economy and safety of operation".</p></blockquote>
It is in the area of assessing efficiency and economy that it seems to me vital for the Minister to lay down the criteria that he will apply when dealing with appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could read the whole of section 5, but I do not think that it would affect the sense of what I have said. Short of redrafting the 1969 Act it is extremely difficult, as the hon. Gentleman will no doubt agree, to do as he would like. Certainly the criteria remain the same. That is important and may be partly what the hon. Gentleman has been arguing about. Section 5 of the 1969 Act draws those criteria fairly widely by saying,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as best meet the needs for the time being of Greater London".</p></blockquote>
The point of having an appeal is not only to provide a check on how well that task is accomplished by London Transport. There is potentially also the opportunity for a Minister to take a different view of the criteria. The appeal, as in many other cases, is there for the benefit of those</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness asked whether we were committed to maintaining the public service of London Transport within London. Of course, we are totally committed to that. I agree with many of the remarks made by the right hon. Gentleman on that subject. We argue simply that in some circumstances an additional contribution can be made. That additional contribution is a matter of judgment. It is unrealistic to ask me to try to lay down criteria to govern the Minister's actions in all kinds of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the preservation and continuance of the network would be taken into account by the Minister. Of course it will be. But it will not be the only matter that we take into account. If there are gaps in the service, and if services are not being provided at particular times of the day or night, we shall also take that into account. The Minister is certainly governed by the criteria of section 5, but clearly he will take into account both the network and the need and opportunity for new services to develop.

This is an important change. However, it is not intended to be a panacea for the travel problems of London. It is intended to be a practical contribution, in some circumstances, to solving the travel problems of London, and I believe that on those grounds it should be supported.</p>

	<div class='title'>ABOLITION OF LICENSING OF CONDUCTORS OF PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose clause 29. It appears that the only organisation involved in the road passenger transport industry that is opposed to the abolition of licensing of conductors is the Transport and General Workers' Union. In fairness to it, however, I point out that this opposition arises from a genuine conviction that it would not be in the public interest to do that, nor would it be in the long-term interest of people employed as conductors in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic philosophy of the Government's Transport Bill is to increase competition. However, in pursuit of this myth, they are prepared to put the travelling public at risk by the removal of quality controls from the current bus licensing laws. Under section 144 of the Road Traffic Act 1960, a conductor of a public service vehicle must be licensed and cannot hold such a licence unless he is over 18 and a fit and capable person. The licence is renewable every three years. Every conductor wears a badge of authority—such as this old one of my own—showing the licence number which can be quoted by a member of the public who has a complaint about the conductor's behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lawyers ought to wear them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Justifiable complaints can lead to the revocation of a licence, and the person cannot be employed again as a conductor until the licence is renewed. If such a licence is not displayed by the conductor, who is to know whether the person collecting fares is actually the person entitled to collect them?
The licence is also a partial protection for the conductor, giving the authority to collect the correct fare from passengers. There is a danger that the abolition of licences could expose these public servants to greater degrees of assault and abuse from those who want to avoid paying their fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the removal of all controls in respect of the conductor will also go the minimum age requirement of 18 years. This will permit employers to recruit school
	<span class='label label-info column'>1456</span>
leavers at the age of 16 for the purpose of conducting buses. The TGWU has the greatest concern to ensure employment for school leavers but is also concerned to protect both the fare-paying public and those conductors who are increasingly vulnerable to physical attacks.
Taken in conjunction with clause 18 of the Bill, which will effectively weaken the controls on public service vehicle licences, protection of the public will be further diluted by de-licensing the conductor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transport and General Workers' Union will continue to maintain its unremitting opposition to these proposals, and I seek an assurance from the Minister that the protective legislation governing the employment of young persons will not be altered in order to accommodate these illconsidered and dangerous proposals. At present the legislation does not apply as conductors must be over 18. I would be totally opposed to any attempt to vary the current legislation or to give an exemption in the case of passenger transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
EEC regulation 543/69 states that the minimum age for conductors shall be 18 for journeys within its scope, that is, journeys of over 50 kilometres. However, most local services, particularly busy urban services, would be outside that regulation and the removal of the age limit would mean that young people of 16 could be employed as conductors and exposed to all the difficulties to be encountered in such an occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A conductor requires a great deal of patience, tact and experience of dealing with the public, and especially at times with an aggressive and irritable public, some of whom have no intention of paying the proper fare or any fare at all. There is always the ever-present menace of the hooligan element and passengers under the influence of alcohol.
It is asking a bit much to expect 16 year olds to deal with such situations, yet that is what the clause will allow. Apart from the fact that this is a form of cheap labour—which is probably why all the operators are in favour of the clause—I remind members of the Committee of remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) at a previous sitting of the Committee about the value of experienced conductors who can deal with problems on board their vehicles, and I emphasise the value of my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1457</span>
right hon. Friend's remarks. To allow the employment of young people between the ages of 16 years and 18 years on many of the routes presently operating would be to expose them to unnecessary risks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abolition of any form of quality control, in my opinion, is a retrograde step to take and one that I urge the Minister to reconsider. I am totally opposed to the clause standing part of the Bill and ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. Roger Moate 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am joining with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall). I must express my concern about the dilution that will result from the proposal in clause 29, because, as my hon. Friend pointed out, that will have two major effects. First, there will be the disappearance of the conductor's badge. Secondly, there is the effect on the present age limit of 18 years, below which no one can be a conductor on a public passenger transport vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the subject of the badge, it can be argued—indeed, I believe that it is the case—that the existence of the badge is intended to be, and is, a help both to the public and the conductor. From the conductor's point of view it is to an extent a badge of authority and provides for a small measure of restraint on those who might be given to assaulting bus conductors. There is far too much assaulting of bus conductors and far too much trouble for bus and transport crews generally from a certain hooligan and sometimes drunken element. I believe that the existence of the badge gives some element of authority to the conductor and perhaps a small measure of protection for him. The case is similar for those reluctant to pay fares where, again, there may be an element of authority in the badge, particularly for those operators who do not require their staff to wear uniform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the additional point that the badge exists as a protection for the public. It is intended as a protection for the public, since the number can be taken from the badge if a member of the public is dissatisfied with the service, general attitude or anything else of a bus conductor. Indeed, that is possible for someone who is dissatisfied with the service of the particular bus on which he is a passenger. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>1458</span>
can report that it was conducted by a person with a specific badge number. Therefore, there is an element of protection for both the conductor and the public in the requirement to wear a badge that would be abolished by clause 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, it seems that the age limit is wholly sensible. I hope and believe that, even if clause 29 is agreed to, by management policies and through negotiation with responsible trade unions there will continue to be a minimum age limit of 18 below which it will not be possible for people to become bus conductors. I believe that the unions involved in organising people in the bus transport industry will be pressing for the maintenance of a de facto limit of 18 even if the de jure limit disappears as a result of the clause. I would certainly applaud if the clause disappeared because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston pointed out, someone of 18 years has a little more knowledge of life and a little better chance of coping with troublemakers or drunks on a bus than someone of 16 years. After all, a person of 16 should not really have encountered any drunks except when walking down a street because he is not allowed to enter a pub. Therefore, that is an element of preparedness that a conductor would not be able to command at the age of 16 or 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way, members of the public can look for more responsible behaviour from 18 year olds. Nobody is pretending that a gate crashes down and people become responsible at the age of 18, but in the upper teenage bracket it seems likely that, generally speaking, somebody will behave more responsibly at the age of 18 than at the age of 16 when they have just ceased to be schoolboys or schoolgirls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a complication that results. I never understand EEC regulations very well, Mr. Moate, and it is possible that I, like you, do not set out to understand them particularly well either since I regard the stable from which they emanate as wholly reprehensible. But I understand that EEC regulation 543/69 requires conductors to be over the age of 18 on coaches travelling more than 50 kilometres. However, it places no age limit on conductors on buses travelling less than 50 kilometres. If anything, that is the wrong way about because with the exception of odd trips with football supporters I reckon that the bus conductor would generally encounter more trouble
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1459</span>
at 11 o'clock at night on a local service than he would on a bus running from Nottingham to Nuneaton or even from Nottingham to Faversham. Therefore, as usual the EEC has its regulation the wrong way around. Whatever the change in domestic law, there will remain the EEC requirement that a conductor on a bus service travelling 50 kilometres or more will have to be aged 18 or over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having stated that defence of the present position I believe that we can exaggerate the effects of the clause, particularly since responsible managements and certainly all trade unions in the transport industry will be pressing to keep an age limit of 18, even if that is not required by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who may be bothered about the disappearance of the clause 29 should realise that none of the railway guards or railway ticket collectors who travel on trains or ticket collectors at barriers is required by law to have a badge nor wears one. They wear a uniform that gives them an element of authority and none, to the best of my knowledge, is under 18 years old. The reason no one under 18 is employed in those jobs is because the trade unions involved ensure that a de facto age limit of 18 is maintained on the railways and on London Transport. That has been one way, certainly within the railway system and the London Transport system, of effectively maintaining the 18 year age limit. I hope, therefore, that our colleagues who are responsible for organising the majority of bus services will feel that they can rely on the actions of their own trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholeheartedly support the view that there should be, in practice, an 18-year-old age limit. It will only be maintained for the protection of the public and the operators by responsible management and by managements who have to negotiate with responsible trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility, in certain limited marginal services operated by oddball cowboy outfits, that the driver's 16-year-old daughter is the person collecting the fares. The protection of the public will be at its lowest and the danger to staff at its highest if this clause is accepted, in those oddball outfits with irresponsible management and no trade union representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two very
	<span class='label label-info column'>1460</span>
distinct parts to clause 29. I do not want to rehearse completely all the arguments that have been presented. I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) in his argument for retaining this power. He made many valid points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not beyond the wit of man to take care of some of those arguments by the employer himself giving a badge to each conductor so that passengers will know who to complain about. Indeed, they may want to applaud the actions of a conductor. On balance, however, in the interests of identification the management would issue some form of identification for the conductors. That would, therefore, be taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the arguments made so far, there does not appear to be a great deal of concern about that aspect. But there is considerable concern on the age limit. This is definitely the wrong time to talk about lowering the age limit. Whether we like it or not—and clearly we do not—we must accept the fact that attacks on public servants are on the increase. At a time when that is so, regrettable as it is, this is a very inappropriate time to reduce the age limit to below 18. In fact, one could argue that the age limit should be higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is accepted unamended there could be a 16-year-old schoolboy— or, even worse, a 16-year-old schoolgirl— employed on a bus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MICHAEL ENGLISH 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that if this clause, and the new clause which reduces the age qualification for public service vehicle drivers, are carried, a 16-year-old boy or girl could act as a conductor with an 18-year-old boy or girl as the driver in charge of a double-decker bus carrying up to 80 passengers and possibly facing some very difficult situations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend hits the nub of the matter. We cannot talk about age without also considering experience. One could argue that the employer would fully train such young people before they take over their duties. Up to a point that could be a fair argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the theme that I have pursued throughout the Committee. We do not legislate for the genuine. Ninety-nine per cent, will do this. In their own interests,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1461</span>
they will train people of that age. But what about the cowboy operator? He will not go through all that. He will use this, first, for cheap labour, and secondly, to employ school children on a part-time basis. There is nothing to prevent that. That is the other aspect of the age limit of 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this, because it is a worrying aspect. I am not too worried about the badge. I think that that can be dealt with. But I am very worried about the age limit. The Minister must take into account the fact that this could allow a cowboy operator—I know that he does not like that phrase, but I use it none the less—to employ a school kid before he has even left school. I know that regulations are already in force with regard to hours. Nevertheless, this is a very worrying aspect. Perhaps the Minister will therefore give us some assurances on that, although I do not see how he can do that. We might then look again at clause 29 before it goes to a Division. I shall be most grateful if the Minister will deal particularly with that very worrying aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly to support the clause. I believe that licensing for conductors should go. I have borne in mind the comments of my hon. Friends, but on balance—and it is an argument of balance—I believe that the clause should go through as it is and should not be opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that in the division of responsibility between driver and conductor in the operation of a bus, it is the conductor who is responsible for the relationship with the public. The driver, by and large does not meet the public on many occasions because he has a very particular job. The conductor presents the image of the operator to the public. I appreciate the argument that there must be quality control, but it begs the fundamental question of whether issuing a licence is the only way to achieve quality control. I believe that that is a doubtful assumption. If the operator is vigilant, quality control can be exercised without a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As all members of the Committee know, there have been bad conductors from time to time. Present licensing regulations have by no means ensured quality control at all times. Moreover, in urban areas such as Ipswich, we are moving rapidly towards the use of buses without conductors.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1462</span>
If technical changes of that kind are increasing to obviate the need for conductors in urban areas, much of the present regulation is probably irrelevant. In addition, if we have any confidence at all in our young people, especially with the improved education that they now have, and if there is to be any return at all for the money that we put into the education and training of young people, I believe that in certain limited circumstances young people can be given responsibilities, provided that a careful watch is kept upon the way in which they are trained. I do not know how much training is needed to be a conductor with various operators under the present regulations. I have certainly met many young persons who would go into the bus public utility and who would make very good conductors indeed. Maturity and ability to achieve good relations with the public are not necessarily measured in terms of age. If the employer keeps a vigilant eye upon who is employed and who is not, I believe that in the present new situation conductor licensing is probably a relic of the past and that, on balance, it should go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of clause 29 and the associated schedule will mean that the licensed conductor's badge of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) will become a museum piece in due course. We propose to eliminate the need for conductor licensing and I hope that his badge appreciates in value and becomes a collector's item.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As he acknowledged, the only organisation which I am aware has made strong representations on the subject is the Transport and General Workers' Union. Otherwise, everyone with an interest in passenger transport seems to agree with the Government's preferred solution of dispensing with conductor licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we are doing away with licensing does not mean that we underrate the importance of choosing the right sort of conductor. Nor do we underestimate the difficulties that arise with some passengers. Unfortunately, there are far too many attacks on bus crews, and on particular routes at particular times of night, they are badly treated by drunken members of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the problems can now be properly dealt with by sensible manage-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1463</span>
ment. As the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) said, it will be management in consultation with the trade unions, no doubt, and will allow for the right criteria to be applied for conductors for a particular job, for particular routes, and the various matters mentioned by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), all of which are important. There is, for instance, a badge of indentification. A conductor will certainly be given some sort of distinctive badge, if not a uniform. There are many other occupations in which people are given a badge as a symbol of authority and identification without any need for a Government licensing system. One only has to think of the railways, with the porter's badge and the station master's hat and son on, which are not backed up by an elaborate system of commissioners issuing licences. There is also the question of the character and health of employees with which the commissioners are presently concerned. They require two references and a medical certificate to support an application to be licensed. They are the obvious things that any employer will consider before taking on staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of the age of the conductor. We are rightly abolishing the statutory minimum age of 18. EEC regulation 543/69 stipulates that drivers must be over 18 years of age on journeys within the scope of the regulation. But regular services of not more than 50 km are outside the scope of the regulation. The result is that local stage carriage services will not be affected by the regulation. In practice in this country, almost without exception, the shorter stage carriage services still have conductors. Our law will apply to all the usual operators who still have conductors on their buses and there will be no minimum age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for the Government to express a view on minimum age. That will be considered by managements and negotiated with trades unions. I do not believe that there are cowboy operators in the stage carriage business. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is very fond of that phrase, which is fairly elastic. But the stage carriage operators in this country are not normally open to allegations of cutting corners or running buses on a dodgy basis. They are, by and large, the more responsible and established operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when it comes to suitability for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1464</span>
dealing with difficult customers or a late-night fracas on the last bus home after closing time, one could face the choice of a 17-year-old conductor who is a heavyweight boxing champion and bends iron bars as a party trick, and a 45-year-old frail and diminutive lady. The idea that anyone under the age of 18 is not physically fit or suitable to deal with difficult customers strikes me as unusual. There are many 17-year-olds whom I have encountered who would be better dealing with a drunk on a late-night bus than I, or many bus conductors. Fortunately it is not for me to have any say in the choice of conductors, generally or for a particular route, nor should it be a matter for the commissioners. The reason we are doing away with that system is that it is time-consuming and bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed to learn that the traffic commissioners' staff handles no less than 30,000 applications each year for conductor licences. Over the past decade, only a few dozen appear to have been rejected, so a totally meaningless and useless exercise has been undertaken on a function which ought properly these days to be exercised by management or, where there is a unionised labour force, management in consultation and negotiation with the trade unions. We would simply be cutting out one of those quite unnecessary operations with which governors saddled themselves in the past and which have outlived their usefulness. I therefore commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not delay the Committee unduly, but there are a number of dissenting voices on this side of the Committee over the Government's attitude towards conductor licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary that the procedures give no protection whatever to the public, primarily because they are bureaucratic, do not exactly encourage those of us on this side who may be in a balance about the issue. That is something about which we perhaps think differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been no complaints generally about the character of conductors. Indeed, there has been much praise for them in what are sometimes difficult circumstances, especially with the ever-increasing incidence of violence on buses, which we all condemn and, I hope, do whatever we can to reduce. Nevertheless, in all reviews by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1465</span>
Governments of both parties of the procedures of traffic legislation since 1930, there has always been the question of whether conductor licensing should be removed, but up to now it has been retained. Public service licensing for bus personnel is being retained for the driver but not the conductor, under present proposals. There is merit in the arguments of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that conductor licensing should be ended and I should like to ask the Minister a few questions on points which he might wish to consider before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister agreed that there is a reducing number of conductors on buses. In my area, Hull, the issuing of bus grants and so on has greatly encouraged operators to move towards what in the industry is termed the OMO, or one-man-operator system. That has more or less decimated conductor services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London bus services have not made that choice. They experimented with it but found that buses stayed too long at bus stops and became too involved in the problems of efficiency and economy. It was decided to retain the conductor because not only is he a valuable asset in the maintenance of standards and understanding among passengers, but he makes a positive economic contribution in that his presence means that an expensive bus is not delayed on its journey and there is an attempt to maintain a regular service. The judgment in London is that without conductors the services would be worse, and I feel there is an important point there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other parts of the country have a mix. Brighton Corporation has conductors on its buses for the same reasons as London Transport. There are many sides to the argument over whether it is a declining force. Certainly a conductor force will remain. The Government argue that at present there are 30,000 applications for conductor licences, despite the decline. This is a bureaucratic hindrance for the commissioners, and it is felt that those standards could be readily checked by the employers at the place of work. Larger bus operators could, I imagine, have a similar policy in regard to the character of busmen and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern begins to develop about what my hon. Friends have referred to as the pirate operators. It is all right for the Minister to refer to the present practice and say that problems have not occurred,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1466</span>
but he is changing the essence of the transport industry. That is what the Bill purports to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the two sides of the Committee is that, particularly in profitable areas, keen competition is desired by the Government. We think that that will lead to a reduction in service. Competition, for the Government, is king.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argued that standards can be maintained by the operator. We argue that the standards of safety and efficiency maintained by large operators are not those maintained by small operators. The evidence is conclusive. We have grave concern about the maintenance of standards. Here, we are talking about reducing standards for one of the personnel on a public bus, namely the conductor. We feel that the small operator will, where he can, take economic advantage of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to EEC regulation 543/69, which provides that for journeys beyond 50 km an age limit will be imposed. That means that nobody below 18 years of age will be employed on a public transport vehicle on a journey of more than 50 km. The Minister made the point that particularly in the local fare stage transport system, we have, in many cases, no conductors at all, with the huge exception of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first inconsistency, albeit small in mileage, is that the operating area for controls on fare stages and licensing tends to be 30 miles. So there is a margin of about 1¼miles in which the EEC regulations say that an age limit of 18 shall apply, but the legislation that we are considering says that the age may be 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as age
limits are concerned, leaving aside the other licensing requirements, there will be no age limits as the Bill stands, except, because of the directly applicable EEC regulation, on journeys of more than 50 km. Where the journey is more than 50 km, the EEC legislation, which happens to be directly applicable here, specifies a minimum age of 18. That has no relationship to the other road service licensing rules. Whatever the type of journey, if there is a conductor and the journey is longer than 50 km, the age will have to be 18 or more, because we have accepted the EEC law and we are not changing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1467</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact the 18-year-old conductors will be on journeys of over 31.25 miles on which conductors are used. I am pointing out that the area of controls in licences is measured at 30 miles. There may be an argument either for making it 35 miles or for bearing a little inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more substantial point concerns why the Community decided suddenly that there should be an age limit beyond a certain distance for a conductor on a public transport vehicle. There is one good reason. As always, the Common Market is obsessed with competition, though it is not as fanatical as Government Ministers about competition. The EEC does not allow it to dictate the reality of the situation. Having spent five years in the European Assembly, I am sure that the Commission will agree that it does not want unfair competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be other arguments, but I want to stress the economics. It is cheaper to employ a 16-year-old than an 18-year-old. If controls are to be imposed, the limit of 18 years can be set so that conductors are, basically, are paid a similar rate. The cost to the operators will be the same and I assume that operators will not want to use a less experienced man— namely, one who is under 18 years of age. When we are considering those between 16 and 18 years, we are also bearing experience in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community says that there is a difference between an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old in that case. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to a youth who might be a heavyweight champion and tough enough to handle a drunk. I strongly disagree with him—even though I realise that he was being jocular to an extent— because, on balance, having lads as conductors on buses tends to lead to violent incidents in circumstances when an older man will realise that tact is required. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with that. If a man wants to be aggressive, he may be encouraged when there is a young lad before him, rather a man of 24 or 25—or even 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to prolong the argument, but is the Minister stating emphatically that in no circumstances would he be prepared to consider that the employer can take care of such matters as his staff's character and quality, and whether, because of the possibility of violent incidents, a conductor should not be

employed? Will not the Minister accept the principle that the Community has accepted, albeit in respect of distances beyond 50 km, that an 18-year-old should be suitable? I presume that our legislation is in conformity with that of the Community and that 18 years is the minimum age at which someone may be employed on distances beyond 50 km.
If that is so, why cannot we get away from bureaucratic arguments and lay down a regulation that conductors employed on such buses should be 18 years old? That would not be difficult for the Minister. If he accepts Community policy in one respect, why not in another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Discerning Conservative Members and you, Mr. English, as an equally discerning Chairman, will realise that there is not unanimity of view on the issue among the Opposition. Therefore I wish to make an unashamedly personal contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have unbounded admiration for the majority of our conductors and conductresses who are extremely good at their job. Of course that does not apply to all, but we have many conductors possibly more than we deserve, given the low pay that they receive, who are good at their job. When one travels with such people, it becomes a pleasure to use public transport. They have an uncanny ability to employ a little intelligent anticipation and a few kind words in avoiding all sorts of trouble, which helps to make the journey smooth and pleasant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other conductors do not have that ability, and travelling on their buses can be anything but a pleasant experience. In fact, I have often been glad to get off buses because there have been rows and difficulties, and the journey has been an uncomfortable embarrassment. I can detect the difference, and therefore I am not in a position to say that the quality control involved in the licensing of conductors at present ensures the sort of bus conductors that I should like to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I must consider before voting for or against the clause whether getting rid of the requirement will do anything to further the cause of the sort of quality control that I wish to see, or whether it will be reduced. On balance—and I admit that it is an argument of balance—I believe that such quality control as has been established would tend to be undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1469</span>
There is an element of authority vested in the badge. People who have to apply for that badge, and who may be in danger of losing it—and therefore the job that goes with it—are themselves influenced by its possession. It is significant that one of my hon. Friends displays such a badge, which I assume he once was qualified to wear and, indeed, may still be entitled to wear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this argument, age is not the vital issue. Although I take the points made about the desirability of employing people over 18 years rather than under that age, I do not argue that it is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While in general I go along with those who say that it is better that a badge be given to those over 18, I believe that an element of discretion could be exercised—given that the person in question is capable of doing the job well. On the other hand, the knowledge that someone can be identified as having a fairly serious responsibility tends to add to his authority. It is not merely a matter of whether there is a pleasant or unpleasant journey. In certain emergency conditions there is a responsibility for the safety of passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can more readily call on a conductor to exercise that responsibility if he is under a licensing system. In some cases, there is a responsibility for saying whether the bus stops or goes, which is of some importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also considerations concerning public safeguards. Frankly, I am not impressed by the Parliamentary Secretary's argument that only 12 applications have been turned down out of 30,000. It reminds me of something that I was once told in a motor cycle factory. I saw a man tapping each motor cycle frame that went by, and listening to the ringing noise that it made. When I asked why that was done, I was told that it was a check—a quality control. I questioned whether he had ever failed to pass a frame because he did not like the sound and was told that that had never happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When asked why the man was kept at the task, the manager told me that he was convinced that if there were a flaw in either the tubing or in the brazing of the tubing to the lugs the man would be able to detect it by the way that the frame rang. For all I know, he may have saved a dozen lives or none at all, but he was
	<span class='label label-info column'>1470</span>
there to exercise a degree of quality control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those taking the applications have turned down 12, they have also exercised a degree of quality control. Who knows what any of those 12, had they been licensed to work on buses, may have done or failed to do in their duties of safeguarding the public? The issue is important in that sense. Even if the bus company were well managed, with the latest buses, with a good schedule to maintain and the best drivers, it could still fail in its ultimate objective without some degree of authority being vested in its conductors which was recognised by the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a final point that stems from what has been revealed about the 31¼mile distance, which is equivalent to 50 km. Without any great belief that I shall be making any general improvement to the Bill, I suggest to the Minister that the simplest way of dealing with the matter would be to change the distance limits for express services to 31^ miles rather than 30 miles. It will then become immediately apparent that using an EEC regulation distance for that purpose will also give rise to a common limit in respect of whether a conductor is required to be 18 years or over. That would kill two birds with one stone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister whether he will give an assurance that the protective legislation regulating the employment of young people will not be altered to suit road traffic operators? Conductors can work long hours at a stretch on early morning late night or even all-night services. Is it the Minister's intention to allow young people to work those long hours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point first. The Bill changes only the licensing arrangements for employment and the minimum age of employment. It does not override other legislation on employment that is designed to protect young people against particular forms of work. Where legislation is applicable to young people, on hours, or the employment of school children, for example, there is no question of any provisions of this Bill overriding it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make clear precisely what the law will be, given that we are left with the EEC regulation. The Bill removes any reference to licensing or minimum ages,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1471</span>
but it does not repeal another piece of legislation that remains binding upon us— EEC regulation 543/69. That is directly applicable and can be removed only by the Community. It has been amended to some extent, but not in this respect. The relevant terms under section 3, article 5.3 state that the minimum age for drivers' mates and conductors shall be 18 years. That applies to all journeys within the Community. The only exemption is on regular services of not more than 50 km. In this country we almost always have conductors only on regular services of less than 50 km.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did they do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea. It was done 10 years ago. I have not considered it, but off the cuff I think that if we did not have it, we should not contemplate introducing it, or urging it upon the Community. It is lost in the mists of time of European politics. The Government see no sensible reason for it, but it is law and we are not proposing to change it in the Bill. We could not change it except by agreement within the Community through the ordinary procedures. As it appears to have no practical effect on any service in this country that we can think of, because we do not employ conductors on services of more than 50 km, it is not a matter of great importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am considering an unusual procedural point: whether if part of the law of the land is utterly irrelevant, it is an irrelevance, in procedural terms, to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It bears some faint, though academic, relevance to the Bill, Mr. English, but I think that we all accept that it will have no practical bearing on bus operations in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the conductor will not vanish in this country. There has been a tendency to believe that he will. The new bus grant was introduced in order to speed up the changeover to one-man operating. But operators are entitled to continue to employ conductors where they think that that improves their services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there is an excellent, small, independent operator, called the South Notts Bus Company. It is unusual in various respects. It runs stage carriage services and makes money out of them. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>1472</span>
had not, until recently, increased its fares for five years, except on routes that it shared with operators who used the fare control system to force it to increase its fares when it would not otherwise have done so. It still carries the volume of passengers that it had over 10 years ago and runs crowded buses backwards and forwards to Loughborough. It attracts passengers by its low-fare policy and its punctuality. It insists on employing conductors on all its buses to avoid delays in picking up at bus stops and to enable its buses to run to schedule. The present manager of the company assured me recently that it would not contemplate taking conductors off its buses. It is also in no way a cowboy company, but is highly reputable and highly regarded by its customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is controlled by the commissioners—that is the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Control by the commissioners has merely had the effect of driving up fares, for which increases the company would not otherwise have applied. The company is also not vulnerable to competition as it maintains a low-cost service. As far as I am aware no one is thinking of moving in on its service and undercutting its low fares, which are dramatically lower than those of the neighbouring nationalised and municipal operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that aside, I concede a continuing role for conductors on some services. I cannot concede any possibility of the Government having to licence all these people. There are many responsible jobs done by people of all ages in this country which bring them in contact with the public and which do not call for a formal application to a commissioner and a licensing system. The scale of work involved for commissioners is out of all proportion to the role they play. In practice, of these thousands of licence applications the vast majority are passed more or less on the nod and become a meaningless ritual. The purpose of the Bill is to get rid of the unnecessary licensing which has been in the system for far too long. I have listened to the arguments with care, but the Government remain firmly committed to clause 29 and the abolition of conductor licensing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In any case, they would be notionally unstarred within 20 minutes—when the Committee rises—even if they had been legitimately starred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 122 is a small technical amendment to make up for an accidental omission in the power to charge fees. It was discovered when checking the Bill that we had omitted the power to charge for applications for the issue of documents required for PSVs registered in Great Britain making journeys outside the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 287 is slightly more significant in that it corrects the present tortuous drafting and makes clearer that the commissioners are definitely to have a power to refuse to issue a licence, or to deal with whatever other application has been made, if the fee has not been paid. The amendment provides for such a power in clear language. There is no requirement, but the commissioners will have, as common sense demands they should, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1474</span>
power to refuse to issue a licence or to deal with an application until the appropriate fee has been paid. No doubt they would do so when they had reason to believe that the fee might not be forthcoming if they dealt with the application too promptly. Obviously, if there is a fee-charging requirement it is prudent to back it up with these sorts of powers, and I hope that amendment No. 287 makes these powers much clearer than does the original wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary has acknowledged the parentage of amendment No. 122. We have this abandoned orphan on our Amendment Paper and that gives me an opportunity to press a detailed question relating to amendment No. 122.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we need to know the circumstances in which documents are to be issued and charged for under subparagraph (iv) which would be added to subsection (1). Am I right in believing that the documents will be issued in respect of vehicles which in any case are registered as public service vehicles or are subject to being defined as such? Therefore, is the definition of a public service vehicle within our legislation not of itself sufficient to enable that vehicle to operate abroad for the very same purpose? I appreciate that other operating requirements come to bear but if that is so, is that a general practice within the Community or is it an international requirement for operating buses in all countries? If somebody brings German, French or Italian buses into this country are those buses required to have a document issued by their Governments under a similar provision to that in amendment No. 122, and what purpose does that serve? Does that serve anything more than to tell the authorities of the country into which the bus enters that it is covered by the PSV regulations of the country which it left? That is my first
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1475</span>
detailed question relating to amendment No. 122.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to amendment No. 287. I agree wholeheartedly with the Parliamentary Secretary's description of the wording of part of the clause as tortuous. I believe that some of that is tortuous in the extreme, particularly subsection (1A) and I attempted to improve upon that with an amendment that was not selected. However, allowing that to be the case, I understood that the clause was intended to achieve the purpose of the amendment. Am I wrong in that? Is not the clause as drafted intended to enable the Minister to ensure by regulations that the first fee payment shall be collected where fees are paid by instalments before the document applied for is issued? Why not? Is not that already the clear intention of subsection (1A), or is this merely a clearer way of stating that same intention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the intention of the amendment is to provide only for that, will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the Committee which documents we are talking about? The clause, of course, covers a wide range of documents—PSV licences, operators' licences, initial certificates of fitness and so on. Is a problem being experienced by his Department in getting payment out of people for such documents? If not it would seem to be a rather strange requirement. Normally, I suppose that when applying for documents one remits the appropriate fee which is returned in the event of the application not being in order. Are we to assume from the amendment that a particular problem faces the Ministry of Transport? Is it intended to apply this provision to all documents, or only those where the payment is by instalments? If it is the latter, it would be to the advantage of the Committee if the Minister indicated which documents will be paid for by instalments and which by an initial direct fee on the granting of the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Government have tabled amendment No. 287. It shows that the long and arduous work of the Opposition is beginning to bear fruit. The Government themselves are now trying to make sense of the Bill. Without amendment No. 287 there would be a great deal of reference to fees in the Bill but no deterrent for those who wished to avoid paying them. It has been to the Government's advantage that the Committee has taken so long to reach this point. It has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1476</span>
given them time to think. I hope that from now on they will take the time to think and to make sense of their own Bill. I think that we have done well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This also calls to mind the principle enunciated by the Minister that we should not spend much time on non-controversial clauses. Here is another good reason why we have done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend bears out my point. Had we not spent that time and forced the Government to have another look at the Bill they might well never have discovered that a fee was to be charged but that no one would worry if it were not actually collected. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to ask the Minister a technical question about the clause. He seems to have provided a complete deterrent for non-payment of fees. But there is one slight loophole. I shall briefly describe what I mean. I am sure that the Minister will have an answer. What happens if someone pays the first instalment and gets the licence, as the clause stipulates, but does not bother to pay the remaining instalments? If we did not sit this afternoon, and the Minister went away and looked at this again he might well be able to close the loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the question raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). He asked whether the Department was having a great deal of trouble with non-payment of fees at present. I am informed that we are not having particular trouble, although of course there are some cases of unpaid fees. At present the powers of the commissioners to refuse to deal with applications where there are unpaid fees are, in theory at least, questionable. The amendment will make it clear that they could deal with the problem by refusing to handle applications until the fee has been paid. If the cowboys described by the hon. Member for Newcastle, Central (Mr. Cowans) suddenly entered the field in large numbers perhaps it would be useful for the commissioners to have that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister envisage that happening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but there is such a fear of cowboys on the part of the indians

	<span class='label label-info column'>1477</span>
from the North-East that whenever I have the opportunity to reassure the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) I am delighted to be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 287 attempts to achieve precisely the same object as did the original wording. All those who have spoken agree that, unfortunately, the original wording was somewhat obscure. We are making a drafting change only. The original Bill attempted to deal with the problem by saying that even where the fee or first instalment had not been paid the commissioners could still issue the licence if they so wished. We have now put that the other way round and given the commissioners a straightforward power to refuse to issue a licence when the fee or first instalment has not been paid. I think that we are all agreed on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central asked what happens when someone pays the first instalment but does not pay the rest of the fee. I can only say that is a good question. We assume, of course, that that will not happen in the reputable business of passenger transport provision. I shall explore whether there is a possibility of dealing with the unlikely case of someone who fails to pay the major instalments. The chances of anyone who failed to pay instalments having future applications granted with would be greatly reduced. But as it stands the Bill does not expressly cover the situation where subsequent instalments are not paid. The hon. Gentleman has discovered a loophole which T am sure no one would use. I hope that it was not his intention to explain it to people, otherwise he would have a lot to answer for because of loss of revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the need for instalments—this is more a clause stand part argument—the clause gives much more flexibility as to the kind of fees that may be charged. Oh some applications the fees might, quite properly, be substantial. If an operator's licence fees were related to the number of vehicles he had, there could be quite a substantial bill. Therefore, we can envisage circumstances in which it might be appropriate to make fees payable by instalments. The final decision on what level of fees will be for each vehicle or whether they will be payable by instalments is, of course, reserved for regulations. That must be so, in order to allow some flexibility and save endless legislation
	<span class='label label-info column'>1478</span>
each time inflation takes the level of fees a little higher.

The amendments are purely technical and drafting proposals. The hon.
