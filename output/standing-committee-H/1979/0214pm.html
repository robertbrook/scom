	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering also the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 280, in page 33, leave out lines 1 and 2 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'which shall be deemed—
	<ol>
	<li>to be formed under the Companies Act 1948 and to be registered thereunder; and</li>
	<li>to be a company limited by shares all of which on the appointed day will be owned by the Crown".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 300, in page 33, line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) The successor company shall not be a company existing prior to the transfer of the assets of the National Freight Corporation. The sole assets of the company at the time of its formation shall be the assets of the National Freight Corporation transferred to it by the Minister. The successor company shall not be a subsidiary of any other company.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 299, in page 33, line 15, leave out "The Minister may" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before transferring the assets of the National Freight Corporation by the provisions of this section the Minister shall".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the welcome intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary just before the Committee rose, I believe that we are on the verge of making another improvement to the Bill. When one thinks of the improvements that can be made, even to measures about which we bitterly disagree, the imagination
	<span class='label label-info column'>1592</span>
boggles to think what we could do if we were agreed on the principles of some legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary accepts in principle that the clause should be clear and unambiguous in its intention to transfer the assets of the National Freight Corporation to a company that exists only for that purpose. It will be charged solely with the duty of dealing with the corporation's assets and be connected with no other company. In particular I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm that the legal meaning of the clause is that the company could not be a subsidiary of any other. I take it that that would follow from the definition of "company" in the Companies Act 1948. But I make no claim to any expertise about that, and I believe that it would be valuable to the Committee for the Parliamentary Secretary to put the point on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the principle in the group of amendments, I should like to know why he accepts amendment No. 279 rather than the others. One of those, amendment No. 280, spells out the issue in a way that seems to put matters beyond the shadow of a doubt. It states that the company would be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"formed under the Companies Act 1948"</p></blockquote>
and would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a company limited by shares all of which on the appointed day will be owned by the Crown".</p></blockquote>
No further explanation is needed of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 300 covers the specific question that I raised about the company's sole assets being those of the National Freight Corporation. But amendment No. 299 raises an additional issue as well as ensuring that the company is created specifically for taking over the shares. That matter concerns the option that appears in the first line of subsection (5), which states that the Minister may, by order, set up the company to acquire the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should that option exist? I hope that it is to give the Minister a chance for further reflection, and that he may not decide to take the course set out. Wisdom might prevail and the assets may be left in a different form. But that may be hope prevailing over judgment based on what has happened in the Committee proceedings until now. Why should there be that option, given the declared intention to conduct the exercise as proposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1593</span>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>[Mr. Kenneth Clarke]</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can persuade the right hon. Gentleman that only amendment No. 279 would be acceptable. I have already declared the policy of forming a company especially for our purpose, whose only assets will be all the assets of the National Freight Corporation and whose only shareholder will be the Minister or nominees who will hold the Companies Act company shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 279 makes it clear that the company will be formed for that purpose in order to avoid the possible suggestion that it might be some other company to which the assets are transferred. My hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) during the lunchtime adjournment pointed out to me that it is rather a belt and braces change. Subsection (5) makes it clear that whether this company is nominated or formed for the purpose, it must be 100 per cent. Government owned. There are not many existing companies which the Minister could nominate with 100 per cent. Government shareholdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of good will and cooperation abounding on some issues I am able to give an absolute assurance that the Bill will bind the Government to the policy we are enunciating, and will therefore bind all our successors. We therefore accept amendment No. 279.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be necessary eventually to have consequential amendments to subsection (5) which uses the word "nominate" and I undertake that the Government will bring those forward. I trust that as the Government have accepted an Opposition amendment, consequential Government amendments will not cause unnecessary delay at Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the other amendments are aimed at material points, but amendment No. 280 describes the form of the company as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"formed under the Companies Act 1948 and registered thereunder".</p></blockquote>
It undoubtedly will be, and it is unnecessary to spell that out. We are not thinking of going for any other sort of company. The company will have articles of association following Table A of the Companies Act. The share ownership is already covered by subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) and I think that we agreed not to accept amendments which write in unnecessary words. There is no loophole
	<span class='label label-info column'>1594</span>
in the Bill for the Opposition to close with amendment No. 280.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 300 has been dealt with. Because the company has to be formed for the purpose, it cannot be a company existing prior to the transfer of the assets. As it is formed for the purpose, its sole assets will be the assets of the National Freight Corporation. It cannot be a subsidiary of any other company because of the requirement that all the issued shares of the company—the entire share capital—must be held by the Minister or his nominees. If it were a subsidiary company, it would be partly owned, at least, by some other company. But this will be a wholly-owned company and therefore, 	<i>per se,</i> it is not a subsidiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 299 deals with the apparent discretion given to the Minister in subsection (5). The powers are indeed permissive and not mandatory, but that is normal in this sort of Bill. They also enable the Minister to proceed as described there, but not in any other way. Therefore, the only alternative to the policy I have described is for the Minister not to do anything at and not to proceed with our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly that is not the hon. Gentleman's fear. There is no question of that provision being interpreted as meaning that the Minister may decide by order to transfer the company in some totally different way to some other company. I am assured that that would not bear that interpretation. The only options open to the Minister as the Bill stands would be to proceed to transfer to a wholly-owned Companies Act 1948 company, as described, or not to transfer the assets to any company at all but to allow it to continue as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that by accepting amendment No. 279 the wording confines the Minister and any successor Ministers precisely to the policy that has been described. Although I realise that that policy itself is not acceptable to the Opposition, nevertheless, I am sure that they prefer the Bill as it stands to one that might give a wider discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 271, in page 33, line 4, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Treasury".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0867">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 273, in clause 37, page 33, line 37, leave out subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>No. 272, in clause 37, page 33, line 39, leave out subsection (4).</p>
	<p>No. 274, in clause 39, page 35, line 6, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Treasury".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are directed very much to the villain of the piece—the Treasury. It is a common villain among parliamentarians, perhaps for some good reason. I do not doubt the Treasury's ability to contribute most profoundly to the financial understandings of some problems and I think that it has an extremely difficult job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know what will happen when the judgments exercised by the Treasury conflicts with the judgment of the Department of Transport. In the areas to which the probing amendments are addressed it seems clear that Treasury consent will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 271 refers to subsection (2) which is concerned with the appointed day for the setting up of the company. Nothing can happen without the "consent of the Treasury". Our amendment seeks to remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 273 to clause 37, which is concerned with the initial Government holding in the successor company, seeks to remove subsection (3) which says that the Minister shall not give any directions in regard to the shares without the consent of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 272 to clause 37 relates to a similar condition which applies to securities. Amendment No. 274 to clause 39 concerns a similar check or control regarding the dissolution of the corporation and the statement of its assets due to be published for the successor company. No action can be taken here in regard to form or content without the approval of the Treasury. The amendment seeks to delete the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the approval of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
I suspect that that is not unique. As financial matters are involved it is probably necessary that the Treasury inevitably will have the final say—the veto—and that would apply to Governments of either complexion. No doubt constant arguments
	<span class='label label-info column'>1596</span>
go on between different Departments about that priority, but the essential principle remains the same for Governments of both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to question the Treasury's judgment in areas of commercial policy decisions. For example, the Government have made clear that when they were considering the denationalisation of this company and the setting up of a Companies Act company, there were statements about how that could be achieved from "The Right Track" when the BP solution was mooted as a possibility, to the solution in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of interest to me is the statement of the Government's policy—although it is not stated in the Bill—that they intend to keep a proportion of the shares. We have heard the words "substantial"—I notice that in other denationalisation Bills there is a desire to keep a certain proportion in order to prevent foreign ownership. That may be a judgment based on the importance of the company—I can readily recognise that. Perhaps the Minister has had second thoughts and is saying that he has decided how many will be sold. That is an entirely different proposition from that which the unions thought was the case, namely that a majority of the shares would be held by the Minister. The Minister has made clear that he now meant "substantial". I do not know whether there has been any movement from that, and I may be under a misapprehension. But perhaps for the Committee's benefit the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us his thinking in respect of the matter of holding shares. That is a cardinal point concerning our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a certain number of shares are to be held by the Government in this Companies Act company, there will come a stage at which judgments will be made by shareholders who may be in the minority but collectively may constitute the majority. My point is that it is only necessary for the Government to hold some shares, and that would give them the same right as any shareholder to exercise a commercial decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is particularly important to the argument about share proportions and pension obligations, to which we shall come later. But the short and simple point is that if there is to be a Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1597</span>
shareholding do they intend to appoint any directors, and if so will the Treasury have a say in that? As I understand the matter, the Minister promised a TUC Committee that he would give an indication about the criteria covering the appointment of directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seemed to suggest that there may be Government influence in the matter, either through stage one of the Companies Act company or perhaps at a later stage when it becomes a wholly-owned private company, in the sense that the shares have been sold to the public and not totally held by nominees or the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government own shares do they and the Treasury intend to act as investors in the interest of maintaining their best value? That would seem to mean that a commercial judgment is to be exercised by the Treasury, which may be entirely contrary to a statement made by the Minister—and which would presumably be made in the prospectus—that there would be no interference in the company's commercial decisions. If the Government were prepared to intervene in any of the actions of the new National Freight Company that would be an important point to any prospective buyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a possibility of the Treasury—naturally motivated by the best interest of the taxpayer—seeking to interfere commercially in the company to achieve the best possible terms and advantages in view of the Government shareholding, exactly as any other institutional investor would? That would be at conflict with what I understood to be the Ministry's position—namely, that it intended to retain a certain number of shares and promised not to interfere in the company's commercial decisions. That would seem to put the Government in a quandary and I look forward to hearing from the Parliamentary Secretary about the role of the Treasury and the Minister of Transport. The amendments basically are probing, to establish the Government's thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to spend only a few minutes on this matter because it is fairly clear-cut. I should like to endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) said. He has moved a probing amendment concerning what I believe to be some important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1598</span>
All the amendments are of a piece in that they seek to omit the references to Treasury advice and consent, but that is purely to get the issue discussed and to try to unravel the relationship between the Treasury and the Minister of Transport in respect of financial matters that inevitably form part and parcel of the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traditionally the Opposition have had no love for the Treasury. But there are Members on both sides of the House who aspire to the Treasury award for orthodoxy above and beyond the call of duty. Indeed, a number already have that decoration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the financial transactions that will be carried out, will the Treasury perform its normal function of guarding the public purse? If so, how will it do that? What type of advice will be sought and what will probably be given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debated the last amendment about extinguishing the capital debt and loans that have arisen it was quite evident to me that the Ministry of Transport is falling down in its responsibility as guardian of the public purse. If that is so, a stiffener from the Treasury is urgently needed. I have always regarded the Treasury as a Scrooge but in this instance I would rather vote for a Scrooge with the public purse than for a Rake's Progress. It strikes me that there is an element of that in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also began to have second thoughts about the amendment. I know that it is out of order for me to speak against an amendment to which I have added my name. But at least I can dwell on some of the factors that add up in the balance of the amendment. I thought that Treasury interference would put a straitjacket on the Minister's flexibility, and that it would restrict his initiative. Having read the clause, I take the view that the more that the Minister's initiative is restricted the better. When the share issue is floated—if I may put it in that way—I am not a financial man—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am profoundly glad of that fact, too. I do not have the jargon at my fingerprints. However, I understand that a merchant bank will manage that flotation. Therefore a number of calculations must be made. First, there is the state of market. Second, I assume that the shares will have to be underwritten for some amount, so that if they are not sold
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1599</span>
that underwriting will come into effect. Presumably the proportions will have been agreed beforehand between the Minister and the merchant bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what sort of discussions are likely to go on about judging the market? Will there be a judgment from the Treasury about market conditions or will that calculation be left to the men of the City in the expensive, sharp pin-striped suits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, I accept that in this world power is where the money is. Therefore the Treasury is likely to have a predominant say in whatever the Ministry of Transport does, irrespective of whether it is written into the Bill. That is the law of political existence. I should be very pleased if the Parliamentary Secretary could clear up those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friends have been very kind in the way that they have pursued their inquiries and I shall try to continue in the same vein. But it seems surprising to me that, given the commitment of the present Ministers to the proposition contained in this part of the Bill, we should find it littered with checks, safeguards and vetoes vested in the hands of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is very becoming to the Ministers to be put in the position of having to trot round to the Treasury before they can take decisions about a number of important matters. Clearly, we have our argument with them about the advisability of the course that they are pursuing. However, given that that course will be pursued, that should be done on the basis of transport criteria. I can see that in this area there could be a serious conflict between the short-term financial aims of the Treasury and the best contribution that the NFC could make to transport policy, given that it is to be transferred into private hands. It is, of course, a matter of argument between the parties whether that should happen, but for the purpose of the debate on the amendment I shall assume that the House has decided that that transfer will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the sole consideration to be the short-term financial policy of the Government in the year in which the transfer takes place? The policy may be to raise as much revenue as possible in the year. The Minister will, we assume, trot round to the Treasury for its consent. There is no mention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer
	<span class='label label-info column'>1600</span>
or any particular Minister. The only reference is to the great omnipresent body of the Treasury which has to give its consent. The Bill spells that out beyond the shadow of a doubt, but it does not spell out on what grounds the Treasury will say "yea" or "nay".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has spoken of the financial advantages and has said that he is confident that the interests of the present shareholders, namely the British public, will be protected. In effect, he is saying that he will have to be able to sell the shares when he will get the best return on them. That time may come this year, next year, or at some later stage. The Government's view was made clear by Ministers in this morning's debate. It is that the Minister should have the flexibility to operate those criteria and should not be bound as to when he makes the sale. Difficulties will arise on that score from this part of the Bill. Other charges arise from the provisions of the Bill that will have to be met from the sale of the shares. It is difficult to make judgments about that when one does not know when the sale will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment we merely question whether Treasury consent should be required for the purpose. I do not think that it should. While we are probing, we shall be open to persuasion that Treasury consent is needed, but I believe that it would be far better for the Minister to come to the House for parliamentary consent. That is proposed in a later amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the issues have to be decided in the context of transport policy they will be better decided by the Department that can claim to have greater expertise than any other on the subject of transport. That is so, regardless of the basic conflict of view on whether the corporation should remain a public asset or be sold off in circumstances that will maximise the return to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the Ministry of Transport knows everything that is going on in the transport world. That is not a party point—it may be equally true whether the Labour or Conservative Party is in office—but it is an article of my faith in the way that Government Departments work that the Ministry of Transport is likely to know more than the Treasury. Therefore I would rather that the Treasury did not have a veto here. I should, of course, be happy if the Treasury had a veto and exercised it every time the subject came
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1601</span>
up, thus stopping the Minister from carrying through the objectives and purposes of part II of the Bill, but the present Ministers, given the form of their Department, are more competent to take the decisions. Presumably it is their aim that the assets should be transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although these are probing amendments they have a serious intention. It would be better to have a greater power devolved to the Minister. I hope that Government Members will notice that I am arguing for greater powers for their Minister. I have been accused on many other occasions of wishing to restrict him unduly and of saying that democratic power should be vested in Parliament. No doubt on many future occasions those accusations will again be justified, but on this occasion I am saying "Give the Minister more power. Do not subject him to the pressures of Treasury veto."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my right hon. Friend in advocating, not "more power for the Minister" but "less power for the Treasury". That might be a better motto. Even if the four amendments are accepted, the malign influence of the Treasury will still be far too strong. To write its influence into the statute is too much like inviting their interference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Treasury interests appear to be so short term that their effects are an inversion of good housekeeping. For the sake of a short-term gain the Treasury will ruin almost anything. Many hon. Members are probably familiar with Winston Churchill's saying that Treasury Ministers were like inverted Micawbers waiting for something to turn down. But the Treasury is also waiting for something to turn up. It is in the constant position of waiting for something to turn up by way of a windfall that will make life easier for it. However loyally the Parliamentary Secretary may reply, in his heart of hearts he is probably as concerned as we are about the people at the Treasury waiting for something to turn up. They are waiting for a windfall from some part of the capital or revenue funds of the transport industry. We fear that at some stage when they could do with a quick £25 million or so they may suddenly decide that they would like to take that from the National Freight Corporation, the Ministry of Transport or practically any other body connected with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1602</span>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will at least believe that we are sincere in our wish to protect him and his right hon. Friend from the ravages of the Treasury and its Ministers. I hope that he will go along with us in trying to ensure that while they will always be in the background we should not invite them into the foreground by inserting rights of interference into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The offer of the Opposition that my right hon. Friend should be freed from the constraints of his colleagues at the Treasury or even elsewhere is tempting, but I do not believe that in this case such concern for my right hon. Friend's freedom of action is necessary. Nor do I believe that it would be appropriate to act upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contemplates such major steps as reconstituting a nationalised corporation, transferring its assets to a private company and disposing of them in the market. Given the size of the corporation, that is bound to have important implications for the Government's financial policy. It is a matter of course that a requirement for Treasury consent should be put into such Bills. It would be surprising if the requirement were not there. I find an appropriate precedent in the Transport Act 1978. Section 18 (2) of that Act, dealing with grants to the National Freight Corporation, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any grants under this section shall be made on such terms and conditions as the Secretary of State may with the approval of the Treasury determine".</p></blockquote>
It is the practice of all Governments to make such financial decisions with the consent of the Treasury. The provisions in the Bill are neither surprising nor particularly onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lest it be thought that I am saying all this with clenched teeth and that important transport interests really are jeopardised by allowing the Treasury to intervene, I hasten to assure that Committee that that is not the case. Treasury participation will probably invalidate some of the fears expressed in our previous debate. The Opposition may get it wrong, the Government may get it wrong and the merchant bankers who advise the Government may get it wrong, but the Treasury will insist that the aim throughout is to get the maximum possible return to the public purse from the disposal of the corporation. It will try to ensure that there is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1603</span>
unnecessary loss of revenue to the public while it remains a wholly owned company, and also to ensure that it is disposed of on the best possible terms from the public point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also, of course, have to try to judge the best moment for the flotation to produce the best possible return. I think that both sides of the Committee will agree that any other approach would be a squandering of public assets. However, I can assure the Opposition that the eagle eyes of the Treasury will certainly be on any risk of a public asset being disposed of for less than the best possible price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), appropriately chose this amendment to broaden the matter slightly and to consider exactly what role the Government intend to play during the period when the company is a Companies Act company, but wholly owned before it is disposed of, what the role of the Government as a shareholder will be towards the company during that time, and finally, what shareholding, if any, the Government intend to keep after disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, as a wholly-owned Companies Act company, the company will have a board which will probably consist of about 12 to 14 members. We expect that it will have a high proportion of board members with executive responsibilities, the balance of the board being made up by the sort of people, with financial and business experience, whom it is usual to bring in as non-executive board members in such a company. I can reassure the Opposition that there will be no officials from the Department and certainly no Ministers, and there will be a high proportion of executive directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The board of the present corporation includes members appointed from the trade union movement, for reasons which are already well known. Will it be the Government's policy to have appointments from the trade union side to the board of the company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be no guarantee that trade union members will be appointed to the board as of right. There will be no automatic appointments for any outside body. However, as the 100 per cent. shareholder, the Government will clearly have a big say in who should be directors and I undertake to take on board the suggestion
	<span class='label label-info column'>1604</span>
that the board might include someone with trade union experience as a non-executive director during that period. We are certainly not going towards any sort of representative board. It will be the sort of board that a private sector company would expect to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point about control being exercised by the Treasury or anyone else during the interim period before flotation. The company will be free to exercise its commercial judgment in its management and investment policy. Indeed, since the Conservative Government came to power in May last year, the corporation has already been allowed its commercial head in its judgments. We have charged the board—and it is happy to have this responsibility—to act in a fully commercial way and to seek, as I believe the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) quoted earlier, to invest in success and to develop success, to disinvest in failure and to make the most of its opportunities in the highly competitive and difficult transport market in which it operates. It will be our hope, the corporation's hope, and later the company's hope, as it will be in the interests of all those connected with the corporation, that its commercial performance will be good, and that by the time flotation comes, it will have achieved an adequate record, pointing towards recovery in its financial performance, which will make it an attractive investment in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the actual flotation and the level of shareholding, if any, that the Government will retain. We have made it clear throughout—there are no secrets here—that the Government would be disposing of a majority shareholding. The first aim will be to ensure that the company takes on the character of a private sector company, in which the Government are a minority shareholder and which is owned by private investors including, we hope, employees of the company, and which acts in the market place like any other private sector company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the quotations produced by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East. I am not aware of any commitment given by Ministers about the size of the Government holding, if any, that might be retained. It is possible that the Government will maintain a significant holding—we are not dogmatically committed to disposing of every share—and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1605</span>
that we shall choose to retain a minority shareholding, but we want to retain the maximum flexibility and to decide upon that at the time of flotation, to decide what is appropriate, given the needs of the market and the wish of the company itself, and to see what is appropriate for the Government to retain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Ministers in other Committees have been more specific about the sort of shareholding that the Government would retain in other corporations being denationalised in this Session. With respect, the position of the National Freight Corporation is clearly distinguishable from that of British Aerospace and British Airways. British Aerospace has, apart from anything else, important defence implications. It would be a disaster if sections of the aircraft manufacturing industry with defence implications for this country were to fall into the wrong foreign hands or if the Government lost all control over the corporation through disposing of shareholdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Airways operates in an international environment, has overseas obligations and commitments, and it is wholly appropriate for the Government to retain some shareholding in that company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying anything about the disposal of British Aerospace or British Airways as these are matters for which I have no personal responsibility. I am seeking to indicate that the National Freight Corporation is a totally different sort of business. It is a trading company in the entirely non-strategic and basically domestically-rooted business of road haulage, cold storage and waste disposal, with only part of that market being occupied by the nationalised corporation. Therefore, it is largely a commercial judgment, related to what is in the best interests of the corporation, whether the Government should retain a shareholding and, if so, what size it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have probably not produced final clarity, because no final clarity has yet been reached, but I hope that I have indicated the way in which we shall look upon the matter. Certainly, one commitment that we have is to dispose of the majority holding to ensure that this becomes a private sector company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the matter of the board of directors, I was under the impression, although I cannot now find my
	<span class='label label-info column'>1606</span>
source of information, that at present there is a trade union nominee on the board. I thought that that was a statutory requirement for the National Freight Corporation. Will the Parliamentary Secretary confirm that that is the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make inquiries, but my off-the-cuff answer to the hon. Gentleman is that I do not know. I can say that there will be no statutory obligation on the new company to appoint directors from any source. I anticipate that a large proportion of the directors will be executive directors involved in the management of the company, with a range of outside interests and expertise represented among the non-executive directors. The total size of the board will be 12 to 14 members, but beyond that we have not reached the stage of making final decisions. However, I trust that, at this stage, that is an adequate indication of the form of board that we envisage for the new Companies Act company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has argued the justification for the references to Treasury consent in terms of the Treasury having an overall responsibility to protect the public interest and to see that the British taxpayer gets the best return for the sale of his assets at whatever time the Minister seeks to sell them. We earlier established that that has nothing necessarily to do with the date referred to in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary with care when he said that since the Government have been in office they have encouraged—or have certainly not stood in the way of—the present directors of the NFC acting in accordance with their own best commercial judgment. I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a considerable difference between allowing the directors of the NFC to act in accordance with their best commercial judgment when that judgment is tightly circumscribed by the need to pay a fixed rate of return on the capital debt and outstanding loan, and allowing those same directors to use their best commercial judgment when there is no fixed rate of return on capital loan and debt and when there is a large measure of equity public holding. The Government, as the holder of those shares in the public's name, will then be in a different position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1607</span>
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the Minister of Transport's intention to say that in that period, when the whole of the ownership is in the hands of the Government in the form of equity capital, fixed loan stock or a mix of both, he will encourage—or at least not discourage—the directors of the NFC exercising commercial judgment? Their commercial judgment may be that instead of paying interest on the equity stock that the Government holds at anything like the rate paid at present on the loans and debt, the better way to operate commercially would be to pay much less and to use a greater proportion of the trading profit to expand the value of the total NFC asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in an area of hypothesis. It could be argued by a number of those who are charged with running public assets in the form of nationalised industries that it would be advantageous to do just that at various times. If the directors were to act in that way, will the Minister and the Treasury say, "We are the guardians of the public purse and we have to take the judgement on whether it is better to maximise the return on the equity capital now or to hang on for the longer-term total real capital value of the NFC"? Or will they take the view that it is a matter of commercial judgment in which the directors of the NFC are as keen as the Government to make sure that when the shares are floated they get the best possible return on them, see that they are sold for as much above face value as possible and determine the valuation of the company for the purpose of reflecting how far the assets are developed in a way that will maximise a return on them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to go to the heart of the matter of Treasury control. If the Minister says that he cannot answer that question now, but wants time to consider it with his right hon. Friend, I shall understand. I welcomed the way in which he responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and I hope that he will accept that I have asked a fair question in relation to how we safeguard a public asset. There seems little doubt that there is a choice to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a period when the corporation is to be operated by directors who do not have a liability to make the same fixed rate of return on outstanding loan or debt, there is a decision to be made on whether to maximise the return on equity capital or to increase the value of the asset and move
	<span class='label label-info column'>1608</span>
towards getting the best possible valuation at the time of flotation. All those matters have a bearing on how the public are to be repaid for a public asset and on the timing of the payment, which must involve a question of financial policy for the Government in a period of financial policies that have an immediate impact on their attitude towards public assets and public spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to answer those questions. The right hon. Gentleman is dealing with the time between the appointed day when the assets have been transferred and the flotation when the company is operating as a 100 per cent. owned Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make clear that we are not committed by the Bill, or by policy, to the length of that interval. It is a judgment to be made by the Government and the Department, with the consent of the Treasury, as the Bill makes clear, on whether to transfer the assets a long time before the intended flotation or to put off the stage at which a day is appointed for the transfer of the assets until a date shortly before the intended flotation. That is a judgment on which we shall, of course, consult the company, and ultimately the Government will have to decide on the appointed day with the consent of the Treasury, which will also make a financial judgment. But there will be a period of greater or lesser length, between the appointed day when the assets are transferred, and flotation. During that time it will be a 100 per cent. owned company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot emphasise enough that the management will be free to exercise its commercial judgment. As a 100 per cent. proprietor the Government do not intend to step in and seek to substitute its commercial judgment for that of the board. We will seek, as far as possible, to behave as a major prudent institution would do as the 100 per cent. owner of a company. That does not mean that the Government will be careless about what the company does, because we must be prudent with public money and a 100 per cent. shareholder of a company takes a keen interest in its performance. However, that interest is best reflected as an investor seeking to ensure that the commercial performance of the company is the best that can be achieved. The management will be free to exercise its commercial judgments, subject as managements usually are, to the opinion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1609</span>
of the shareholder on how successful that commercial judgment turns out to be. Basically that will be the relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company could face making a choice between distributing profits as a return on the share capital or retaining them in the company and expanding its activities. The balance between distribution and retention is a matter for the 100 per cent. shareholder. The Government would expect to act in consultation with the company and we trust that dividend policy will be agreed between the company and the Government. A company wholly owned by an outside body would expect such matters as its dividend policy to be a matter of interest to the 100 per cent. shareholder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be one special difference which may answer the fears of the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). The Government—that is, the public—will be a 100 per cent. owner of the company, but an owner who has an eye on selling most of that capital interest. Therefore, it will be in the Government's interest to ensure that the use of resources is aimed at making an attractive and profitable sale in the not-too-distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman fears that a greedy shareholder might demand distribution of profits rather than allow sensible capital investments aimed at building up the company I can assure him that the Government will not behave in that way. The Government will want to see the business develop so that the capital value can be realised at its highest level. Any risk of a policy such as that of British Leyland in the bad old days does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to agree dividend policy and similar matters with the board. I do not foresee any conflict of interest between the Government and the Treasury on the one hand and the company on the other about the best use of resources in the comparatively short period leading to flotation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties faced by the National Freight Corporation, when Governments have had to intervene, can probably best be epitomised by the record of National Carriers. Governments have made decisions, because of employment consequences, to give money so that National Carriers could continue against NFC's own commercial judgment. If the company, acting commercially, decided that it wanted to get rid of National
	<span class='label label-info column'>1610</span>
Carriers because it was a drag—though that is not entirely the present situation—would the Government seek to interfere with that commercial judgment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn into any discussion on matters that are essentially for the management of the National Freight Corporation. I have made clear that the Government will not step in to override the commercial judgment of the present management, or continuing management up to flotation, for non-commercial reasons. That is the Government's policy, regardless of the Bill. We have charged the present board with the duty to make its own commercial decisions and to back them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company is succeeding, impressively, in turning the company into a thriving concern and in some areas is expanding in a very difficult market. It is asked to exercise its own commercial judgment and there is no question of Ministers stepping in to control the company's judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 281, in page 33, line 5, at end insert "approved by affirmative order".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 282, in Clause 42, page 38, line 18, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any order made by statutory instrument under this Part of the Act shall require affirmative resolution".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the amendments relate to the denationalisation of the National Freight Corporation and the process of changing its structure and selling the shares, which we consider should be subject to affirmative resolutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for requiring affirmative orders is that the Bill gives enormous discretion to the Minister. Having empowered him to take over the NFC, it leaves virtually the whole future of the organisation, its structure and who is appointed to its board, entirely in his hands. Therefore, we have tabled the amendments to ensure that the House has an opportunity to check how the Minister is discharging his functions. We shall also be able to check on what the Minister said on Second Reading and in Committee—and will no doubt say on Report and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1611</span>
Third Reading—about his intentions in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that when a Minister gives reasons in justification of legislation the House should make sure that the Minister carries out his intentions. So much of the Bill leaves matters to the discretion of the Minister—the letter of the law is limited and the spirit of its interpretation will be all-important—that the House should be looking at how the Minister is interpreting the spirit of the legislation in the light of what he said in getting the statute through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that all, or some, of these matters should be subject to affirmative resolution. If he does not, we shall find a marked contrast in the Bill. The unelected mandarins at the Treasury, whose record in running the British economy is abysmal, will have the right to interfere at every turn in the activities of the Minister, but the elected House of Commons will have no right to look further once the Bill has gone through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the amendment from the viewpoint of the rights of hon. Members and the general duty of the House to supervise what is done in its name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When orders subject to the affirmative resolution procedure are before the House, the nature of the resolution is sometimes such that the debate is somewhat constrained. On the other hand, it is generally part of the tradition of the House that such orders give hon. Members an opportunity to keep an eye on what is happening generally, subject, from time to time, to the assistance of Mr. Speaker, or even his non-assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My notes on one of the matters that we wish to keep an eye on can now bite the dust because the Minister has conceded that the company will be a separate company, established specially for the purpose of running the National Freight Corporation, which is a good thing. However, other matters include the appointment of directors, so that we could be sure that the Minister was not doing anything contrary to the undertakings given by him, over a considerable period, that the conglomerate of the National Freight Corporation will not be broken up and parts sold off while it is in the Minister's possession. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>1612</span>
have only his expressed good intentions. It would be better if the House kept an eye on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also like to make sure that the obligations to the staff of the NFC that are not to be set out in statute will be honoured. It is important to make sure that people who have devoted their lives to an industry should be protected, and that their terms and conditions and pension rights should be safeguarded. That is another aspect which the affirmative resolution procedure would permit us to keep an eye on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also wish to ensure that the shares are disposed of at an appropriate price. Again, there is no restraint. We have heard that the Treasury will make sure that shares are sold to the best advantage of the public purse, but the Treasury's record, both in acquiring and disposing of assets, suggests that there might be hon. Members who would have legitimate comments to make on how it was carrying out that part of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and this point arises from one of the amendments specifically requiring the affirmative resolution procedure, the Minister indicated that he would not expect to start disposing of shares in the new company until it had had time to establish itself and get a track record, albeit a brief one, and that he would not expect to move to the appointed day before 1981. Is that a correct interpretation of what he said on Second Reading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not yet decided. As I said to the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness, we have yet to decide whether we go for the appointed day early, and let it run for quite a time as a Companies Act company before we float, or delay and make the appointed day shortly before the flotation. As regards the track record, as I indicated earlier, it will make no difference. Whether it is the NFC and then briefly a 100 per cent. owned Companies Act company before being sold, and whether the appointed day is soon or after a long gap in between, it will be allowed to behave commercially and, we trust, acquire a worthwhile track record from then on, up to flotation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for making that clear. I have looked at 	<i>Hansard</i> and I see that the Minister said that he did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1613</span>
envisage a sale of shares taking place before 1981, and not that he would not make the first appointed day before 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, with the looming spectre of the Treasury, ever keen on getting its pound of flesh, we should be suspicious of any dilatoriness by the Government in proceeding with this measure, though we should be even more suspicious of any unnatural haste, if I may so describe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Minister is displaying no unnatural haste, because he has not yet got round to drawing up the articles of association of the company, so presumably we can expect a stay of execution there. I do not urge the Government to proceed quickly; in fact I hope that they do not proceed at all, but these are all matters that would be subject to the scrutiny of the House if the affirmative resolution procedure were required before some actions connected with the disposal of the NFC were approved. I hope that Conservative Members who are keen to preserve the rights of the House and of individual Members will support us, because there is no reason why any of the amendments should lead to delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all ought to believe—although some do not—that it is possible, in the course of even the briefest debate on the affirmative resolution procedure, that something sensible, useful, businesslike, and pertinent to the real world might come up which would be of assistance to the Ministry of Transport and the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall never be thought tardy in supporting propositions that strengthen Parliament against the Executive, but I must confess that I am unsure whether the amendments have the same effect or whether the second has a much wider purpose. I am also not sure whether the first amendment is as great a measure of parliamentary control over the Executive as I should like to see. Subject to those sweeping qualifications, I support the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the previous arguments in Committee against the affirmative resolution procedure cannot apply to this debate. It is not a question of littering up the Order Paper with motions each time that new regulations are to be made. Clearly amendment No. 281 is a once-and-for-all operation which would be put to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1614</span>
House only when the appointed day was proposed by the Government. Only in the event of Parliament rejecting that date would the matter come before the House again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is a matter of sufficient importance to warrant our giving careful consideration to how the power might be used by Parliament, because we are taking a preliminary decision for 635 hon. Members and I take that seriously. My hon. Friends have raised issues on which it would be useful to be able to question the Minister, either in the Chamber or in the merits Committee—according to how controversial the appointed day was in the order—when the decision was taken by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be an occasion to raise, for example, the question that we asked earlier today but which cannot be answered now, for reasons that we understand. However, when the Government make their decision, the Minister will, presumably, be able to answer our question, namely whether he was thinking in terms of a considerable gap between the appointed day and the day when the shares are floated, or whether he would immediately float. That is an issue of some importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see the logic of the Parliamentary Secretary's claim that it is unimportant to us whether there is a considerable gap because the company will be allowed to act commercially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my contention that there is all the difference in the world between the directors' acting commercially when they are within that tight limit—when they are circumscribed by having to make a fixed return on capital debt and loan—and their operating commercial criteria without such limitations. Then, possibly, they can take decisions about whether the money that is being earned by National Freight will be used to increase the corporation's future earning capacity, thereby increasing its value—that will be an important way of insuring the public's financial interest and ensuring that when the public asset comes to be sold it will be highly valued—or to fund a short-term payment to the public of the maximum possible dividend on the equity holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two very different circumstances. I contend that the issue is important, and that if the amendment is not passed it may never again be debated in the House of Commons. Is it not worth one and a half hour's parliamentary time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0877">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

for the House to have the opportunity, if the Government propose to nominate the day in highly contentious circumstances, to debate and question the matter? The Government would in no circumstances be called on by the amendment to give more than one and a half hours' parliamentary time to the specific issue. Matters are raised of sufficient interest in terms of financial and transport policy to justify the request on those grounds alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the effects of clause 42, amendment that No. 282 could have at least two different results. First, it could ensure that in the event of our making other amendments that would require statutory instruments, they would automatically be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Secondly, it could merely be a belt and braces way of covering the only reference to a statutory instrument in part II.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that I have not studied part II carefully enough or that I have not looked for references to statutory instruments. If the intention is to apply the affirmative resolution procedure to all statutory instruments it seems to me a laudable amendment, and worthy of support for that reason. But I hope I have made clear that I should welcome the passing of amendment No. 281, even if amendment No. 282 is rejected, as it raises a clear specific issue which is worth one and a half hours' parliamentary time if the Minister takes action under the provisions of the clause in a way that is highly contentious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to explain the intention behind the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). My interpretation is the same as that of the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). Amendment No. 282 goes somewhat wider than amendment No. 281. If that amendment were carried, it would make the two statutory instruments referred to subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. One concerns "the appointed day" in subsection (2), which is the subject of amendment No. 281. The wider amendment would include the nomination order in subsection (5). In fact, they are so closely connected that on the appointed day when the assets are transferred to the nominated company we shall have one once-and-for-all affirmative resolution if the amendments are carried as they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1616</span>
I concede that the second amendment opens up the possibility, as the Committee goes through part II, that if we make various other matters subject to statutory instrument they would all also be made subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That makes me even less inclined to accept the amendment, because it seems that the Committee would be agreeing to an obligation for affirmative resolutions on as yet unknown commitments that we have not yet reached
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I resist the suggestion that it is necessary as a protection for Parliament or the public to have the affirmative resolution procedure operating on either of the statutory instruments that are referred to in clause 36. They amount to one step, which is purely procedural and concerns the appointed day on which the assets are transferred from a nationalised corporation to a wholly-owned company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem to me that any debate that takes place about an appointed day and the nomination of a company could open up any issues that would not already have been adequately canvassed by Parliament and discussed on the Floor of the House and in Committee. We are merely talking about an essential procedural step in the course of pursuing the policy which we hope that Parliament will have approved by passing the legislation. I can see no worthwhile purpose being served by an hour and a half's talking—either in the Chamber or in Committee—about the choice of date or the make-up of the company at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman again touched on what we have already covered—that is, the company's commercial position in the meantime. The course that he seemed to prefer was that if we are to have the policy—with which he does not agree anyway—we should go quickly to an appointed day and then allow a period to elapse during which the company is free of the obligation to pay a fixed-interest return on its capital so as to allow it to get itself into an attractive state for when the day comes for its flotation and sale. That idea has a lot to commend it, because it would enable the company to maximise its capital value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, that is open to the snag that strongly concerned the right hon. Gentleman a few hours ago. During that period we could forgo the £8 million-worth of income a year that we have at the moment. The right hon. Gentleman believes that we should not do that. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1617</span>
a matter of judgment. One could either go for a quick appointed day and 100 per cent. equity flotation, which would abandon immediate revenue income in the hope of maximising a capital gain in the end. Alternatively, one could go quickly to the appointed day, provide fixed-interest convertible loan stock that would be converted at the last minute into equity capital and then make the flotation. As a third choice one could carry on with the corporation until the last possible moment and have a very late appointed day, followed almost immediately by the flotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All one would be doing would be to make a judgment about the necessary balance between some return now on the capital that is locked into the business and getting the best possible return for the taxpayer on the eventual disposal of his capital interest. Those are all matters of commercial financial judgment. They will be discussed with the management. Clearly, in the end there is the matter of the Treasury's financial judgment, with the taxpayer's interest uppermost in its mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 283, in page 33, line 8, leave out from "Corporation" to end of line 9.

This is a probing amendment. The sour grapes are over for today. We are very good at probing. As a result of the Opposition's probing, many changes have taken place. I am sure that the Government have been entertained by our probing, because a lot of good sense has come from it. If the Parliamentary Secretary can satisfactorily answer our points on this, we shall be prepared to consider withdrawing the amendment, but it is necessary to put on record the concern that is felt on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Freight Corporation has a large number of contractual agreements. We are concerned about what the status of those agreements will be when the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1618</span>
I cannot see that a parliamentary debate on the choice of the appointed day or the nomination of the company would be a helpful step in that process, or that Parliament could usefully intervene in the matter. Apart from anything else, if we chose the option of leaving the appointed day until the last possible moment, by the time that we had our debate on the affirmative resolution all the judgments would have been made. It would be far too late for Parliament to express an opinion, except to criticise a judgment that had already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be plenty of opportunities to criticise both the Treasury and the Ministry of Transport, which is answerable to Parliament through its Ministers. They will continue to be answerable for the management and control of those public assets. I suggest to the Committee that no useful purpose would be served by putting in this additional proviso of an affirmative resolution procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>holding company is set up. For example, the corporation has arrangements with British Rail within which a code of practice is laid down. Will that hold good when the holding company takes over? It also has a duty to consult the trade unions. Will those contractual agreements still be valid when the holding company takes over? There is also the important matter of the individuals' contracts of employment. Will those contracts of employment be valid as contractual agreements with the new company?
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>Will the existing contracts of the National Freight Corporation be binding on the holding company? Will its agreements with British Rail and its statutory duty to consult the trade unions also be binding on the new holding company? We wish these matters to be on record. Section 45 of the Transport Act 1968 places a duty upon the NFC to undertake reviews of the affairs of the respective

	<span class='label label-info column'>1619</span>
organisations and to report to the Minister. What will happen to all those agreements when the holding company is set up?
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>I shall not delay the Committee long, but this has particular relevance in relation to the contracts of employment of individual staff. They need to be assured that their present contracts of employment will be valid with the new holding company. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can spell out these matters, which are a source of worry to these people because they do not know exactly what will happen. If the Parliamentary Secretary can take care of those points, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and I would be delighted to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the phrase to which the amendment refers is a necessary legal technicality to ensure that all the property, rights, liabilities and obligations of the corporation will be transferred and that this overrules any terms of those contracts which may seek to make them non-assignable by the corporation. Like the earlier conveyancing point, it saves the corporation having to renegotiate or redraft all its obligations in order to assign them to a successor company. All of them will be handed over, and the company will take over all the rights and all the obligations which arise out of the present contractual arrangements that have been entered into by the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not extend to statutory duties. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) pointed out that the corporation as at present constituted has various duties under the Transport Act 1968. It is intended to make this a private sector company. It is not intended to make it subject to the statutory obligations imposed upon its nationalised predecessor. Most of those obligations are indeed repealed by schedule 9.

	<p>with whom it deals and, most important, its employees. This will ensure that the contracts of employment of the employees are safeguarded. The successor company will take on the full obligations of those contracts of employment in all respects. That means that all of the present terms and conditions will be carried out. It underlines what would be probably be the case in any event under a lot of other legislation. Their redundancy rights and so on would also be protected because they will be treated as having served one continuous period of employment.

	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed,</i> No. 284, in page 33, line 10, leave out subsection (4).—[	<i>Mr. Cowans.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 9.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to confine myself to matters that we have not discussed already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is the basis of the whole of part II of the Bill. It is the basis of the proposal to denationalise, or put back into private ownership, the various parts of the National Freight Corporation. I find the justification put forward for that proposal rather odd. One of the standard reasons of Conservative Members for objecting to public sector undertakings is that they are in a position to exploit their monopoly and that it would be a jolly fine thing if private operators were allowed to come on the scene, compete with them and show what could be done. Part I refers to public sector buses and we are told that it introduces a new and competitive element which will promote efficiency all round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To an extent there is always some value in the argument that a monopoly can promote or lead to inefficiency because of the lack of standards of comparability, but rather oddly, the arguments adduced in favour of the denationalisation of the NFC are that it is not a monopoly. The fact that it is competing is used as a criticism of its existence. The fact that it is a highly competitive and efficient part of the road transport industry seems to carry no weight with Conservative Members who seem dead set on selling it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always attempt to revert to what Conservative Members might regard as holy writ, and in this case I can get no holier than what the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the NFC is not run as some vast over-centralised nationalised industry. The corporation is broken down into a federated structure, and maximum independence is given to the separate companies … the management in the NFC seems genuinely in no way to wish to avoid commercial realities."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman said that the corporation's approach is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to achieve a commercially viable company, to invest in success and to disinvest in failure."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12th May 1976; Vol. 911, c. 587–8.]</p></blockquote>
In other words, it has all the characteristics that we normally ascribe to private sector companies—and that is before it is denationalised. If we want a further indication of the extent to which the NFC is operating in a competitive manner, we should look at National Carriers. We have heard, not necessarily from the Prime
	<span class='label label-info column'>1622</span>
Minister, but certainly from her adulators in the press, that the right hon. Lady is almost obsessive about the efficiency of Marks and Spencer and wishes to introduce a general Marks and Sparks approach to the whole of the public sector, and Sir Derek Rayner has been dragged in to save us all millions of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth noting that goods delivered to Marks and Spencer are divided into two limited categories—refrigerated goods and cartons and boxes. That is how that organisation has simplified its deliveries. National Carriers—the nationalised company, in competition with the rest of the road transport industry—has the contract to deliver the carton and box category. Everything in a carton or box distributed throughout the Marks and Spencer chain has been delivered by National Carriers—and satisfactorily, otherwise it would not have kept the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National Carriers is generally held to be the least successful part of the National Freight Corporation. It has most difficulty, yet that is the company which manages to compete with everyone else and get the plum contract from Marks and Spencer. If we compare that with the other parts of the organisation that are better thought of than National Carriers, it is safe to assume that they too are competitive, as, indeed, the figures show. Moreover, they have all provided a considerable service to the industries that they normally serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other limitation on the NFC's activities is the requirement that it should co-ordinate its activities with British Rail on goods transport. It is safe to say that without that limitation the NFC, and National Carriers in particular, would feel better off because it would not be tied to British Rail. The system is of ultimate advantage both to British Rail and to people who want to send goods on a system that takes them by rail and a short distance by road at the delivery end. Taking away that obligation from the National Freight Corporation, which is what the Bill proposes to do, may be an advantage to the National Freight Corporation, but it will be a disadvantage to British Rail and to all those people who have used that route for delivering their goods. It is also likely to lead to environmental disadvantages, because it is always bound to lead to some marginal increase in the amount of goods carried by road rather than by rail, with all the accompanying environmental disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1623</span>
Another successful and significant aspect of the National Freight Corporation—we must remember that it represents 10 per cent. of the capacity of the road transport industry—is that it has put considerable effort into research on various aspects of road transport concerned with the efficiency of operation, energy saving and efforts to reduce the impact of motor transport on the environment. In relation to the rest of the road transport industry it has put a disproportionate amount of money into research, and it has been of benefit to the private sector in the motor transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility that unless amendments that the Opposition have tabled are accepted, that valuable aspect of the National Freight Corporation will go by the board, because it is not work that a private sector outfit would do voluntarily as it shows no immediate return. The NFC certainly gets no return from the spin-off benefit that goes to the other 90 per cent. in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect about which there seems to be some dispute, but generally speaking the people working for the NFC companies believe that their terms and conditions compare favourably with those in the rest of the industry. They are not always on the top rate for money, but in general, the terms and conditions of employment in the NFC companies are better. They are certainly better than those in some of the really awful cowboy outfits in goods road transport with which everybody is familiar. Anything that promotes their advantage cannot be of much use to anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the clause is that the NFC is to be taken over by the Government, as an interim measure, and later sold. Who is likely to be interested in buying it? Even with the company gift-wrapped with a dowry of a £100 million write-off and the grants that the NFC has been getting and will get, as a public body if one looks at it as a going concern in the freight transport industry it is not a particularly attractive bargain for the investor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members were investing their life savings and considered the National Freight Company as a freight transport organisation, I suspect that they would not look long before they decided not to put their money in it. It is attractive only because of the assets in land and buildings which, even on a 1969 valuation, represent 60 per cent. of the value of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1624</span>
company. If one allows for inflation doubling the value of land since 1969—which everyone would regard as a gross underestimate—there are enormous amounts of unrealised assets in that land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be proved wrong, but it seems that the most likely purchasers of shares in the National Freight Company will be those who have their beady little eyes on that land and wish to realise those assets. The point to be remembered is that the only way in which they can realise those assets is by destroying the NFC, and particularly National Carriers, because it is mainly the depots of National Carriers that are represented in those high land values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is likely that the purchasers will go for those land values, and the only way of realising those values will be to close the depots. If depots are closed those who obtain a service from National Carriers will no longer receive it and those who work for National Carriers will not have jobs in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 3 of the notes of the meeting of the TUC transport industries committee with the Minister of Transport on 19th November 1979 I read that the Minister said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"his impression was that the NFC's employees were looking forward to the challenge of the private sector."</p></blockquote>
I do not know how many employees of the NFC live in the constituency of Sutton Coldfield represented by the Minister of Transport, but there are many in my constituency and I have met a number of them. I have met representatives of people who work for the NFC in various subsidiary companies, but mainly in National Carriers, over the past few months and I do not know one who is looking forward to the challenge of the private sector. Mainly, they see a threat to their jobs—and they are dead right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not likely to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the abominable clause 36, but we can always live in the hope that we shall see some sensible adjustment. However, I doubt that. The other matter about which workers in the industry are bothered is that they are not clear about the organisation that is to become their employer. I find it ironic that on Second Reading the Minister of Transport said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I firmly believe that our proposals will give the corporation a much better deal than it has ever had in public ownership. It will move away from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1625</span>
its unsatisfactory position as a nationalised industry with no clearly defined role or objective."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27the November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1129]</p></blockquote>
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role and objectives of the National Freight Corporation are clearly set out in statutes and in directions and various exhortations been laid down by successive Ministers of Transport. It is fatuous to suggest that the role and objectives of the NFC have not been clear to the management and staff, officials of the Ministry of Transport and to anybody else who had dealings with it. As far as Marks and Spencer was concerned, its role and objective was to get cartons and boxes around the country more efficiently than anybody else, which was why the NFC got the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That aspect has been clear, but what have we got from the Bill? A clearly defined role and objective? We do not even have the articles of association of the company that is to succeed the NFC. We have no idea who is to be on the board, what its functions are to be, or even whether, before it is set up, the Minister will divest himself of some of his holdings in the NFC. We have no idea, and to suggest that the Bill is substituting for a present mish mash some clearly defined role and objective for the NFC is one of the biggest absurdities that I have heard since I have been an hon. Member—and I have heard some fair old absurdities since 3rd May, though I admit that I heard plenty before then and I may even have uttered some. However I do not believe that any of them has come into this category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a pretty efficient outfit representing 10 per cent. of the road freight transport industry, which has competed fairly well, considering all the problems that it and the industry in general have had and the extra contribution that it has made because of being in the public sector. Yet all the 30,000 employees are expected to take off their caps, throw them in the air and jump about in delight at the idea of moving into the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that many employees would not be too jolly about the prospect at the best of times, but they would be, if not happier, at least more satisfied and secure if they had some clear indication of the body that is to employ them and its objectives. If that body is looking for a return on investment
	<span class='label label-info column'>1626</span>
the best return that anybody will be able to get from it will be by stripping its assets in land and virtually closing a substantial part of its functions. That is how the aggressive, money-seeking entrepreneur, looking to maximise his return, can maximise it most quickly and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be failing in our duty if we do not oppose clause 36 root and branch. If it has enough time to work, it will destroy the NFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garry Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to job security in the NFC. I wonder if he has looked at the position in other nationalised industries. If the hon. Gentleman compares the present number of jobs in the National Coal Board or in British Rail with the position when they were nationalised, he will not feel that that should give any great confidence to employees of nationalised industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some ambivalence on the Government Benches on the subject. It is quite clear that there has been a substantial reduction in the number of staff employed by the NFC since it came into existence. I should be the last to deny that. It has been done virtually without any industrial disputes, with the co-operation and agreement of the unions and in the most civilised manner possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we are on the subject, during the Second Reading debate on 27th November the Parliamentary Secretary spoke of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 10-year history of the corporation, which resulted in the reduction of its labour force to about 60 per cent. of its former size and has involved substantial changes in the nature of the business, changes which should have been made quicker and could have been made better, had it been in the private sector."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27th November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1243.]</p></blockquote>
As recently as 27th November, then, the Parliamentary Secretary was saying that the reductions in staff and changes in operation would have happened even more quickly in the private sector. The hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) apparently does not agree with that view. He thinks that jobs have gone more quickly because the corporation is in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having spent a good deal of time talking to and listening to the trade union representatives of people working for the National Freight Corporation, I can say that they feel much happier as they are, in familiar surroundings negotiating in a fairly seemly atmosphere with a board of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1627</span>
directors for whom they have considerable respect. I could be argued, and I am sure that it is argued by some workers in the National Freight Corporation, that the unions have been too co-operative. NFC employees fear the dissolution of the present arrangements for negotiation and consultation which have worked well for both the management and the staff over the past decade. They are extremely fearful of what may happen if an asset stripper comes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to a meeting only last night at which I said that what the Opposition could do in Parliament about the provisions of the Bill was fairly limited as the Government have a large majority. I said that in the end it would be up to the trade unions to look to preserving and enhancing the terms and conditions of staff employed by the NFC. One man very reasonably said, "And how the hell do we do that with a property company that buys in just to strip the assets?" I found it difficult to answer him other than to say that the function of trade unions has always been to attempt in all circumstances to preserve the terms and conditions of their members and to ensure that they have a decent standard of living. But it would have been foolish to pretend that their efforts to do so would be enhanced by the Bill. That is one of the reasons why I am so deeply opposed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the purpose of a clause stand part debate to argue about the clause in terms of important matters of principle that have not previously been covered, and perhaps to reach judgments on them. Therefore I shall not cover matters about which we have already argued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deploy two broad political arguments against the clause. I take what the Government have said about their major economic policy objectives for the NFC at face value. My first argument is that if they want to achieve those objectives there is no need to make all those convoluted changes. Secondly, the line of policy that they are pursuing is a poor one. That is because it contains a basic contradiction and confusion of objectives. I wish briefly to explain those two arguments to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the Government's contention that there are substantial weaknesses in the NFC as it stands. The first has not been touched upon in this debate but was dealt with at length in the debates on the 1978
	<span class='label label-info column'>1628</span>
Act. Here I shall disagree with some of my hon. Friends. It was undoubtedly a good move for British Rail to transfer Freight-liners to the NFC. But it was a policy not without its disadvantages for the NFC. The whole purpose of the 1978 legislation was to have an integrated programme of road and rail transport. Yet as soon as Freightliners were transferred from the National Freight Corporation that principle received a body blow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is all water under the bridge. Its significance for the purpose of my analysis is that that transfer took from the NFC the emphasis on integrated freight transport. The NFC has therefore been left as rather a large road company, which takes about 10 per cent. of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point deals directly with the political impact of the clause. I agree that the NFC is at a fundamental disadvantage, because its capital structure is inflexible. It depends on loans and is burdened with fixed-interest repayments which are not only restricting, but at times a substantial source of instability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a company in the private sector falls on hard times it can simply declare no dividend in a bad year, but the NFC, geared as it is to fixed-interest finance, has to pay interest every year, irrespective of its commercial performance and its relationship with market trends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a built-in disadvantage for a company to need repeated access to the national loans funds, whatever the financial climate determining the rate of interest may be. That disadvantage is structural to the financial framework of the enterprise. Therefore I accept the Government's argument that there must be a fundamental financial reconstruction. But there is no need to have all this rigmarole in order to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a minute. I am quite rightly challenged on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to stop the Government from taking more equity capital into the present framework of the corporation. I have read a series of annual reports and accounts from the National Freight Corporation in which the directors say that they would welcome the intrusion of more equity capital, public dividend capital, or whatever it is called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1629</span>
There is no reason why one cannot retain the present framework, but make the financial structure more flexible so that it can adapt to the needs of the market. It is a strong argument in principle against the clause that for financial and investment flexibility there is no need to depart from the existing framework. The Government's argument is not a financial and managerial one. It is a purely political argument about free enterprise. I shall come to that in a moment, because even in free enterprise terms the clause is confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial $64,000 question is whether the constituent parts of the new successor company will be kept together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me quote some documentary evidence or opinion. I quote from a notice issued by the National Freight Corporation on 15th November 1979:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporation's chairman, Bobbie Lawrence, said today: The decision as regards ownership is a matter for Parliament and the provisions contained in this Bill do not call for changes in the way companies operate, or in the way the NFC is run. They will provide a more flexible method of financing from which the Corporation can benefit. I am delighted that the Corporation is to be kept together to meet the challenges of the eighties."</p></blockquote>
If that is the understanding which the NFC has, presumably with some indication from the Government, we are in a very confused area. Adn as it is the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility to reply to the debate, my question to him is, do the Government intend to keep it together or not? That is a key question for both financial and managerial considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me pursue that argument a couple of steps further. The critical objective is to create a structure which is responsive and commercially adaptive to the needs of the market. In other words, what the Government and the Minister want is commercial psychology and a response to market forces. I understand that, because that is the political shape of the Government. But the NFC, on the Minister's own admission in past debates in the House, already has that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now quote chapter and verse. I quote someone who is a considerable expert on transport matters—the Minister of Transport. I do not indulge in the kind
	<span class='label label-info column'>1630</span>
of debate where I present to the Minister or anyone else what he has said in the past in order to trip him up. But in this context the Minister has been so consistent over the years in paying tribute to the commercial psychology of the National Freight Corporation that I think it worth telling the Committee once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will quote only one source because my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) will give more chapter and verse. In a debate in the House on the National Freight Corporation on 12th May 1976, which is recorded in 	<i>Hansard,</i> the Minister said—this is not out of context and I am willing to answer questions if there is an intervention:
	<br><blockquote><p>" … the NFC is not run as some vast over-centralised nationalised industry. The corporation is broken down into a federated structure, and maximum independence is given to the separate companies."</p></blockquote>
—in other words—to use a rough precis—there is nothing bureaucratically top heavy about it, it is a pretty adaptive kind of enterprise. However, we have heard arguments from Conservative Members in the last days opposing that. Let me quote some more.
	<br><blockquote><p>"My second reason is that the management in the National Freight Corporation seems genuinely in no way to wish to avoid commercial realities."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman continued, when talking of commercial considerations:
	<br><blockquote><p>" … we are, we believe, pushing against an open door, …."</p></blockquote>
And again:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many hon. Members on both sides of the House would like to see the position rationalised into a number of different types of businesses, so that one company might go for the specialised flow of textiles and another for a different specialist area. It is surely the supply of specialised services that is most important..."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12th May 1976; Vol. 911, cc. 587–88–89.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman was paying tribute to the specialised way in which the NFC approached the problem over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. MICHAEL ENGLISH 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The line of that argument is that the Government want a company with more commercial response to the market place. But, in the Minister's own words, the Corporation has had that since its inception anyway, and, indeed, since 1976 there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1631</span>
has been further considerable progress in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But our major argument is that the Minister's whole case is bedevilled by total political confusion. He is confused and he has made a bodge of the clause because he was afraid to go for the free enterprise solution that is basically at the heart of Conservative Party philosophy. He believes in free enterprise, but has not gone for it. That is why it is a bad clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach to the NFC in clause 36 is neither one thing nor the other. My free enterprise analysis of the freight industry is that the average firm is small—five vehicles and fewer. If we took a market view of what the industry should be like, the small firms would predominate. In a sentence, carrying freight is broadly a jobbing business. The NFC, being large, must, in a free enterprise sense, stand out like a sore thumb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister had the courage of his convictions and was going for a free enterprise solution he would break up the NFC, because the natural six of the unit is small. The average firm has five vehicles or fewer. It can be argued that—to use the textbook phrase—small firms predominate because there are no economies of scale. The firm is small because economically there is nothing to be gained by having a large firm. That is the free enterprise argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were consistent, and related his proposals to the natural free enterprise size of the firm in the market, he would have gone for a different solution. We do not yet know whether the corporation is to be broken up, but if a commercial company is to exercise commercial discretion on a matter of profit and loss and is to relate commercial policy to cost, it will be broken up in the end and will come down to the natural size of the unit, which is small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the eulogy that the hon. Gentleman is delivering to the entrepreneurial instinct that keeps most of the road hulage industry going. But surely his argument is somewhat flawed by the existence of other large groups—for example, the Transport Development Group. Admittedly it is not as large as the NFC, but it is a large commercial road hulage concern in the United Kingdom, and surely the existence of that large, successful private enterprise company
	<span class='label label-info column'>1632</span>
defeats the whole of the hon. Gentleman's case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair intervention. There may be factors in the firm that the hon. Gentleman mentioned that keep it to that size. It is profitable, but I do not know much about it. I was saying that, taking the totality of the structure, the average unit is small. As regards the group mentioned by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), I do not think that there is a striking similarity between that and the NFC as at present organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can have a free enterprise solution with the NFC being broken down into smaller units, and the loss-making parts being closed, according to commercial principle. If it is intended that the NFC should be kept at the same size that is not consistent with the Government's principles as defined in transport policy elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause must be opposed, because it is unnecessary and unfair to the public. It lacks the courage of the Minister's own professed conviction. It is confused and, in the final analysis, it is impractical dogma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More and more as we hear speeches from the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) we realise how much we missed when he sat on the Government Benches during the last Government's Transport Bill, and when he, like many of us in this Committee, sat relatively silent. I am sorry that, because he was the Minister's PPS, he was not then able to speak out against the transfer of Freight-liners. Although he voted for that policy, he has now told us that in fact he was in disagreement with the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He is right to say that when his Government removed Freighthners from the National Freight Corporation they undermined the whole argument that it was the great inter-modal transport operator. It was left as a simple road haulage organisation, which contradicted the Labour Party's aim of trying to create an integrated transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Freight Corporation was the jewel in the crown of that policy—in fact, that was all there was of it. By making that transfer they inflicted damage on the policy which some Labour Members even now espouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point made by the hon. Gentleman was that the clause was very convoluted—I think that was his word—clause and a complicated way of going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1633</span>
about matters. He is totally wrong. I have been most impressed by the simplicity of the proposition. Clause 36 and the general philosophy of this part of the Bill present a clear and simple argument. I congratulate my hon. Friend and the Government for putting matters in this way. They have gone further than many of us might have hoped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that, while they disagree with the general policy, the Opposition will want the new free enterprise National Freight company to be successful and to offer greater job opportunities for its employees. That being so, they will want it to start life without any of the debt burdens that have afflicted the present corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That elimination of the outstanding loans to the corporation and of its commencing capital debt is made possible by the clause. The Government are enabled to set up the new company, to eliminate all the past losses, to make it a company that is based on equity capital and then at a given moment to sell it on the market. There could be nothing simpler. That simplicity and the Government's resolve to give the company a good start in life should earn the gratitude of those who are concerned about the future of the company and all its parts. I shall return to that point shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask my hon. Friend about the new company's financial position. It is a technical point but it is of fundamental importance to the marketing strategy. The company has immense accumulated losses, although one would not think so, judging from some of the Opposition's remarks. If carried forward, those tax losses would mean that the new company would not have to pay corporation tax for some years. That would be a helpful factor for the new company. One hopes that before long it will start to make substantial profits and contribute to the Exchequer, instead of—as has so often been the case in the past decade or so—having been a burden on the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can it be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman is challenging my suggestion that the corporation has been a burden on the taxpayer. If he looks at the figures, he will see that some £150 million of taxpayers' money has been put into the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1634</span>
corporation since its inception. He will not find that similar sums have been put into other sections of road haulage, which have contributed to the country's wellbeing by paying taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation has been something of a burden. We know the reasons for that; many have been outlined during the Committee's proceedings. If it is to begin life as a free enterprise company, let us give it a good start. The tax losses could be an immense asset to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I care very much about what happens to the National Freight company. When some years ago we started to examine the corporation in the context of its unhappy financial history, we were presented with a range of options about what should be done. I emphasise that Labour were in power at the time. It was they who publicly costed out the price of closing down certain sections of the National Freight Corporation—such as National Carriers. The major cost was of redundancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the uncertainty which was presented to the work force of National Carriers and other large parts of the National Freight Corporation. When Labour Members talk about uncertainty in the future, it must be stated that many employees have had terrible uncertainty in the past. The Labour Government at that time considered the option of closing parts of the corporation breaking it up and disposing of certain assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I believe that the new deal that is coming forward is a good one for everyone in the NFC. When the hon. Member for Ipswich asks whether all the constituent parts will be kept together, the fact that the answer is "Yes" must be a tremendous step forward. That position has certainly not been guaranteed in the past few years. Of course that cannot be totally guaranteed in the future, whether it is a State concern or a private one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it seems to me that the Government have made clear that it is our intention to keep it together for the time being. If that position should change in the future, that will be because of management decisions, which presumably will be taken as the best way to guarantee the company's viability and the jobs of those who work in it. This is an attractive proposal for the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1635</span>
Of course, it will still face some concern and uncertainty. That is understandable. One cannot expect all who work there to leap in the air with joy and say that it will be a marvellous change. All changes cause worry and uncertainty. However, if I were an employee of the NFC I should be less concerned now than for several years. I would say that there was every chance of the company's achieving considerable commercial success. The hon. Member for Ipswich rightly referred to the credit that has been given to the NFC in recent years for its commercial success.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) appears to be complaining about timing. I shall be brief if that is what he wishes, although I thought he had criticised the fact that I had not spoken very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Both hon. Members seem to be digressing. Would the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) return to the subject of clause stand part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. English. Nevertheless, I shall take the message about brevity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have praised the NFC for its commercial success in recent years. It is only because of such success that the Government can even contemplate the sort of proposition that is now being discussed. But for how long could that commercial success continue if the company remained in a nationalised setting? Certainly, current management is first class and its relationship with the work force has been superb. Without that, the success could not have been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps that is the political division between us. I would say that if one leaves a corporation such as this—which is only a small slice of a highly competitive haulage world—in the nationalised sector, there is no guarantee that in the next few years it would not slide back again into an unhappy financial position. Everything depends on who the Minister decides to appoint as chairman and senior officers. That is a ministerial and political decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be known that ultimately the corporation could turn to the Government and the taxpayer for subsidies if anything went wrong, and that commercial decisions could not be made about closure, disposal or even expansion without political implications. That would be unhealthy. If the corporation is left in the nationalised
	<span class='label label-info column'>1636</span>
sector, before long it will be plunged back into a state of uncertainty and the question of subsidy will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters would have turned full circle and one would then have to start talking about the closure of uneconomic parts and the disposal of even more jobs than would otherwise have been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise again that when I personally went into this in some detail, with a completely open mind, it seemed to me right to reject all the other options and go for a free-standing, highly competitive concern freed from the constraints and shackles of the State. That was not a doctrinaire decision. I believed it to be the best proposition for such a corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and Opposition disagree on doctrinaire grounds, but the proposals were put forward at the time because we believed them to be the best deal for the NFC. Clause 36 makes that possible. It should give great cause for confidence to all those people connected with the industry, that it will be the basis of a very successful corporation in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. I recognise that a number of my hon. Friends wish to speak and I shall try not to rehearse the arguments already put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be some measure of agreement in the Committee. We have heard about the management of the National Freight Corporation, and everyone seems to agree that the corporation is well managed. Moreover, because the NFC is well run it has had a very stabilising effect on the whole industry. Although it has only 10 per cent. of the road haulage business it is the largest single company. Furthermore, the NFC has provided valuable training areas right across the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if there is agreement in the Committee that that is desirable, that the corporation is well run and well organised, why do the Government have this sudden doctrinaire approach to selling off parts of it? I agree that it is consistent with the Government's policy, but when we look at the structure of the NFC we find what it is all about. The NFC is made up of about 50 subsidiary companies, many of which make a profit. That is the area which the Government are chasing and want to hive off. The Minister could have prevented much of the debate by saying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1637</span>
"We give a categorical assurance that we will not split up the NFC", but he has not done so. One can only assume that he has that option in mind. If he can give that assurance can he make it stick? Are we perhaps talking to the wrong person? Will the Treasury decide whether the NFC remains intact? Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no shadow of doubt that clause 36 is the death knell of the NFC. Even if the Minister gave us a personal assurance that the NFC would be retained intact, the power would still be available for the Government to get rid of it completely at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of people will buy the shares? There are no safeguards in the Bill. The NFC will be ripe for the asset stripper. Clause 36 lays down the complete structure of how the greedy can move in on the lucrative part. I see that the Parliamentary Secretary is smiling. But all he has to do is tell us that there is no intention whatsoever to break up the corporation. Perhaps he can show us where that is stated in the Bill, for Ministers, future and present to be bound by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I was smiling. I expect I was evincing some pain at the hon. Gentleman making the asset stripping point again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) will cause needless concern to those who work for the corporation by claiming that asset strippers will move in. His hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) analysed the nature of the NFC's land holdings and pointed out that probably the most valuable land for potential development owned by the corporation is the present premises and depots of National Carriers. But, purely for the sake of argument, anyone who considered that side of the business for property development purposes would find that the value of the land on which those depots stand would be largely absorbed by the redundancy payments necessary in winding up the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no knowledge of anyone looking at the NFC with a view to asset stripping. But an asset stripper would find that such land would be a very bad financial deal. The existence of these people hovering in the background about to swoop on the NFC is a myth conjured up by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1638</span>
Opposition which will cause needless concern to the workers in the corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the Parliamentary Secretary. Clause 36 makes it possible for the speculator and the asset stripper to move in. It makes it desirable for competitors to buy shares in the hope that they can improve their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Denationalisation might sound fine to delegates at a Tory conference. It may get plaudits for those who advocate it. But it will do nothing for transport or for the NFC. Indeed, it will restrict the corporation and it will not be long before we have a smaller National Freight Corporation, and what remains will be supported by the taxpayer after private enterprise has seized those parts which are making a profit. That is exactly what clause 36 is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time is pressing on and we want to draw to a close on this debate. I shall try to address one or two remarks to the essential principles embodied in clause 36. This is an important and crucial clause. It is the denationalisation clause. All the other parts of the Bill spell out how it will be done, but the principle is embodied in clause 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that principle is the major difference between the two sides of the Committee. There is an ideological difference which needs to be spelt out. It is a difference in approach to the whole concept of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are stating their view that the ownership of the National Freight Corporation, born of the 1968 Act, was an idea by which a corporation was given certain obligations to achieve an integrated form of transportation of goods between road and rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligations placed on the corporation in the 1968 Act demonstrate the integrating function that it has to carry out in its operations in relation to road, rail, air, sea or any other aspect of transport. All those obligations are repealed by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the passing of the Bill, it will be a private sector Companies Act company and will have as its criterion profit and commercial judgment. That will be the sole judgment of the company after its establishment on the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that the corporation is already operating
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0889">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1639</span>
on the obligation that commercial judgment should apply. I do not deny that commercial judgment was to some extent imposed upon the corporation by its obligations under the 1968 Act, but it had to be balanced against the obligations placed upon the corporation, which technically it still has, to integrate these important aspects of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle embodied in clause 36 is to move away from network integration, public service and public interest as defined in the 1968 Act to a haulage business of one forn or another in different areas operating solely according to the profit principle. That is the only judgment to be exercised by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are therefore two distinctive changes. The change from public ownership to a private concerm, or a Companies Act company as we have been calling it in this debate, is a fundamental one. Indeed, it is ideological in the sense that our opposition to clause 36 is not based solely upon the argument about whether, as the Government believe, the company will be a better transporter of freight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our motivation is to some extent ideological, in that we believe in controlling the commanding heights of our economy and transportation is but one small part of that. It is part of our argument about controlling parts of the economy. That is a well-known fact. It is no great disclosure, but it is an essential aspect of the difference between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That ideological difference is one of the main points to be borne in mind in our debates. It emerges clearly in relation to clause 36 and the criteria by which we wish to judge the success of a nationalised concern against a private one. There is the question of how its debts and loans are to be dealt with, and how it is to be treated more advantageously than it was when it was under the financial obligations of the nationalised industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also bear in mind the history of the National Freight Corporation. There were the difficulties of the 1978 Act, to which the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) referred, when a similar exercise was conducted. It was agreed by both sides at that time that there should be a reduction in the capital debt. The principle in subsection (4) is to write off the liabilities of loans and commencement debt. In 1978 we were concerned to reduce the debt, although inevitably it involved a reorganisation of the financial obligations
	<span class='label label-info column'>1640</span>
of the National Freight Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about the reduction of obligations raised its head in the argument about the appointed day. The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to suggest that it did not really matter when that day came as there would not be any disadvantage one way or another. But if the appointed day is more than 12 months after enactment, there will be a period in which a loss will have to be taken into account. For example, under the present system, £10 million would be earned by the Government during that period from the debt payments that the corporation would have to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is no longer available to the company and we write off the debts, they will presumably be held either in securities or in what is called convertible fixed-interest stock. The measurement of whether it is more or less profitable will be the return received by the Government on that stock. We know that at present it is £10 million for one year. What will the Government receive on fixed-interest stock? Will it be as much as the 17 per cent. currently paid by the NFC? If it is less, the taxpayer will be that much poorer over the period up to the appointed day. That is one of our arguments about the long lead time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been about the record of the NFC. My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) quoted views of the Minister of Transport on the NFC some years ago. I am pleased to inform my hon. Friend he will find that there has been a considerable turnround in the position of the NFC in those 10 years. The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) was also fair in pointing out that considerable difficulties had been imposed on the NFC. One of the central points on which we found some agreement was when he argued whether companies should be able to apply for public equity as an alternative to the present means of financing the obligations of the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFC has been a major innovator in a number of areas. The hon. Member for Faversham mentioned other large transport operators, but none of those can match the innovating role or research of the NFC, which have been tested and proved by the consumer councils and the Price Commission. As an innovator it has been a successful company and it has been important in integrating transport. We do not believe that the arguments given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0890">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1641</span>
in justification for the proposed action are sufficient for us to support the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's reasons are ideological. Much as we are against the NFC going into the private sector we must recognise that the Government hold a different view. They believe it is a proper political purpose for it to go into private hands. Therefore, we must agree to disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that greater flexibility should be given to the NFC and that that could have been achieved by granting it public dividend status, which both Tory and Labour Governments have refused to State corporations when they have requested it. To place on record why we did not do it in 1978, and the interesting reason given by the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers), was that giving a State corporation public dividend status would put it in a far more advantageous position. That is the point that we want to make and it is the point embodied in the clause—the private company will be given a more advantageous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to develop more points, but as time is short I shall not do so. Perhaps I shall have an opportunity to develop them on Report. One reason against the proposed action that has not emerged too clearly is that the Government will lose £10 million a year and if they sell all the shares the loss will have to be measured against the income that they will receive from those shares. However, the Government are losing out on the possible advantages of the potential in the company. One can only assume that it is a potential asset, otherwise it would not be available for sale to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another ideologically based reason given by the Government is that the transfer will result in a cutback in the public sector borrowing requirement. I can understand that argument, because nationalised industries come within that sector. The proposed sale is one way in which a reduction can be achieved, which is one of the Government's policy objectives with which the Opposition disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the NFC has had a difficult history, it has potential, but it is still required to offer sweeteners to private companies; it is required to write off capital debts and loans and it is required to make favourable arrangements for pensions and concessionary travel, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1642</span>
was the difficulty for the NFC until the changes in 1978. Most of all, it has to repeal the obligations of integration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the clause on ideological grounds. It will undermine the integration aspects of transportation; create greater uncertainty because of the lack of integration and raise the concept of the profit motive over integration and the public interest. The take-over possibilities and the potential for asset stripping are apparently blocked by redundancy payments. I understand what the Parliamentary Secretary means by that, but it is hardly comforting to know that the commercial judgment will be offset by the obligations of redundancy payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause, more than any, is ideologically based and promotes the profit motive at the expense of the consumer and the employees. Furthermore, it will undermine the principle of an integrated transport system which the Opposition believe in and which the National Freight Corporation was designed to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be able to match and, indeed, outdo the hon. Gentleman in economy of time. The political case for the Government has already been well put by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). It was appropriate that he should do so, because he has been involved in the formulation of policy in this area for substantially longer than I have. He was involved in the evolution of policy when we were in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is probably the most political clause in the Bill. It is the denationalisation clause. I do not think that our political divisions have totally obscured the power of both sides to get the proposals in a workable form. We share one aim, which is to try to further the legitimate and genuine interests of the corporation and those who work in it. The difference between us is how best to serve the interests of the corporation, its employees and its customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are basic political positions on which we shall not agree. Certainly the Government have political aims. We intend to reduce the size of the public sector. We intend that the Government should not be involved in activities in which a Government have no part to play. The Ministry's involvement in a haulage business, a cold storage business, a general road haulage business and Pickfords is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1643</span>
historical accident. The interests of the taxpayer are far better served by disposing of these capital assets and taking the NFC out of the public sector altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition also have political aims. We realise that they are committed to the public ownership of the commanding heights of the economy, but I cannot help agreeing with the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) that the National Freight Corporation is hardly a commanding height, and his more ideological right hon. and hon. Friends are prepared to fight for every foothill if they make a great political battle over the nationalised National Freight Corporation. The political aim seems to be restored on the Opposition Benches now that an integrated transport system, which I thought was dead and buried, is now being revived again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend for Faversham pointed out, we thought that the integrated transport policy was abandoned, in effect, in 1978 when Freightliners was transferred from the NFC back to British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me conclude by concentrating on the scope that our proposal has for the corporation and its employees. I believe that they will look upon it as an opportunity and not as a threat and that they have everything to gain by going into the private sector. I cannot see the advantages of being in a nationalised industry if it has potential for profitable trading activity. All investment and management decisions are subject to the risk of political involvement if a particular managerial decision is embarrassing to the Government of the day. All investment, certainly, has to be within the confines of the public sector borrowing requirement and investment ceilings are set by the Treasury. That is a great constraint on a public sector company seeking to expand in certain areas. To go to the private sector is plainly the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that there will be no overnight change in the status of its employees. The National Freight Corporation at present is a holding company, as the new company will be. It will continue to trade through its subsidiaries. I hope that we have reassured many of those who work for those subsidiaries that their contracts of employment will not be threatened and, that the trading position of their company will not change. It will have greater commercial freedom and flexibility to develop
	<span class='label label-info column'>1644</span>
the more successful parts of its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have disposed of the bogey man fear of the asset stripper. So far as I am aware, such activities are not only not contemplated but would not be an attractive paying proposition in a company of this sort. I believe that the company will succeed if its commercial track record continues to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all paid tribute to the company's record in the past few years. Previously it had incurred substantial losses and it is by no means out of the wood yet in becoming a fully competitive company. But it is in a very strong recovery position. We believe that we can time the sale in such a way that it will be an attractive proposition for investors—including, I hope, some who work for the company—who will see its scope for continuing to trade in the freight industry and for expanding and developing the stronger parts of its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even during the run-up to the passing of the proposals in clause 36 we are not inhibiting the company's commercial freedom. As the Opposition know, the corporation is not being stopped by the Government from seeking to move into cold storage business opportunities. It is acquiring a larger stake in that. We see no need to inhibit that. Indeed, the company's investment potential will be greatly improved once it is free of political interference and of the investment constraints that apply to a public sector company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham raised a specific point about tax losses and the position of the new company. He has touched on a very pertinent point to which I am not able to give an instant answer. Certainly, at first blush as the law now stands those tax losses will be carried and be a great attraction in respect of corporation tax liability in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However this is a matter that is still under active consideration by the Government. When the position has been clarified I shall write to my hon. Friend to explain exactly what that will be. But that is just one of the matters that must be considered in preparing the company for sale and return to the private sector. The better the company performs the easier it will be to achieve the right value on the market for the taxpayer and the more secure will be the jobs of those working for the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1645</span>
My hon. Friend underlined the fact that in the past public ownership has been no guarantee whatever of job security or anything else to the corporation's employees. Only successful competition trading can guarantee their jobs and the future of the corporation's successor company. We believe that what we are doing will facilitate the company's recovery and will offer nothing but an attractive potential to its management and work force. Therefore, I commend clause 36 to the Committee and trust that it will be allowed to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
