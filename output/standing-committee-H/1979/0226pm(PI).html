FUNDING OF RELEVANT PENSION OBLIGATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an illuminating debate on the various principles involved. Each clause brings with it a number of significant points. The point on this clause which strikes most, which I welcome, is the fact that if the Minister cannot get enough money to cover his pension obligations, he will not proceed to sell the National Freight Corporation. One hopes that the public will read the report of our proceedings and decide that these pension liabilities may be sufficient to deter them from buying shares in the NFC. Nevertheless, there is a clear onus on the Minister as to responsibility for his judgment and actions if insufficient money should be raised by the flotation of shares and securities of the National Freight Corporation.<br><br>
The essential principles have largely locked themselves around the argument of whether the workers in the road-based sector have the same feeling of security about their pensions under the new arrangements for the private company that will inherit the pensions obligations as they now have under the NFC's pension provisions. It is clear that workers in the industry do have that concern at present.<br><br>
As the Minister has made clear, the obligation to pay the pensions so far negotiated in the industry is in one instance on the NFC, with support from the Government. This applies to the various funding schemes, although not to the road-based schemes. The security will be the payment of approximately £2.25 million, which will, I believe, be made up until the appointed day. It will be done under the obligations of the NFC to meet
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1844</span>
the deficiencies.<br><br>
Our argument has been that we should somehow guarantee the security of the pension funds. The trustees are naturally concerned about the different ways in which the pension will be treated. We are concerned to deal with the very narrow aspect of the debate on pensions. Much of the principle involved will come in the later stages of our debate, especially on part III of the Bill. Here we are largely concerned with the historic pension funds of the road-based sector that were initiated by the old British Transport Commission.<br><br>
One of our main anxieties is that it has been very much the view of Governments of both persuasions up to now that nationalised industries would not be allowed to go bust, that any pension arrangements in those industries would be met on a pay-as-you-go principle, and that, at the end of the day, the Government would always be prepared to meet such obligations. Here the Government seek to change some of the principles governing pensions. We must differentiate between the principle of funding that is associated with some other railway pensions and that which is largely one of responsibility for funding the deficit "as-you-go", so to speak. As the Bill will denationalise the corporation and turn in into a private company, we are concerned about whether the obligation and security will be as great.<br><br>
The Minister has made clear that at least in the transitional period the payments will continue as at present, so there is no reason to feel any concern about that. However, we are worried about whether sufficient money will be raised to meet the first obligation to meet the pension commitment—that is, to finance the fund to an extent that will be determined by the Minister.<br><br>
Clearly, the new company's liabilities will be the same as those of the corporation. But the major difference lies in the security felt by employees of a public corporation and a private company. It may be assumed that, whatever happens to a public corporation, the Government will always maintain the security of its pension funds. Historically, there is plenty of evidence of that. Governments such as the previous Labour Administration have decided to fund the pension obligations of various nationalised industries by capitalising them under certain fund arrange-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1002">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1845</span>
ments which, no doubt, will be mentioned later in the Bill.<br><br>
As the Minister has pointed out in respect of pensions for road-based interests in the National Freight Corporation the same obligations that exist at present would continue. The Government would not guarantee beyond a certain date what was to happen to pension obligations. However, our main concern is that there is a judgment in respect of pension obligations about what will happen once the corporation becomes a private company. The actuarial profession will decide—or judge—the increasing obligation to a pension fund over a period.<br><br>
The Opposition were amused by the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to the inflation rate of the previous Labour Administration, as though that were to be compared unfavourably with that at present, which certainly is a source of concern to pension funds. The judgment will have to apply not just for the next few years but for a longer period.<br><br>
I was somewhat surprised to learn for how long the pension fund would have to be funded. I had assumed, because of its title—"historic"—that there would be only a few years before it went out of existence. But I believe that some people in the fund are only about 30 years of age, which could mean that they will spend another 50 years or so in it.<br><br>
Whatever arrangements are being made to fund it, clearly they will have to last for three or four decades beyond the establishing of the private company, assuming that its status is not changed back into that of a nationalised one. However, leaving that political point aside, clearly there will need to be a considerable period about which judgment will have to be made about inflation rates and the amount of money that will be required.<br><br>
If one examines the problem of inflation—and bears in mind the argument that took place in the Public Accounts Committee—one can see that liabilities on the funds will increase considerably if the rate of inflation is greater than the return on investment. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to that; it is not impossible that it will occur and pose considerable difficulties for all pension funds. The argument does not concern just these funds but all pension funds, and certainly those that are index-linked, as are those with which we are dealing. Clearly, many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1846</span>
people associated with pensions are concerned about what might happen to pensions over the next two or three decades, particularly to those that are index-linked. The rate of inflation raises particular anxiety here. If greater liabilities are likely to devolve on pension funds, it will be a matter of concern to people dependent on those funds that a correct judgment should be made as to what arrangements are the most secure. When such a person looks at what may happen in a private and in a public company, he has some reason to believe that he may be better off under the present system. At this stage at least there is a presumption, although it is not embodied in any legislation, that the Government would meet the pension liabilities should the company go bust or run into financial difficulties. There is plenty of historical evidence for that.<br><br>
Under the last Tory Administration, however, opinions on what could be considered fairly safe were somewhat blown apart by what happened over the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. It was found that in the end certain trust companies or corporations were not to be supported after all. However, that may well have been an exception to the rule—I hope that it was. Most of the evidence is the other way, and appears to suggest that a public corporation is a more secure bet than a private corporation, in that respect. For those dependent on such pensions, that is a most important consideration.<br><br>
Let us take into account what may happen in the case of a private company. No one wishes to see companies go bust, whether they are private or public. It involves a great deal of misery for all concerned. But it does happen. We must acknowledge that the road transport industry is a fairly difficult one in which to operate. The NFC is only just beginning to turn round, as we have all recognised during the course of the debate. It has to operate in a highly competitive industry. Hitherto, it has always had the advantage, to a certain extent, of the Government being prepared to support it—although, as we all agree, it has done a remarkable job of turning itself round over the last decade.<br><br>
What will happen once the company is sold off to the private sector? Let us assume that the Minister's judgment is right. Our amendments at least attempt to guarantee security to the industry—that is, to ensure complete funding should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1003">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1847</span>
liabilities occur later in the handling of the funds. But let us assume that the Minister has made the right judgment as to how much money he should give to the funds. For the first year or so it could turn out that there is no need for the company to meet the liability that it meets at present to the tune of £2.25 million a year. But suppose that then something goes terribly wrong. The Minister will face his obligation as spelt out in the Bill. That extended until the date that he made his decision and floated the shares. His decision would have been tied in to many other variable factors, and over the first year may well have seemed to have been right. He would have to have made judgments about inflation, the rate of return and all the other factors that determine liabilities—such as the level of wages that determines the level of the pensions that are to be paid.<br><br>
If the wages to which pensions are related at the outset were determined at a higher level, that could have had a considerable effect in increasing the liabilities of the fund. The Minister may well get it right at the beginning. Then three, four, five or six years later he will argue that he has no further liability. That was indeed the situation under the Labour Government in connection with funding pension funds until 1986. At the time of that decision there was no obligation on a Labour Government. I presume that they made the situation absolutely clear by saying, "We shall fund you up to that date; after that you are on your own." To apply such a principle to the British rail industry would be fair, the Minister claims. I am bound to say that it is not the same argument, because one is a nationalised industry. However, arguments about those differences should perhaps be left until we discuss part III.<br><br>
For the present I shall follow through my argument about what happens in the case of a private company. If such a company runs into difficulties it may well be in a position where it can attempt to raise more money, and if it fails in that it can begin to sell its assets. I assume that if it sells its assets it also sells its obligations for pensions.<br><br>
The Minister pointed to the example of cold stores, which he feels should never have been taken on by a nationalised industry but which are found to be profitable and sold off to obtain a certain amount of money to meet that sort of liability. Presumably the pension obliga-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1848</span>
tions for the people working in those cold stores would be sold to the successor company, and, therefore, we would not have to worry about a reducing amount of assets having to cover an ever-increasing demand of pension liabilities.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
There is the possibility that, when selling off the assets, we may get down to the rump situation that was the fear of most Governments and the reason why they wanted the NFC kept together. There was a sort of cross-subsidisation in the argument that one carried along less profitable or non-profitable organisations with profitable ones. I believe that was a reason kept in mind by the Minister for keeping the unit together although he cannot guarantee that once it is sold. Once sold, and even if he retained a large proportion of the shares he has made clear to the committee that he would not seek to interfere in any way with the commercial judgment of the company.<br><br>
Therefore, the company can make a decision that it wants to sell off the profitable parts so as to have access to cash and be able to fund some of its pension obligations. But that is a short-term solution and eventually the crunch will come when it has got rid of most of its profitable assets, is down to its less profitable operations, which become more difficult to manage and, therefore, there is the possibility that the company may face bankruptcy.<br><br>
If there is such a bankruptcy, it is fair to assume that the people covered by the pensions would be in a position where, if there were greater deficits on the fund, those obligations would be lost. Will the Minister tell the Committee what will happen to the pension obligations if the company becomes bankrupt? I believe that there may be legislation for the pension obligations to have first claim on the money in that event. But even if that is the case, there may not be sufficient assets to meet the demand of the liabilities of the pension fund.<br><br>
For the purpose of the argument I shall accept that the pension fund will have the first claim on the company's assets, and it may well be the case that at that stage—which is somewhat hypothetical but people covered by pensions will be having to look 10 or 20 years ahead and may assume that the company may get into difficulties—the person covered by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1004">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1849</span>
the pension fund of the company will be worse off than a person covered by that of a public corporation.<br><br>
That is to assume that the Government would step in to do something about a public corporation, but that is not the only point. The higher the level of inflation, given that it is higher than the rate of return, the more will increase the liabilities on the company. We seek to insure against that by saying that if that circumstance occurred the Government would be respnsible. The Minister has made clear that he should not have any obligation, for the same reason given by the Labour Government in 1978. The funding was agreed between all concerned, and the level of funding of the capitalisation of the pensions, which we shall come to later, was found to be agreeable to all the parties concerned.<br><br>
That cannot be said of the present situation, which is why we are being pressed to obtain a similar guarantee for employees who assumed certain conditions about entering the industry and the safety of the pension schemes of a nationalised interest. Therefore, we feel that if the clause is passed a less satisfactory position introduced for employees entering the private sector.<br><br>
My last point deals with subsection (3), which we wanted deleted. The Minister did not insist on carrying our amendment to delete that subsection. We welcome the opportunity to look at the points he made, to have further discussions and perhaps to return to the matter on Report if we are not satisfied.<br><br>
We feel that people covered by the present pension schemes of the NFC are less secure about the pension obligations being switched from the NFC to a private company. However it is to be done, it will certainly not be such a satisfactory position and therefore we shall vote against clause 40 standing part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p>The Minister of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate on this matter and I believe that the points of difference are now reasonably well known. But there are two points which are worth making arising from what was said by the hon. Minister for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott).<br><br>
First, many of the arguments about the reconstruction and funding of obligations were put at the time of the 1978 Act. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1850</span>
1978 Act provided for the funding of the rail-based obligations to the schemes of the NFC, and funding under the Railways Act 1974 was extended to relieve the rail-based obligations relating to British Railways Board schemes. But the decision was made at that stage not to extend it to the road-based obligations, which is what the discussion is about. Certainly, it is fair for right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to criticise that decision, but it is equally fair for us to say that that was an opportunity available to the Labour Administration which was not taken. I understand, of course, that one can make a distinction between the position of a nationalised concern and the one to which we are moving.<br><br>
I believe that the second point is more important, it relates to the amount of security that is available, and whether the same amount of security is as available under the arrangements we propose as is now available to the pensioner and would-be pensioner. The arguments of the Opposition are based upon something of a misconception—that the Government continue to stand behind the pension arrangements of a nationalised industry irrespective of what happens to that pension scheme.<br><br>
If one takes, for example, a nationalised industy's arrangements which we shall be changing in a later stage of the Bill—the Railways Act 1974—it was never the intention that the Government should stand behind that for ever more. It was the intention that a once and for all arrangement should be reached on the funding of that obligation. Obviously, we are changing the arrangement but if it had transpired under the previous arrangements that deficiencies had taken place, such deficiencies would have fallen not on the Government but on the British Railways Board. That was implicit in the arrangements and was one of the reasons that the BRB was not that keen about that aspect of it.<br><br>
I can well understand that a nationalised industry or a pension fund may say that it would like to have regular reviews of the situation, but that was not the arrangement made at the time. I believe that the same argument applies here. The Government do not stand behind these sorts of scheme for ever. Indeed, I think it can be claimed that the arrangement which we are making is better and more secure than the one we have at present.<br><br>
At present, the NFC's road-based pen-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1005">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1851</span>
sion liabilities are discharged by the NFC out of revenue. As the hon. Gentleman said, that accounts for £2.5 million compared with a turnover of £480 million. We have taken the view—and the hon. Gentlman made this point—that it is a different matter when the NFC comes to be moved out of the public sector, and that it would be better, not only from the point of view of the marketability of the corporation but also from that of the people working inside the NFC, that the deficiencies should be funded by the private investors, in effect, rather than by the Government. So we are seeking to collect contributions and pay them over to the pension funds rather than act as a contributor in our own right.<br><br>
I should have thought, whatever other arguments one might have about the general principle of what is being done about moving from the public sector to the private sector, that that arrangement is one which is probably to the benefit rather than the detriment of those people work-</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
MEANING OF "THE RELEVANT PENSION OBLIGATIONS"</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find this clause very difficult to understand. Although I have read it on a number of occasions, I cannot see with any certainty how it achieves what I originally understood it was intended to achieve. It may help to define my question if I explain to the Minister what I thought clause 41 was intended to achieve, namely, to define "the relevant pension obligations" for the purpose of part II of the Bill and the funding provisions of clause 40.<br><br>
I also thought, on my original reading</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1852</span>
<p>ing for the NFC. We have gone over the various points, and the difference between the two sides of the Committee is well known. It is certainly the Government's intention that funding under clause 40 should be sufficient—and I emphasise this—to prevent pension fund deficiencies from being an obstacle to sale, and given that any substantial deficiencies would probably prove to be an obstacle, I hope that this will also be an assurance to the pension scheme members and the pensioners concerned.<br><br></p>
<p>We are concerned with giving the assurance of security, and we believe that the way in which we are doing it in clause 40 is fair and reasonable, and we regret the fact that the Opposition will not be with us on this occasion.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 6.</p>
<p>of the Bill, that clause 44 defined "the relevant pension obligations" for part II, in so far as it dealt with railway pensions, and part III, in so far as it was concerned with British Railways. But it does not do that. It would be much simpler if the Minister could find a way between now and Report of making clear that clause 41 is talking about the NFC's historic road pensions. I should like to explain why I believe that it fails to do that. It might at least give a basis on which to construct an understanding of the clause.<br><br></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p>Subsection (1) sets out the relevant pension obligations. I take it that that means those which are relevant to those that are to be funded under the provisions of clause 40. But subsection (2) states that subsection (1) does not define the relevant pension obligations in so far as it covers anything in subsection (2). That is a difficult, enough form of construction, but one that exists in other legislation.<br><br></p>
<p>I am finally thrown right off the track
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1006">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1853</span>
by subsection (3). which defines the word "pension" as it relates to any of the relevant pension schemes having
<br><blockquote><p>"the same meaning as in part III."</p></blockquote>
Surely a part III relevant pension scheme does not touch on historic road pensions, but on the historic rail pensions.<br><br></p>
<p>Therefore, how does one give the word "pension" in the two subsections the same meaning as in part III without destroying the intention—or have I got it all wrong? Why is not the Bill constructed so that clause 41 defines what is relevant to historic road pensions of the NFC and clause 44 what is relevant to historic rail pensions obligations both of NFC and British Rail? That would seem to have been the initial purpose in the Bill's drafting but it does not seem to have been achieved.<br><br></p>
<p>I have one more point to put about clause 41. It concerns the apparent exclusion of National Carriers Ltd. The clause does not appear to mention the pension obligations attached to that company as a subsidiary—or relevant subsidiary, as it is called in the Bill—of the NFC. Will National Carriers be excluded because all its employees are outwith this category? Would none of them be able to benefit under the funding provisions of clause 40? If so, the matter is reasonably straightforward. But I understand that there are those in the NFC pension funds yet who are, in fact, employed by British Rail under the transfer back of Freightliners, in which case there may be a special category. We may have to come to that matter later.<br><br></p>
<p>However, if the Minister could make clear whether my understanding about the effect of that exclusion is correct and whether its purpose arises from the nature of pensions of the subsidiary's employees, that would help my understanding of clause 41.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman's questions were aimed at clarifying the meaning of the clause for all of us. But the more I listened to him the more I began to have doubts about whether I understood it myself. No doubt after having attempted to answer the questions, I shall understand it more clearly.<br><br>

I begin by taking up the reference to the word "pension" in subsection (3). I suppose that it is an odd place to put it in the Bill. That occurred to me while I was listening to the right hon. Gentleman. It is designed to make sure that in parts II and III of the Bill the word "pension" carries exactly the same meaning. The definition stretches the term from what we ordinarily understand in a colloquial sense to include lump sums, transfer values, return of contributions, death benefits and all the other fringe benefits and attributes of pension schemes.<br><br>
Having agreed that the word "pension" is being used in the same all-embracing sense in parts II and III, I should add that clause 41 aims to identify those road-based pension obligations that will be covered by the Minister's undertaking to devote part of the proceeds of sale to fulfilling them. The clause is really a mirror image of clause 44(2), which defines the rail-based pension obligations to which the provisions of part III will apply. The two clauses together contain the pension obligations with which the Bill is concerned. Clause 41 concerns pension funds that are road-based and clause 44(2) those which are rail-based.<br><br>
It may well be that a certain amount of belt and braces care has gone into the drafting of the clause. But, for the avoidance of doubt, let me explain that clause 41(2) also sets out exactly which pension obligations are not included in the road-based pension liabilities to which clause 40 applies.<br><br>
Of course, there are many pension obligations on the corporation-company that are not the concern of the Bill, the Government or the Committee—that is, current service pensions, and so on. Therefore, subsection (2) sets out various pension obligations which will not be the subject matter of undertakings in clause 40. That is the basic structure of the clause.<br><br>
If the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) wishes me to make the matter absolutely clear, I shall put into the record, so to speak, a paraphrase of the clause explaining exactly which pension obligations are comprised in clause 40 and which are not. I note that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), is inviting me to do that.<br><br>
Before embarking on that, I shall deal with the position of National Carriers.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1007">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1855</span>
Pension obligations of that company are excluded from subsection (1). Because of National Carriers' past, the obligations that exist are rail-based. Historic rail-based pensions are defined in clause 44(2), which is in part III of the Bill. To the best of my knowledge, there are no present employees of National Carriers whose pension entitlement is historically road-based and of the sort that we are discussing.<br><br>
We believe that those employees whose pension rights are properly the subject matter of the Bill will fall under the rail-based section, which is why National Carriers is excluded. I must proceed carefully, so I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I make copious use of notes. I shall run through clause 41 to put on record exactly what is being denned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May we refer to them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall hand the notes over afterwards if the hon. Gentleman wishes. In fact, I hope that Opposition Members already have them, as we have tried to provide notes on clauses and give guidance to help steer the debate into relevance.<br><br>
The road-based obligations that will be affected by an undertaking in clause 40 are defined in subsection (1). Broadly, they are, first, those that are historic—that is a phrase which we keep using through the Bill. For this purpose, a curious definition of the word "historic" is adopted. Basically, that means obligations which were owed by the corporation as at 1 April 1975, or obligations arising after that date to pay increases in pensions on those pre-April 1975 obligations.<br><br>
Secondly, they must be owed by the successor company itself, or by its road-based subsidiaries—that is, nearly everything apart from National Carriers and its subsidiaries.<br><br>
Thirdly, to be road-based pension obligations for the purpose of the Minister's undertaking under clause 40, they must be owed in connection with the three main NFC pension schemes which are specified in clause 40(6), wherein are clearly set out the relevant pension schemes.<br><br>
Those are the three main categories which define which pension obligations we are talking about are covered by an obligation.<br><br>
Clause 41(2) gives exactly which obligations are ruled out. It begins in a com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1856</span>
mon sense way by excluding all the rail-based obligations which we shall come to in part III of the Bill. The Government are excluding for the purposes of their undertaking any obligation to pay increases in pensions exceeding those granted to Civil Service pensioners, which is an appropriate enough ceiling to put on the index-linking liabilities which the Government are disposed to think of as properly relevant to their undertaking.<br><br>
Fourth, obligations to pay employers' contributions in respect of employees' current service are excluded. We have assumed throughout that the current service pensions are continuing to be funded on a perfectly ordinary basis.<br><br>
Fifth, certain obligations to pay management expenses of schemes are excluded because the management expenses of the three relevant schemes are properly borne by the continuing schemes and are a proper charge upon their present income and contributions.<br><br>
Sixth, obligations owed in the capacity of trustees or persons administering the schemes concerned are excluded.<br><br>
Finally, obligations are excluded in respect of which the successor company or the subsidiaries concerned have the right to be indemnified by third parties. I would require further notice and time if examples were wanted of that. I do not know what particular obligations exist for which they do have indemnities on pension obligations for which perhaps a previous employer has undertaken to indemnify them, clearly there is no reason why an obligation which is covered by an indemnity should in turn be subject to any kind of undertaking or cover by the Government.<br><br>
That is the shape of the clause and it is a clear way of setting out exactly the rail-based pension obligations which the Government are to concern themselves with when they act in the way described in clause 40. Clause 41 is purely a definition clause. It is possible that clause 41 could have been drafted by combining it with subsection (1) and setting out, in terse language, exactly those obligations to which the Government are thinking of making a contribution. It would normally follow that what was not included in the definition was automatically left out and was of no concern to the Government.<br><br>
But this is such a complex area that it is just as well we have subsection (2), which, for the complete avoidance of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1857</span>
doubt, sets out exactly what the Government are not proposing to interest themselves in and the exemptions. Apart from the detailed and technical ones, the two biggest headings are railway pensions, which are dealt with in another part of the Bill, and current service pensions, which are no concern of this legislation.<br><br>
I believe, therefore, that in a necessarily complex way, but with precision, the clause defines exactly what "relevant pension obligations" means when interpreting clause 40.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for clearing up the point about National Carriers and for confirming my worst fears about the remainder of the clause. With the greatest of respect to him, that definition in subsection (3) does not mean what he just said the clause means. He said that the clause means that subsection (1) is referring to relevant pension obligations in respect of clause 40—in other words, the road-based historic funds—and he also said that subsection (2), for the avoidance of doubt, spells out the real historic relevant pension schemes and that they are not included in subsection (1).<br><br>
That would be fair enough if we did not have subsection (3). Subsection (3) states, presumably referring to the whole of clause 41, including subsections (1) and (2):
<br><blockquote><p>"In this section—'pension', in relation to any of the relevant pension schemes, has the same meaning as in Part III".</p></blockquote>
The reference to "relevant pension schemes" in clause 41(l)(<i>c</i>) obviously does not mean the same as in part III. It cannot do so. The meaning relates to clause 40 and surely refers to the road-based historic liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two clauses taken together seek to separate two categories of pension obligations. Subsection (3) is saying that, in order to make these definitions sensible and mutually compatible, the word "pension" is to be given the same meaning when one reads both clauses.<br><br>
The fact that the word "pension" is to have the same meaning in both clauses does not alter the fact that one is talking about differing pension obligations in dealing with the two parts. Although one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1858</span>
gives the same general definition to the word "pensions" when reading both parts, in clause 40 one is dealing with relevant pension obligations as defined under clause 41, and in part III we are dealing with relevant pension obligations as defined in clause 44(2). There is no conflict between the two.<br><br>
The legislation will bear upon "relevant pension obligations" as defined. It is simply that when reaching the definition one puts the same meaning on the word "pension" in both parts which, as part III makes clear, is a broad general definition of "pension". In both cases one has to pick up which relevant pension obligations one is talking about and in both cases give the widest possible definition of "pension," which includes all the other ancillary attributes of the pension schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We both understand what the clause seeks to do, but I think that it is an incredibly clumsy way of doing it. There are two sets of relevant pension obligations, and that is clearly understood. One set relates only to the NFC—the historic road-based schemes—and the other set relates to historic rail-based schemes, some of which are to be found in the NFC and some in British Rail. But the way in which clause 41 sets about defining the former is by saying "This is the former but it shall not include the latter". That is the part in subsection (2). It then adds a definition.<br><br>
If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to say that "pension" within the term "relevant pension scheme" bears the same relationship to the schemes in one set as in the other, that is undeniable. It clearly does that. But I cannot see why the Parliamentary Secretary has chosen this form of construction to define the schemes. It seems only to confuse those who want to draw a clear distinction. Having heard the explanation, I think a better way would be not to refer to both as relevant pension schemes but to give one set a name which clearly defined it as being road-based, and give another name for the rail-based. We would not then have this most complex construction.<br><br>
But having debated the clause and agreed on what the clause should be doing, perhaps we can set it aside for reflection on both sides before Report, when we shall see whether we can better define the two groups and possibly give
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1859</span>
them different names.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will make one last attempt to clarify the position. This is not a matter which could appropriately be taken up on Report. Both sides of the Committee would be in danger of making themselves look ridiculous if we debated the definition of terms in the Bill on the Floor of the House. This is a matter which ought to be resolved in the Committee.<br><br>
The actual definition of the word "pension" is to be found in clause 50(1)—if I may take the serious risk of confusing matters further by referring to another clause. In clause 50(1), amongst the definitions of several terms, the word "pension" is defined. That is the definition clause for part III. It so happens that in that definition clause we need one definition for part II, which is "pensions". Therefore, in subsection (3) we inserted this little proviso making clear that "pension" in part II has the same meaning as it has in part III, which is the meaning set out in clause 50. The reason why it is necessary to have the same definition of "pension" in both parts is to ensure that they are genuinely mutually exclusive.<br><br>
Clause 41 defines the relevant obligations. What makes the definition is subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), in which we make clear what is not in. We exclude all pension obligations that are in part III. If by chance anyone tried to construct this so that "pension" meant something different in part II from what it meant in part III, it is possible that we would fail to have a clear separation because we might have excluded rail-based pensions defined in a different way, so there might be certain pension obligations that were left in a cloudy area, possibly covered by clause 41 and possibly by clause 43. So we make it clear in subsection (2) by taking out all the part III schemes, and, in deciding what are part III schemes and what are part II schemes, "pension" is given the same meaning throughout and the word "pension" is defined in part III. It is defined more precisely in clause 50(1).<br><br>
I realise that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness and I are going down ever more tortuous paths, but I hope that upon reconsideration, and perhaps upon reading what we have said, it will become clear and be seen to make sense.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only one question to raise on clause 42, which is whether the definition of "securities" is wide enough to embrace any National Loans Fund stock that is held be the successor company. I am told by those who know much more about definitions of stock, debentures and other securities that it is not necessarily immediately apparent that loans held by the successor company are covered by the definition. I would be grateful, therefore, if the Minister would tell us whether he intends that securities as defined in clause 42 should cover such holdings by the successor company or whether—this appears to be an alternative—it is his intention that the successor company should not in any circumstances have National Loans Fund stock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Basically, the answer is that subsection (1) explains certain expressions that are used in the Bill and, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, the only one which is not self-explanatory is "securities". The legislation will enable the successor company to issue not merely shares but also the other types of security which are defined in the clause. Thus, the Government will retain maximum flexibility to determine the capital structure of the successor company in the light of the circumstances at the time of transfer of the NFC's undertaking. In other words, the Government might wish to issue a proportion of fixed interest loan stock rather than 100 per share capital and that would be provided for. But the National Loans Fund stock which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned would not be covered.</span></p>

COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<br><blockquote><p><ol>
<li>The Minister shall by regulations provide for the payment by the Minister or by such person as may be prescribed by or determined under the regulations of compensation to or in respect of any

person who is, or prior to the making of the regulations, has been in any employment as may be so prescribed and who suffers loss of employment or loss or diminution of emoluments or pension rights or worsening of his position which is attributable to any provision of this Act or any instrument made under this Act.</li>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The object of the new clause is to provide a compensation scheme for staff who are or may be adversely affected by the transfer of the NFC from being a nationalised industry, as at present, to being a private sector company.<br><br>
This is a curious Bill. Paragraph 4 of schedule 6 provides for the compensation obligation, set out in the Transport Act 1968 and the Transport Holding Company Act 1972, to fall on the successor company that will be brought about by part II of the Bill. That is to be welcomed. The question that arises, however, is, why does not the Bill make provision for a new compensation scheme in respect of the present transfer of assets and staff which is proposed in part II?<br><br>
The Minister could argue that it would be inappropriate for this kind of compensation scheme to be instituted for a sale into the private sector because such a scheme was appropriate only for transfer within the public sector. But that is not so. There are considerable precedents in the history of railway Bills, and, considering the important part they have played in the development of modern legislation, I think you will agree, Mr. English, that they set some powerful precedents for the House and Committee.<br><br>
Some of the railway Bills which had nothing to do with the public sector provided compensation schemes. The Trans-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1862</span>
port Act 1921, which amalgamated many smaller companies, provided that a man who moved from the service of one company to another was not to be put in any worse position in respect of his conditions of service as a whole than he had been in during his previous employment. The 1921 Act had nothing to do with transfers in or out of the public sector. It was for transfers of railway company staff from a number of small companies to a larger company as a result of the 1921 amalgamations. There seems to be a good case for continuing that kind of provision to cover people when they transfer to the National Freight Company.<br><br>
It is interesting that the clause referred to in paragraph 4 of schedule 6 gives the game away, because one of the compensation schemes carried forward by the Bill was established by section 2(4) of the Transport Holding Company Act 1972. That Act provided for the transfer from the public into the private sector of the Thomas Cook organisation. It was felt at that time that a compensation provision as set out in our new clause 18 was appropriate.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
When introducing the discussion on clause 2 in the Committee stage of the Transport Holding Company Bill on 14 December 1971, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths), who was then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, referred to an amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Bradley), who then represented the constituency of Leicester, North-East. The Under-Secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Since there is precedent for the inclusion of this type of wording in this type of Measure, there can be no objection in principle to the hon. Gentleman's Amendment."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 14 December 1971; c.88.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend's amendment sought to add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"or worsening of his position"</p></blockquote>
—a provision which the Under-Secretary himself had introduced.<br><br>
What a change there has been, apparently, since 1971. I had never regarded the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds as one of the "wets" or "softies" on the Conservative Benches in the House of Commons, either at that time or now.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1863</span>
However, it appears that the sensible line which he pursued in introducing that measure is now regarded as wholly soft and reprehensible. Hard-faced policies are being introduced in the measure before us. In an effort to offset the ill-effects of these hard-faced policies on people who have worked for the National Freight Corporation we seek to include new clause 16. It is noticeable that hard-faced policies are being pursued by the right Hon. and hon. Members on the Conservative Benches. They propose that existing procedures for dealing with disputes in the National Freight Corporation should come to an end, the traditional precedent for the inclusion of compensation clauses in railway legislation is being ignored, and they are treading on the rights of the existing staff of the NFC and on the rights that the staff could expect to exercise in the future, having taken jobs with that corporation, or having been transferred from British Rail in 1968.<br><br>
That seems to be another example of the kind of virility testing which is apparently carried out at No. 10 Downing Street these days—to test whether leading members of the Government have the necessary hardness of approach to such matters and whether they are sufficiently hard-faced and virile in pursuing the Conservative policy of treading on the rights of anybody who happens to be employed in a public sector industry and actually to work for a living.<br><br>
One of the reasons put forward—and it has been put forward previously in respect of other amendments we have proposed to the Bill—is that all the staff of the National Freight Corporation will then have exactly the same protection under the Employment Protection Act as employees of any other company, and therefore compensation provision on the lines of new clause 18 is rendered unnecessary.<br><br>
First, as my right hon. Friend pointed out it is ironic that right Hon. and hon. Member opposite should plead the merits of the Employment Protection Act and suggest that it is so wholly laudable that it should replace all other measures intended to protect employees, because they fought it tooth and nail. I am willing to bet that the Minister of Transport voted against all the provisions from which he would now suggest that employees of the National Freight Corporation should benefit under the Employment Protection
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1864</span>
Act.<br><br>
Such considerations are irrelevant in any event, because, following the reor-ganistion of the freight transport industry in 1968, employees of both National Freight Corporation and British Rail were in a better position with regard to compensation and other matters relating to the rights of employees before the Employment Protection Act came into operation.<br><br>
There is, therefore, absolutely no reason why they should not remain in a better position after the enactment of the legislation. If it was right and appropriate and not a breach of some fundamental constitutional principle that those employees were in a better position in terms of the law between 1968 and 1974 than the general body of workers, there is absolutely no reason why they should not continue to be in a favourable position. It seems to me that they are entitled to what might be described as "most favoured nation" treatment, in that they have had this kind of protection since the railway amalgamation of the 1920s. It therefore seems to me to be sharp practice on the part of the Government not to provide a compensation provision of this kind.<br><br>
As I have said before in relation to the carrying forward of rights of the staff of the National Freight Corporation, whatever the Minister may think, those people are concerned about the safety of their jobs and their job prospects and about how they may be treated by their new owners once the company is sold off into the private sector.<br><br>
If the Government are prepared to place upon the new company the compensation obligations laid upon the old National Freight Corporation by the Transport Act 1968 and the Transport Holding Company Act 1972, there is no reason in principle why they should not lay upon the new company certain compensation obligations. Those obligations have been no great burden to the National Freight Corporation. They have been very limited in their impact, but they have been of substantial benefit to the limited number of people who were adversely affected by the statutory change of employer. That is what is happening now. Therefore, at a time when the Conservative Party and all its members are going around chanting about trying to get people to work harder and all the rest of it, they should be ensuring that people who feel some sense of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1865</span>
security in the organisation for which they work are able to carry that forward. That will be conducive to their continuing to work hard in the new National Freight Company, and it will give them a sense of security.<br><br>
There is absolutely no reason, either financial or in principle, why the Government should not agree to a compensation clause, either in the exact terms of new clause 18 or some variation of it, at a latter stage. If they reject the idea of a new clause that is intended to provide an element of compensation for the no doubt limited number of people who will be adversely affected by the transfer of National Freight Corporation employees to the new private company, they are being hard-faced for the sake of it. There is no issue of principle at stake. There is no question of massive finances. There is no question of such a provision making it difficult for the Minister to sell off the shares in the company.<br><br>
In those circumstances, I hope that the Minister will say now that he is prepared to accept a compensation clause. I believe, indeed, that it is a duty owed by Parliament to people who have worked hard and loyally for the National Freight Corporation, providing a decent service many of them for a very long time, and many of them not being exactly overpaid for the privilege. I hope that the Minister will therefore accept the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the new clause, as the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), has said, is to require the Minister to make regulations providing for the payment by such person as may be prescribed by such regulations of compensation to any employee who suffers loss of employment, loss or diminution of pay or pension rights or worsening of his position that is attributable to the Bill.<br><br>
Basically, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South, has raised three questions. First and foremost, he asks whether employees will suffer as a result of the Bill. That must be the basic guide to the aim of his proposed new clause. His fear is that present employees of the NFC will suffer or could suffer as a result of the transfer of their employment. That general concern appears to be misplaced. I should say that it was an exaggeration. In fact, I should go further
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1866</span>
than that. It is totally untrue to suggest that we are treading on the rights of the present employees of the NFC. I do not believe for one moment that they have any cause to fear the transfer of ownership to the private sector. Indeed, I believe entirely the opposite to be true. By taking advantage of the greater commercial freedom available to the private sector, the company will be assured of a more secure and prosperous future. That in itself will ensure greater job security for the staff.<br><br>
We in Parliament can pass all the legislation that we like, but the fact of the matter is that whether a person is successfully employed in a company will depend on the success of that company. That is not hard-line economics or any of the other evils referred to by the hon. Gentleman. It is purely a question of common sense. I do not believe that anyone, whatever his economic views, could object to that statement. The changes will make the success of the company a much more likely prospect than it would be if the corporation were left in its present form. Similarly, the chances of success for those who work for the NFC are also increased.<br><br>
The second question raised by the hon. Gentleman was that employee compensation is a long-established feature of transport legislation. We have given some thought to that matter. Let me try to explain why we believe that the provisions of the Bill make unnecessary the kind of protection that the hon. Gentleman had in mind when drafting the new clause. First of all, it clearly contradicts one of the fundamental aims of the Bill—to free the NFC from restrictions and impositions of that kind. It is essential that the rights and obligations of the successor company should from the outset correspond with those of any Companies Act company, without any of the special obligations that now apply to the NFC as a statutory corporation. Only in such circumstances will the company be able to compete on fair and equal terms in the free market. Clearly, obligations such as those proposed could involve the company in an open-ended and ill-defined commitment extending into the future. The hon. Gentleman does not need any words of mine to remind him what the impact of that could be.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The second point is that the need to make provision for such compensation has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1867</span>
passed. It is perfectly fair for the hon. Gentleman to go back and look at previous Acts, and to say that compensation was provided under some of the Railway Acts of years gone by. But staff now have the benefit of the substantial protection afforded to all employees in both the public and the private sectors by the Employment Protection Act. That Act was passed by the Labour Government, although I do not believe that they would have claimed to be the only authors of some of its elements, such as the provisions on wrongful dismissal. In other words, the situation has changed. That is one of the distinctions that we would draw between the position today and that in previous years. There is no reason why employees of the new company should have special protection beyond that available to all employees.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's third question, I believe, was whether the Bill would remove protection already given to employees in earlier legislation. He seems to be indicating that that was not what he was concerned about. Nevertheless, I shall make clear that the Bill will not affect rights given to employees under earlier legislation. It provides for the new company to take on the compensating functions now carried out by the NFC under the 1968 Act and the Transport Holding Company Act 1972. Those obligations are inherited by the new company. I feel that I should make that position clear.<br><br>
Therefore, all that divides us is the question whether the protection previously given is now necessary, The Government take the view that the new structure of the company will give its employees greater opportunities and greater security for the future than they now have. Secondly, legislation which followed the two Acts previously mentioned renders unnecessary the type of clause suggested by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept any of the arguments that have been put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. I thought that I had made clear that prior to 1974 the staff concerned—particularly those who were with British Rail before moving to National Carriers and so on—were in a position more favourable than that provided by the general body of the law. There is no logical reason why they should not retain their favourable position after 1974, and after the reorganisation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1868</span>
I should like to make one or two further points. The Minister has suggested that I posed the question "Will people who are transferred suffer?" All I can say is that the representatives of those who will be transferred fear that at least some of them may suffer. I also want to make clear that I do not envisage that legions of people will suffer in ways that will be assisted by our new clause 18. On the lines of the provision in paragraph (4) of schedule 6, limited categories of people are likely to suffer and probably individuals rather than categories. It seems wholly appropriate that, having protected those limited numbers of people who might suffer before, there is every reason for us to continue that protection.<br><br>
I do not think that it is exaggeration or misplaced concern on the part of the Opposition to ask the Minister how is he so omniscient that he knows that people will not suffer? Even the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) was sufficiently aware of the non-omniscience of Ministers and their ministerial advisers in 1971 that he felt that a compensation clause was appropriate.<br><br>
I make the point that if the future is so rosy, there is no loss at all to the new National Freight Company in conceding a compensation clause on these lines, If it is to prosper, it will not make a ha'porth of difference to its total finances but will give an element of security to people who may be damaged by the transfer.<br><br>
I make the further point that if it is not now necessary, why was it thought to be necessary when people were being transferred as a result of the Transport Holding Company Act 1972? The Minister has confirmed the existing obligations on compensation schemes which the NFC had. If they are so irrelevant, why is he rightly including their continuation in the Bill and making sure that the new National Freight Company will take on board the obligations of the old NFC to employees who benefited from earlier compensation schemes? If there is no need for compensation, I do not see why he is doing that. I am not arguing against the inclusion, of course, but, it just seems illogical on his part not to include a compensation scheme on this occasion.<br><br>
But perhaps we get down to it in the end, because the Minister said that if the new company had this sort of burden placed upon it, it could not compete on fair and equal terms in the free market
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1869</span>
with the other cowboy operators in the private road transport sector. That may be the truth of the matter and, it may well be that with the terms and conditions of employment which the NFC has offered over the years, it will be found extremely difficult to compete with some of the cowboy operators in his area, particularly if some of them have bought their way into the NFC to start with. Therefore, I return to the point that the people working for the NFC and their representatives in all three of the unions involved have been seeking this sort of compensation clause.<br><br>
The Minister, of course, knows better and has decided that everybody has a rosier prospect in the future than they have at present. I say that he ought ot put himself in the shoes of those who work for the NFC and think along the lines of how he would feel about what are undoubtedly unknown and uncharted waters for the staff of the NFC. It seems that there is no loss to him—not even in his virility testing at 10 Downing Street—in looking after the relatively small number of staff who will be likely to benefit from such a compensation scheme, and no financial loss or burden that would be borne by the new privately owned company if this sort of compensation clause was conceded.<br><br>
I repeat that I find his arguments wholly unconvincing, as will the staff, I am sure. As we said about the introduction or carry forward of the present arrangements for negotiation and consultation within the NFC, if industrial relations in the new National Freight Company are not as good or productive as they were with the old NFC, the responsibility will lie squarely on the shoulders of the Minister or Transport or whoever has succeeded him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe there is a distinction to be drawn between the employees of the NFC affected by the provisions of the Bill and the population at large affected by the Employment Protection Act, apart from that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). When I introduced the Employment Protection Bill to the House, on second Reading and at all subsequent stages I took the view that if in some cases it provided rights which were available only to a few in favourable positions, it did not follow automatically that those in favourable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1870</span>
positions should necessarily in every case seek to advance their position relative to the rest.<br><br>
The reason I believe my hon. Friend to be fundametally right in pursuing the new clause is that where Parliament passes legislation which puts in jeopardy the jobs, the pension rights and all those things that go with the jobs of a group of people, Parliament has the responsibility to decide whether to build in special protection for those rights that are endangered, solely as a right of a parliamentary decision. I believe that that has been a principle accepted in the House in one piece of transport legislation after another.<br><br>
At an earlier stage of the Bill, reference was made to section 135 of the Transport Act 1968, which seems to be a perfect example of this principle being embodied in legislation. In section 135 of the Transport Act 1968, a provision was made requiring the Minister to make regulations to guard people against loss of employment, diminution of their emoluments, pension rights or any worsening of their position which flowed directly from certain provisions of that Act. So it seems that one of the criteria that should be applied in this case is the simple criterion that where Parliament takes steps which puts jobs and the things that go with those jobs in any form of jeopardy, Parliament should be responsible for the protection that flows from that.<br><br>
We can understand that a Conservative Minister's philosophy is that if one is getting rid of something from the public sector into the private sector, for goodness sake give to those who will run that which is in the private sector all the "advantages", as the Minister would call them, of having no statutory obligations placed upon them that are not placed upon their competitors.<br><br>
But from this side of the Committee we take a very different view. We believe that where a public asset is being sold, the public have a right to be concerned about the effect of that sale upon the jobs of people who up until now have manned those assets and ensured that they have developed effectively in competition in the market place.<br><br>
There is no evidence to show that the NFC cannot compete in this area, given the number of statutory obligations that it now has. On the contrary, it is generally acknowledged that the NFC has suc-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1871</span>
ceeded remarkably well with very difficult statutory limitations placed upon it and very difficult financial limits placed upon its means of operation.<br><br>
There has been co-operation between the work force and the management of the NFC which has enabled some very effective services to be developed. If that is now to be put in jeopardy, as I believe it would be if the Minister is to say to those people working the NFC "You shall no longer have the statutory protection that Parliament traditionally affords to those whose jobs in the transport industry are being affected by parliamentary provision", I think that he is not only endangering the valuable relationship that exists, but that he will put that successor company in a position of being regarded with suspicion by those who up to now have co-operated with the management. That would be a bad way in which to start off this new phase in the life of National Freight, so I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position that he has taken on the new clause.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened very carefully to the Minister. That is what I invariably do. It seems to be that basically his argument is that there is no need for the new clause. If he is convinced that there is no need for it, surely there is no harm in its being put in. His argument would have more credibility if he had borne in mind that earlier in the debate the Opposition repeatedly tried to table amendments with the aim of safeguarding pension rights in the successor company. That is to take only one item from the new clause. But he has repeatedly opposed that point of view.<br><br>
How can the Minister say that there is no need for the new clause, which specifically refers to "pension rights or worsening" of the position? I could have agreed with the Minister's argument had he accepted the earlier Opposition amendments that imposed a condition on the successor company to look after pension rights. But he refused to do that.<br><br>
It is amazing to hear the Minister talk about the Employment Protection Act 1975 and place so much reliance on that. As I recall the matter, when that Bill was being debated the Conservative Party said that it would make people bankrupt. But a change of heart has now occurred. All of a sudden that Act, which was going to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1872</span>
bankrupt people, is being brought to the Minister's rescue in his argument that the new clause is not necessary.<br><br>
Is that a deathbed conversion? Has some divine light shone upon the Minister for him now to cite as a saviour an Act that he opposed? I hope that such wonderful conversions continue throughout the Bill and that the Minister will allow the new clause in as a belt and braces job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Being a reasonable man, I always like to pay tribute to the measures that have been passed by my predecessors, especially when they are helpful to the present Government. Certainly, those parts of the Employment Protection Act that incorporated Conservative industrial relations legislation were a considerable step forward, so I am perfectly prepared to take the credit for that. In the hope of achieving unity between the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and myself, I suggest that if I accept some parts of the Employment Protection Act, he in turn should accept some parts of this Transport Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman had one basic point. He said that if there is no need for the clause it would do no harm to put it into the Bill. But that adds an element of uncertainty to the legislation and to the position of the successor company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for the staff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the staff in a moment. Frankly, I do not believe that it is a reasonable thing to ask. Earlier statutory compensation provisions have given rise to much litigation, most notably in a recent House of Lords case concerning the interpretation of "worsenment". I believe, therefore, that there are strong arguments about making such provision in this legislation.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, such a decision is not confined simply to this Bill. There is no comparable provision included in either the Civil Aviation Bill or the British Aerospace Bill, which are before Parliament at present. The Government have taken a view on the matter.<br><br>
Although we do not have the exact figures, under the Road Traffic Act 1972 only a small number of people have claimed a few hundred pounds. The presumption must be against adding to legislation rather than in favour of that. I do not believe that it would be proper for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1873</span>
argument to prevail that because at present we cannot see that there will be difficulties, we should add to that possibility.<br><br>
Employees will not suffer as a result of the legislation. The position is clear on that. I think that the need to make provisions of this type has long since passed. Indeed, it is arguable whether we should have included it in the 1972 Act, as was done. Certainly, I do not believe that it should be included in an Act of 1980.<br><br>
Staff have the benefit of the substantial protection that is afforded to all employees in both the public and the private sectors by the Employment Protection</span></p>

DUTY OF MINISTER TO LAY BEFORE PARLIAMENT STATEMENT AS TO ASSETS, RIGHTS, LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SUCCESSOR COMPANY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><br><blockquote><p>"At the commencement of the final period the Minister shall lay before both Houses of Parliament a statement of all assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the successor company and similarly on the appointed day a valuation by independent valuers of all property owned by the successor company shall be attached to the statement on the appointed day.".—[<i>Mr. Cowans.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the first time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I was a little early in the last occasion, but I always believe that it is better to be early than late.<br><br>
On a serious note, the Opposition are deeply concerned about something. With your permission, Mr. English, it will be necessary, casually—I am justified in using that word—to refer to a clause that has already been passed—clause 39. The basis of our new clause is that what clause 39 lays down in respect of the Minister is not specific enough.<br><br>
For instance, clause 39 lays an obligation that:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1874</span>
Act. In my view, there is no reason why the company's employees should have special protection beyond what is available to all. I do not agree with right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) when he says that Parliament is placing those people in jeopardy. The whole purpose of what we are seeking is to provide new opportunity for the company and its employees.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>"The statement shall be in such form and contain such particulars, compiled in such manner, as the Minister may direct with the approval of the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
We want the Bill to be more specific about that.<br><br></p>
<p>In previous debates we have discussed the giving away—that is what it is, and the phrase loses nothing by repetition—of £100 million of taxpayers' money, £45 million of tax rebates and £15 million of grants. It takes no mathematical genius to work out that that is a total of £160 million being given away. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary with his usual diligence is hanging upon my every word and no doubt will come up with some good reason that will fail to satisfy us as to why he should do nothing about it. The Bill at present is without responsibility. We seek to put some responsibility into it. That is the purpose of the new clause.<br><br></p>
<p>The key provisions of the new clause are the following. First,
<br><blockquote><p>"At the commencement of the final period the Minister shall lay before both Houses of Parliament"—</p></blockquote>
if that is not democracy, I do not know what is, knowing my hon. Friends' views on the subject—
<br><blockquote><p>"a statement of all assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the successor company".</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1875</span>
<p>As a legislative body surely this House should have all the facts and figures before it. I shall therefore listen most carefully to any argument from the Parliamentary Secretary as to why that should not be the case. I do not believe that there is any argument. It is vital that not only the Committee but the whole House should have that information in order to know the true situation.<br><br></p>
<p>The new clause continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"and similarly on the appointed day a valuation"—</p></blockquote>
and this is the nub of the proposal—
<br><blockquote><p>"by independent valuers".</p></blockquote>
Far be it from me to cast any aspersions upon the Minister or anyone he may appoint—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not go down that trail. I could spend a considerable time on that, but I will not be led into that trap.<br><br>
If the Minister wishes to ensure credibility in the eyes of all Members on both sides of the House, why should he not accept independent valuers? That would surely increase his credibility. But if he appoints them himself, there could be even a small doubt. Why does he not remove that doubt by accepting the new clause to provide that independent valuers—independent of either side—shall draw up the statement of information for this House? It is vital that that information should come before the House.<br><br>
It may be argued that the latter part of the new clause is covered by clause 39(5), which provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister shall lay a copy of the statement and report before each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
But it does not provide for independent valuers and it does not provide that this shall be at the commencement of the final period.<br><br>
Two issues therefore arise here. We are seeking to help the Minister. We are providing for independent valuers in order to increase his credibility, and we are asking that the House should have the information. I shall be very interested to hear anything that the Parliamentary Secretary can find to say against the new clause. Indeed, I may well have more to say if he does not accept it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1876</span>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always reluctant to reject offers of help from the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), to clarify the Bill. However, I am not inclined at the moment to accept his offer on this occasion. Indeed, I hope to persuade the hon. Gentleman, as I have on some of his previous amendments, that the purpose that he seeks to achieve will be quite happily served without adding the new clause to the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has not really spelt out exactly why he is so concerned to have these provisions made. I assume that it has to do with his concern about asset stripping, which we shall not debate again but which he and his hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), seem convinced is a risk in this disposal. I have so far failed to dissuade them on that, although it remains my conviction that the basis for their beliefs is mythical.<br><br>
They are now anxious to have two sets of valuations of the assets, liabilities and so on of the corporation at two specific stages. The first is at the beginning of the final stage. Under the Bill, that means the period between that covered by the last annual report and accounts and the appointed day when the corporation becomes a company. They also want a further statement of the position on that appointed day. I assume that they do not envisage any asset stripping going on in the intervening period. As it is only on the second of the two dates that the corporation will become that most ungodly of objects in the eyes of the Opposition—a Companies Act company. During the intervening period it will remain a nationalised corporation. It is certainly a new gloss on the argument if the Opposition are now suggesting that asset stripping will start even while it remains a nationalised corporation. At any rate, those are the two dates for which the new clause requires full information to be put before the House.<br><br>
The first date is that of the last statement and annual report before the appointed day. All the information that Parliament has always deemed relevant, and all the information that appears to be sought by the new clause, will be contained in that annual report and accounts. So long as it remains a nationalised cor-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1877</span>
poration in its present form, the corporation will continue to produce an annual report and accounts, published in March or April each year, in respect of the period up to the preceding 31 December. In accordance with the present legislation, under the Transport Acts 1962 and 1968, an annual report and accounts setting out the full assets, rights, liabilities and so on will be produced and laid before both Houses of Parliament. It is, indeed, upon past annual reports that the Opposition have drawn for the latest indication that we have of the present asset values, property values and so on of the corporation.<br><br>
Therefore, in relation to the first of the two dates to which the new clause refers, the purpose will be served by the annual report and accounts which will be published in the usual way and laid before Parliament.<br><br>
One then comes to the situation when the corporation becomes a company. I assume that there is no real fear of any asset stripping taking place between the beginning of the final period and the appointed day. We have already dealt with the question of producing accounts for that last period of time during which the corporation remains a corporation. Assuming that the appointed day may fall in the middle of a financial year, we have discussed the provision for that. Clearly, the corporation must account up to the very last day of its existence for the public assets that it owns and manages. We therefore made provision for the Minister to have powers to prescribe the form of the accounts for the final period. But, as we discussed earlier, they will follow almost exactly the present pattern. The main variation will be in the period of time covered. A report and accounts will be laid before Parliament in the usual way. Again, therefore, exactly the same information will be provided—the valuation of assets, liabilities, obligations, and so on—and laid before Parliament in those accounts.<br><br>
I think that the Opposition are really concerned about the valuation when flotation takes place. But that is not covered by the new clause at all. I intend to be helpful in anticipating what is worrying hon. Members, in particular the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). If one wants to know the assets, the liabilities and everything else on the date of flotation, one must
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1878</span>
turn to the prospectus which will be issued in support of the sale of shares. Clear obligations are laid down by the Companies Act in respect of the contents of prospectuses. The prospectus will contain all the information that it should to indicate the value of the assets owned by the company in which a share of the equity is being offered to private subscribers. The prospectus is not a secret document. The information on the valuation will be freely available. One cannot refer to it thereafter, because then the information goes on to the ordinary Companies Act accounts which will be produced.<br><br>
I am not sure at what stage the hon. Member labours the need for independent valuation, which he apparently wants on the appointed day. No one has ever queried the bases of the valuation which the NFC has used so far. The valuation will be made in the same way as it is now for the annual report and annual accounts. I see no advantage to an asset-stripper, let alone the Government or the corporation, in disguising the value of the assets in the annual statement of accounts of the NFC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are buying the shares.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not buying the shares. The Government are the seller of shares. If it is now the hon. Gentleman's fear that the seller of the shares will, for some reason, undervalue the assets which he is presenting for sale, I think that that is an unreal fear. We should be committing a criminal offence if we artificially inflated the value of the assets and put in the prospectus a valuation which the land would not bear. Anyone who floats shares and tries to get the best possible price in order to make a contribution to public funds, will go for as full a valuation of the assets and as attractive a presentation of them as possible.<br><br>
I do not see the danger at which the amendment is aimed. I do not want to concede for a moment the existence of the favourite bogy men of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South—those asset-strippers lying in wait. If they are to strip any assets, they will do it after any of the periods about which we are talking. Once they have laid their filthy hands on the shares, I suppose they may start disposing of the property after the flotation. That is the sinister plot in which Opposition Members firmly believe.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1879</span>
The new clause does not relate to that. I do not see the relevance to asset-striping of valuations of the assets at the beginning of the final period, when we have the ordinary report and accounts, on the appointed day, when we shall have an almost identical form of report and accounts, or on the date of flotation, when we shall have the prospectus. I do not see the scope for the described asset-stripping in the National Freight Corporation. We do not contemplate that it would occur. The only examples cited are the property values in the present National Carriers depots. Anybody who starts disposing of or running down that business will find that, if depots close, there is a property value in the sites. Most of the depots themselves are not the finest type of industrial building, so we are concerned with the development value of the sites. Anyone running down the sites of National Carriers will have the development value of the sites, but against that he will have to make considerable redundancy payments. The present shape of National Carriers does not make it an attractive proposition to asset-strippers. I believe that investors that will come into the NFC will be seeing it as a trading company. Valuations of the kind described by the new clause have no relevance at all. I hope that I have persuaded Opposition Members out of their fears, be they real or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary said that he had a conviction that asset-strippers would not descend on the new National Freight Company. I hope that it will not be one of the convictions covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, which are wiped out after some years. However, I suspect that his conviction will be, because events will prove that the asset-strippers will descend upon the National Freight Corporation or its successor.<br><br>
I have not consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), but it may be that we stand corrected and we could do with a better new clause than the one before us. This is something to which we must give our attention before Report.<br><br>
Our object—which I shall try to illustrate plainly, as my hon. Friend has done—is to have set out in all its detail, and very plainly, a statement of all the assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the successor company on the basis of an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1880</span>
up-to-date valuation by independent valuers. The reason why we think that to be necessary is that it is essential if anything other than a false prospectus is to be put forward for the sale of shares in the new company. Frankly, I do not mind if the prospectus is false. It is tough luck on anyone who buys into it.<br><br>
However, we want the House to be able to check that a proper price is being obtained for these public assets that are being sold. We would also like to see what kind of assets are being transferred and what kind of liabilities are or are not being transferred to the new private company, so that we have a standard by which to judge whether this far-famed, entirely freed company is to prosper because it is brilliantly run in the private sector, or whether it can soar higher than the NFC simply because it has fewer weights around its neck when it is in the private sector.<br><br>
When talking of what the assets are, we should remember that the current calculation of the assets—or at least the latest calculation available to Opposition Members—is that contained in the notes on accounts of the National Freight Corporation in its report and accounts for 1978. The capital assets approach, roughly speaking, £100 million, of which £58.7 million is in land and buildings. We have said several times, and the Parliamentary Secretary has echoed our remarks today—that there is not much value in many of the buildings of National Carriers. In fact, some of them are more of a liability than an asset. Most of the value of the land and buildings assets of National Carriers is in the land.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary has suggested that the statement that might be made available on the lines of the one that is in the National Freight Corporation report and accounts for 1978 would be satisfactory to my hon. Friend and me. But he must think again, because the notes say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Land and buildings which are included in fixed assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 December 1978 at the net book value of £58.7 million are considered in aggregate to have market values in excess of that net book value."</p></blockquote>
Too true, but it does not go on to say that that net book value was calculated a decade before the report was produced. The valuations were made at the time of the establishment of the NFC, as long ago as 1968. My hon. Friends and I object
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1881</span>
strongly to the suggestion that a valuation that is now 12 years out of date is a proper statement of all the assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the successor company. It simply is not true. It would be grossly misleading and absolutely preposterous. So I hope that a reasonable, up-to-date valuation of the assets will be made.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I am no expert on asset stripping, even if I appear to be obsessed by it. But I know that the asset stripper loves to buy into a company which undervalues its assets in land and then to revalue and sell them off and make an enormous killing by both the sale and the revaluation. The under-valuation of assets in land has been the dream of the asset stripper. That is what would happen if up-to-date valuations were not produced for the NFC's assets in land before the corporation is disposed of.<br><br>
I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that we ought to have a statement as soon as the Bill goes through Parliament. We ought to have another when he turns the corporation into a Companies Act company that is wholly owned by the Minister of Transport, and another before he sells the company, so as to see whether he, at the behest of the Treasury, has been doing some asset stripping himself. The House certainly needs to keep an eye on that. We all know that the Treasury will, like the Assyrian descending on the wolf in the fold, grab anything out of the public sector to tide it over for a few months or so, particularly now when it is trying to beat down the public sector borrowing requirement.<br><br>
There should also be included in the statement of assets a valuation of the famous tax losses that are to be carried forward. They are valued at £45 million, but that needs a little more legislation, as promised in the statement in the House earlier in the month, to clear the question of whether the whole of those tax losses will be available to the new company. We need to know whether 100 per cent. of the £45 million is to be available, or whether it will be a reduced sum. Parliament is entitled to know.<br><br>
I am not sure whether certain items are counted as liabilities or as assets. That ought to be spelt out in the statement. We do not want only a table of figures. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1882</span>
want a full statement that spells things out. I suggest that a value could be put on the fact that there will not be a compensation clause for the staff. Perhaps someone could place a value, positive or negative, on not having a negotiating and consultative machinery carried over.<br><br>
That was described by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister as a burden. I should have thought that it would qualify as an asset, but there should also be a statement about it. And, in fairness to the NFC, we ought to have an estimate of the likely financial effect of not having to integrate its activities with British Rail, because there are-positive or negative values to that. Those are the things that we wish to see included in a statement.<br><br>
We accept that perhaps our new clause 22 is not as well drafted or as comprehensive as it ought to be, but we will seek to put that right later.<br><br>
Other aspects are regarded as liabilities. We have discussed pensions, and we need to have spelt out clearly whether pensions will be properly funded and what the extent of that funding will be. That provision is in the Bill, as we will see if we are not all mesmerised by the flow of words. But perhaps there will have to be a note from the actuaries saying that they do not agree with the Minister's valuations and actuarial calculations. We should like to know whether there are any substantial liabilities or assets by way of contracts held by any of the existing companies that make up the NFC, or by the NFC itself.<br><br>
It could be that some of their existing contracts are a substantial asset or a substantial liability. Considering the complexity of the companies that are being transferred it may well be that there are some of each. We should expect anything substantial in that line to be reported in the statement of assets and liabilities. We seek a clear and unequivocal statement of the assets, rights, liabilities and obligations of the company at various stages. It would be intended for several purposes. One is that the House and the general public will thereby know the valuation of the company. That will enable us to ensure that the company is not sold off at less than its proper value.<br><br>
The intention—let us make no bones about it—is to establish whether any asset-stripping has taken place during the process leading up to the sale of the company, and to provide a datum point from which we would be able to calculate whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1883</span>
asset-stripping takes place once the company moves into the private sector—when that benighted day actually arrives. We also wish to establish a firm basis of comparison so that people will know under what kinds of liabilities and problems the existing NFC has laboured, what assets it has, and what assets and liabilities in comparison with that will be possessed by the company in its various stages.<br><br>
The idea seems to be that it is a caterpillar now, that it is to go into a cocoon when it is wholly owned by the Minister, and then lo and behold—it will burst forth out of the cocoon and fly as a great butterfly soaring above. That is the Minister's view of it. In my opinion the result of the cocoon stage will probably be a slug, or something similar, and we shall never see the butterfly. However, we wish to ensure that a proper comparison is made of the assets and liabilities at the various stages in the process. We shall then have a firm basis on which to argue about whether the company is being sold off properly and whether it will be fair or unfair to compare the end result with the existing NFC. For those reasons I wholeheartedly support my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, as my hon. Friend has already covered most of the ground. I listened very carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary, as I always do. As he has said, on some occasions he may slightly convert me. However, on this occasion he has not moved me. I have not heard him put forward an argument of any validity. If there is any criticism of the new clause it is that it does not go far enough—I take his point there. His remarks about the day of flotation made a valid point. He can rest assured that we did not miss that, and that we shall take it up at a later stage.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has not convinced me of his reasons for not having an independent valuer. He has certainly not convinced the Opposition that there should not be a statement of accounts at the commencement of the final period. The NFC's year may or may not end on 31 March. For the sake of the discussion let us assume that that date is correct. There is a difference between the accounts at 31 March of a company that is continuing and those of a company that is to be floated. I do not wish to belabour the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1884</span>
point that has been made that one cannot guarantee that the company will carry on in its entirety. But that is why there is a difference. I suggest that such a statement would really be the final statement, and that there is a difference between the interim statement on the commencement date and the final statement on the appointed day.<br><br>
My second point, briefly, is that we do not know when the appointed day will be. Given that the NFC will wind up its financial affairs on 31 March, the appointed day could be 31 July—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is overlooking the fact that clause 39 deals with that possibility. It provides that if a part of a year is left, the accounts for the final part year in which the NFC comes to an end, up to the appointed day, will be prepared in a form to be prescribed by the Minister. They will actually be prepared by the company, which will later receive all the information. But the Minister will be prescribing a form nearly identical to that in which the NFC presents it accounts at present. Indeed, the only possible difference that I can foresee is the length of time that will be covered by those accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to accept what the Parliamentary Secretary says. But clause 39 does not take account of when the rundown to the appointed day starts. There is not to be a statement at that time and also on the appointed day. The NFC can sell off assets at that time. There is no dispute about that. Surely at the start of the rundown to the appointed day, we should be in a position to know what has been sold in that period without having to go back to 31 March 1978, 1980 or 1981—we do not know what the appointed day is. I have listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary. But I am afraid that on the occasion I can see no way to withdraw the clause in the way that I have withdrawn amendments in the past.</span></p>

PAYMENTS BY MINISTER IN RESPECT OF BR AND NFC PENSION SCHEMES.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now turn to part III, which deals with the railway historic pensions. Those are in a very different category from the pensions with which we have been dealing under part II. Both parts refer to relevant pension obligations, but there the similarity ends. That applies to the nature of the schemes, the responsibilities of those running them and—more particularly for the purpose of the debate on the clause—the responsibility of this House and of the Government for the historic railway pension schemes.<br><br>
At present, those who run the schemes, the trustees and management committees of the pension funds, hold a number of documents laid before this House, a number of statutory instruments that give them an absolute and categorical promise on the part of Her Majesty's Government to pay them a number of very large sums of money. Altogether a sum of about £900 million has been promised to them under legislation passed by this House under instruments laid by Ministers. Therefore, those who run the schemes and those who are beneficiaries of them have every right to expect that this House will not do anything that will enable the Government to withdraw from those promises and to get out of their moral and legal obligation to fund the historic railway pensions.<br><br>
In the strange way that parliamentary draftsmen have—another of their conjuring tricks they have called the promises in previous legislation to pay those vast sums of money "funding debts". They may be debts from the point of view of the Government or even of the taxpayer, but for those running these railway pensions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1886</span>
schemes they are promises in the form of a succession of statutory instruments made under the 1974 Act that the Government will pay to them certain capital sums are paid the trustees of the funds will receive interest at a prescribed rate, the cost of this to be met in full by the Government.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
Therefore, those who run these pension funds have been absolutely entitled and in every way justified in considering themselves able to rely upon the so-called funding debts as a form of income to them which was a perfectly good British Government security. Moreover, they have indeed acted in that way. In considering their funds and making their financial arrangements, they had regard to the certainty, as they saw it, of income paid on these funding debts, and have realised that such other provisions as they had to make they would have to make in other ways.<br><br>
Admittedly, there was a time when the actual amount of the funding debts could have been changed. There was a time when, if the actual cost of meeting those historic fund liabilities had turned out to be less than it was calculated to be at the time when the statutory instruments were made, the funding debts could have been reduced. I believe that there were limitations on the amount of the reduction, but some could have been reduced by as much as 20 per cent. But even in those cases, those running the funds had a right in organising their funds' financial arrangements, to bank on at least 80 per cent. of the figure in the statutory instrument covering the funding debt.<br><br>
But the time when the reduction could have been made is now past. Such a reduction can no longer be made. Those running the fund therefore now have the right to expect £900 million worth of assets, represented by those funding debts, to be turned over to them by 1986. That is unquestionably the existing statutory position.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1887</span>
It is therefore not surprising to find that in determining their investment policy, those who have been running the funds have looked to the payments on those funding debts to bring in income for the purposes of meeting fund obligations up to 1986, and have made their other investments in a way that will produce income beyond 1986.<br><br>
What the Government now propose to do will wreck that calculation and what was up to now a perfectly reputable and properly arranged financial proposition on which to run funds. Nearly all of the investments that have been made by fund trustees are of a long term nature. Unless this provision is enacted, therefore, the returns will provide a balanced flow of money from an investment portfolio in which the ordinary short-dated investment, which would be found in other funds without this form of Government backing, plays little or no part.<br><br>
The proposition in the Bill, however, would wreck the assumptions upon which those pension funds are run and on which their financing is calculated, because the Bill seeks to write off those funding debts entirely. It seeks to say that no matter what promises were made, and no matter what was the decision of the House in 1974, the Government now propose simply to wipe out £900 million worth of funding debts and to put in their place something which will be wholly unsatisfactory in terms of the investment policy of those running the funds. It will cause endless difficulties, because it will entirely upset their investment policy. They would have to make a very considerable rearrangement of their existing investments, because investments placed with a view to raising money after 1986 will be of little value to them in meeting a number of financial commitments to pensioners that they will be called upon to meet before 1986. Not only will they have the expenses and duties involved in rearranging their investment. They will run a considerable risk of having to sell those longer term investments at well below their maximum value in order to try to rearrange them to produce shorter term returns. The true potential of that longer term investment may therefore be virtually annihilated by the proposal in the Bill.<br><br>
I turn now to the proposed alternative to the funding debts which guarantee £900 million to the pension fund trustees. All that the Bill does is to give a very vague
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1888</span>
promise that the Minister will pay a proportion of the money needed to pay those historic pensions. It does not say what proportion. If the Bill goes through unamended, that will be determined by the Minister at some future date, after the Bill has become law and has passed beyond the control of the House, and beyond the time at which the House has been in a position to do something to honour obligations that it decided that a Minister should enter into on our behalf.<br><br>
Something which was certain and clear, upon which reasonable financial calculations could be made, and reasonable responsibilities undertaken on behalf of pensioners, will be swept away by the Bill. In its place will be something, the financial effect of which we cannot judge and which gives no promise of anything like a similar safeguard for the funds, the trustees or the pensioners who up to now have been safeguarded by this guarantee.<br><br>
The implications of the Government's proposal go very much wider than railway pensions. Do the Government really wish to create a precedent whereby, a British Government having promised assets to certain people in order to carry out certain duties that the House agreed should fall to them, those promises are then swept away? Do they wish to create a precedent whereby a British Government may annul such promises and guarantees of funds in exchange for something of unknown value? If the House accepts the principle that guarantees given under legislation passed by this House may be swept away, why should not other British Government securities be swept away by legislation proposed by the Conservative Government? Why should they not wipe out Post Office funds as well? Why should they not wipe out guarantees of British Government funds to ICI or any other company? Given that they have a majority and it suits their policy and their financial ends, they may come along to the House and propose exactly that, unless we show on this occasion that we will not stand for such an intolerable situation.<br><br>
If the funding debts which now exist are to be annulled, at the least they must be replaced by something definite and specific that we can judge—something more solid than what is proposed, and which offers a comparable safeguard and security to the members of these funds and their pensioners to that which has existed up to now. I believe that a promise made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1889</span>
by a British Government to a group of pensioners is being broken, and that the present Conservative Government propose to use their parliamentary majority to renounce both their legal and their moral obligations to those people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to reassure the Committee about the points that the right hon. Gentleman has just made. Above all, I wish to reassure him and the pensioners who might read his remarks and jump to the conclusion that their rights are being taken away that that is not the Government's intention. Indeed, a great deal of what the right hon. Gentleman has asserted does not stand up to any objective analysis. To use the sort of terms that he did leaves him open to a great deal of criticism, in the sense that they create alarm when there is no reason for it.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman has been frank about his views. Therefore he will not expect me to be less than frank in saying to him that I believe that what he said is not right, is not covered by the facts and will create undue and unnecessary alarm for many pensioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was being absolutely factual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this debate can be conducted reasonably. The Government are putting forward a policy that of course the Committee will want to consider deeply. I understand that. Clearly the right hon. Gentleman is right in saying that we are changing the arrangements. There is no secret about that.<br><br>
The decision to legislate to change the method by which support will be provided for the so-called historic pension obligations of the British Railways Board and the National Freight Corporation was taken in the light of two separate considerations. The first was that the Public Accounts Committee has raised some valid and cogent criticisms of the funding arrangements embodied in the 1974 Railways Act.<br><br>
It drew attention to the fact that substantial public expenditure was being incurred and that that was being done, to use a jargon phrase "in advance of need". It was concerned that large sums of the taxpayers' money—let us remember that that money was not created by some outside body—were being placed in the hands
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1890</span>
of the trustees of the railway pension funds, and that this did not appear to be necessary to secure that pensions were paid.<br><br>
While funding clearly was necessary in the private sector so that employees and pensioners could be safeguarded against the risk that their employers might run into financial difficulties, this was not the case with nationalised industries, which in the last resort are always enabled to discharge their obligations to their creditors, as the Government ultimately stand behind them in those circumstances.<br><br>
I shall not weary the Committee by quoting at length from the Public Accounts Committee's eighth report of 1976–77 in which it referred to the matter, or from the sixth report for 1977–78. For example, in the shortest quotation that for from the report for 1977–78—the Committee, while making no further specific criticisms, concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"we welcome the intention to review certain aspects of the funding of public sector pensions raised by the British Railways' scheme".</p></blockquote>
I have made no secret of the fact that the second consideration was not specifically concerned with pensions policy. Whether the Opposition like it or not, the Government were returned with a mandate to reduce the burden of public spending. [<i>Interruption.</i>]<br><br>
I can have a knockabout debate with the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), but first I should like to put the facts. He can add his prejudices to them later.<br><br>
It was an essential step towards restoring real growth in the economy to cut back the wholly unrealistic programmes inherited from the previous Administration. Clearly, if we were embarking on public expenditure control and reduced spending, transport had to bear its fair share of those cuts, and my task was to consider the Department's various programmes as a whole, to look for the scope for reductions and to decide what the priorities should be.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
Obviously it was important to take into account the effect that those would have on transport users and on people employed in transport. I do not need to spell out the fact that there are a number of difficult decisions to be made about transport policy. Potentially, cuts can be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1891</span>
made in many areas, but I imagine that Opposition Members would object to many of those. So we came to the conclusion that economies could be made with no effect on those who would ultimately benefit from pensions being paid.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee's criticisms provided the cue for one possibility which gave promise of making a really big contribution without in itself harming the provision of transport, or affecting the position of employees. This was to adopt the policy now embodied in part III of the Bill and to change the method of support for the historic pension obligations of the British Railways Board and of the National Freight Corporation.<br><br>
Part III of the Bill basically constitutes a change in the method—that is the crucial word—by which support is being provided for the obligations which were to have been funded under the 1974 Act, or under the 1978 Act in the case of the NFC. It does not entail a reduction in the effective support that is being provided. It has the advantage that payments by the Exchequer will be made only as and when the pensions to which they correspond come to be paid. It thus meets the criticisms voiced by the Public Accounts Committee of the funding arrangements under the Railways Act 1974, which involved Exchequer payments in advance of need.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) said that our proposals could well be an attack on the principle of the funding of pension liabilities. It is perhaps convenient to make one general point now. Part III of the Bill should not be regarded as a move away from the policy that the pension schemes of nationalised industries, like those of other trading concerns, should be funded. Indeed, to the extent that contributions have been paid and accumulated in funds, it specifically preserves the principle of funding.<br><br>
There is no question of running down the accumulated assets of the contributory funds, other than over the natural term of the pension liabilities to which they correspond. There is no question of paying current pensions out of current contributions by members, or anything of that sort. I know that there is considerable debate going on amongst pensions experts—no doubt members of the Committee will have followed that in the correspondence columns of the <i>Financial Times</i>—about the respective merits of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1892</span>
funding and what is called "pay-as-you-go".<br><br>
The Bill maintains the principle of funding, but it is really concerned with the special problem of the historic pension obligations of the British Railways Board and of the National Freight Corporation. Although it is common to talk about the historic deficiencies in the various railway pension funds, the fact of the matter is that the deficiencies are really in the finances of the board and of the corporation themselves, since the funds are effectively their creditors to the amounts of the deficiencies.<br><br>
The Bill, like the Acts of 1974 and 1978, is intended to relieve the board and the corporation of the costs of discharging their obligations to their pension funds. The Committee will be well aware that the pensions provisions of the 1974 and 1978 Acts did not stand on their own but formed part of a comprehensive financial reconstruction of the board and of the corporation. Our general policy remains that nationalised industry pension schemes should be funded. Let me make that absolutely clear. It is right that the cost of current service pensions liabilities should be met by contributions levied at the time when those liabilities are incurred, so that the full cost of the labour employed should appear in the accounts at the time of the employment and it is fully reflected in the charges paid by customers. The Bill does not affect this. It preserves the principle of funding for the proportion of the historic pensions liabilities that can be met out of the assets of the funds.<br><br>
We have made clear at all stages that it was an essential part of our approach that members and pensioners of the schemes concerned should not be worse off under the Bill than they would have been under the Railways Act 1974 and the Transport Act 1978. The purpose of the Bill, like that of the 1974 and 1978 Acts, is to assist the board and the corporation to discharge their obligations to their pension schemes. It does not affect the entitlement of members and pensioners under the rules of the schemes. Nor does it affect the contributions that they have to pay. Clause 49 puts beyond doubt that the Bill does not affect the obligations which the board and the corporation owe directly to pensioners.<br><br>
Doubtless the Committee will want to debate the clause, and either myself or my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1893</span>
hon. Friend will seek to respond later. But I should like to conclude at this point by saying that what the Government are proposing is basically a change in the obligations that would have been funded under the 1974 Act, or under the 1978 Act in the case of NFC. We are not proposing a reduction in the effective support that is being provided. In terms of risk, it seems to me that the Bill reduces the risk to the trustees and members of the funds, since the scheme involves the Government in accepting total responsibility for a fixed proportion of the liabilities.<br><br>
I believe, and emphasise with all the strength at my command, that we are not proposing a reduction in the effective support that is being provided, and there is no reason why pensioners should in any way be afraid of the Bill's proposals. Their interests are being protected and so, too, are the interests of the taxpayers.<br><br>
That is a reasonable arrangement and I would deprecate any suggestions which would cause unreasonable fears in the minds of the beneficiaries. Their position is not being changed and I am happy and prepared to accept anything that will make that absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a statement straight away as we are talking of beneficiaries. I may be unique in the Committee in that I am a member of this scheme, and should I last long enough will no doubt benefit. But after reading the Bill I have some doubts about what that benefit will be.<br><br>
I do not seek to cause alarm and despondency. No one on the Opposition Benches seeks to do that. But it is clear that we need to look at his clause and argue it out in a sensible manner. Where there are differences—I speak as a member of the scheme—or where there are doubts those differences or doubts should be ironed out.<br><br>
In debating this matter it is necessary to go back as far as 1947. That was the start of the British Transport Commission. When that happened—I was employed during the time of the private companies—there was an enormous number of pension schemes, and that is the whole reason for this argument tonight. The rate in those schemes worked out from a halfpenny or a penny a week and the benefits were based on that. But they were never funded. In fact, the funding neces-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1894</span>
sary during that time was by paying the money to the railways—the old LNER, and so on—and they kept the money. In effect the pension rights were subsidised by the railway company.<br><br>
When the railway companies were nationalised everyone who was paying into those pension rights was, in effect, subsidising the public purse. Had they not been subsidising the public purse the public purse would have had to fund them. The 1974 Act recognised that. It also recognised that it was fundamentally wrong.<br><br>
Under that Act in 1979 there was to be an evaluation across the board. The subject of that evaluation was to look exactly at what the scheme was. Therefore, we could work out unequal payments over a period up to 1986. I understand that that has been swept away by the board, but perhaps the Minister will confirm that.<br><br>
The whole difference between pay-as-you-go, with words such as "emergent costs" and a period of "unequal payments," is this. If I am in charge of a pension scheme and I know that I have unequal payments from now to 1986 I can invest that amount of money.<br><br>
The whole basic argument between those who argue that pensions should be pay-as-you-go and those who argue that they should be fully funded is that under the Bill the Minister has the sole right to say what percentage he will pay and what emergent cost he will pay, but that will not be known until the emergent cost has materialised. That is the fundamental difference in the arguments on unequal payments from now to 1986.<br><br>
One can argue that whether it is £10 million this year or £15 million next year, at least one knows that it is coming. One can actually borrow on that money because one knows that it will be paid, whatever that amount. One can also invest it.<br><br>
The basic fact here—the Minister will agree—is that it is a matter of the Government saving money. We must be honest about that. They do not have to pay such amounts until—excuse the pun—the emergent cost emerges. Under the previous scheme unequal payments were to be made until 1986. The pension fund trustees could meet knowing that in, say, 1981 there would be a known amount. The amount was agreed and the trustees could invest with it, they could borrow on it, and they could fund the whole scheme.

Now nobody but the Minister will know exactly when the emergent cost occurs and what percentage he will pay towards that emergent cost. Morever, he is the sole arbitrator of that decision.<br><br>
I return to the 1974 Act, which stated that the Minister, the trade unions and the British Railways Board would consult together. What is wrong with that arrangement? It would be nice to hear the Minister say, "Yes, I will accept that." This is not a union business. The management, the men and the Government put so much money in. Given that fact, the Minister should not be the sole arbiter. Should he not say so in the Bill? He may say that he intends to do that. But he may go from here to higher places, and the next Minister may not have that intention. Therefore, is it not important that consultation between the three parties to the agreement should be written into the Bill? That seems a reasonable point of view.<br><br>
7.15 pm<br><br>
I am not being alarmist. I am trying to argue rationally. The Bill will change the rules. That has repercussions on investment and such matters. Is it not reasonable for the three parties to consult and see what the situation is, when the emerging cost will be paid, and when it will be calculated? I cannot find in the Bill when the emergent cost will be calculated. Even if I knew that date, could I find when it will be paid?<br><br>
Everyone in the room knows that Governments always pay behind, and never in front. That has an adverse effect on pension schemes and affects the members of those schemes. I am speaking from practical experience.<br><br>
When the Minister was answering my right hon. Friend, he said, not in a derogatory way, that he was being alarmist. That may be the case, though I do not agree with him. I have in front of me a letter from people who I should hardly think are alarmist. They are the chairman of the management committee of the British Railways superannuation fund and the chairman of the members' representatives of the British Railways superannuation fund, who are actively concerned by this problem. When I read out what they say, on. Members will see that they are even less than alarmist. They are concerned. The letter deals with a number of clauses, but I shall read out only those passages that are germane to this clause:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1896</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We were concerned to learn that in some circumstances the changes under the Bill might have the effect at some future date"</p></blockquote>
—of course, that is what we are worried about—
<br><blockquote><p>"of worsening the position of some members and pensioners."</p></blockquote>
People who are administering the scheme have that worry. Is it not right and just that this Committee should make sure that such fears do not materialise?<br><br>
They are not being arrogant arguing a political point. The second paragraph says: "We understand the reasons"—they do better than me. I am a member, but they understand the reasons
<br><blockquote><p>"which have led the Government to propose supporting the historic pension on a 'pay as you go basis' but we are concerned about the rigidity of the particular method which has been adopted in the Bill."</p></blockquote>
Here are people who do not oppose what the Government are doing, but they oppose the method. They are working night and day on my behalf as a member of the scheme. They want to be constructive.<br><br>
They say further:
<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that a more flexible approach would meet the public expenditure requirements of the Government."</p></blockquote>
One can hardly argue that that is against Government policy. In fact, it goes a long way to meet it. But they are worried.<br><br>
The letter goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"(perhaps to an even greater extent)"—</p></blockquote>
so perhaps the Minister and the Under-Secretary may learn a lot by discussing the matter with these fellows. I shall give their names in a moment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a familiar point. I had a meeting with all the interested parties last week. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important that we reach as much agreement as possible. I thought that it was for the convenience of the Committee and for my own convenience that I saw them before this part of the Committee stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that from the Minister. Before he completes his speech, perhaps he will do us the courtesy of telling us what was said. If they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1897</span>
said what was in the letter, it will be interesting to see what adaptations he made to the Bill as a result of his consultations. Did he meet them before the Bill was drafted, or afterwards? Did he make changes? These are reasonable people. They are trying to meet and help the Government. Our job as an Opposition is to try to amend the Bill, not to help the Government. Those people are trying to help the Government. But even they have said that there is an inflexible approach, that it is too rigid and
<br><blockquote><p>"might have the effect at some future date of worsening the position of some members and pensioners."</p></blockquote>
That is important. So I hope that the Minister will tell us what the dialogue was.<br><br>
The chairman of the management committee of the British Rail superannuation fund is Mr. H. E. Kentridge, and the chairman of members' representatives of the fund is a Mr. Gowan. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say about this. It is true that he has travelled far and wide and spoken to many people, but there seems to be a common denominator among all the people to whom he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1898</span>
has spoken: he does not seem to have convinced many. That is sad, because no doubt he tried. I respect him for being sincere in trying. He met people from the TUC, from management and from the unions.<br><br>
I will quote from a report of a meeting that was held by him on Thursday 29 November 1979 at his Department. The union representative who was present said that he and his colleagues were not persuaded, after a long and full discussion, that the risks were reduced. In other words, the risks are greater under this scheme than they currently are. Yet the Minister believes sincerely, I am sure, that he is not worsening people's conditions.<br><br>
I must say to the right hon. Gentleman that I honestly believe that with this method—not necessarily because of the principle—we could easily worsen the conditions of the members of the scheme. He has not convinced the operators of the scheme or the trade unions. If he cannot do that, how can he possibly convince us?</span></p>
