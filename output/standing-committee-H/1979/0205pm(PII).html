	<div class='title'>CERTIFICATE OF INITIAL FITNESS (OR
<br><br><!-- lb --> EQUIVALENT) REQUIRED FOR USE OF PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 15, line 17, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'as a stage, express or contract carriage'.</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting amendment to achieve consistency. Throughout the Bill a distinction is made between the provisions applying to public service vehicles—that is, vehicles falling within the description in clause 2(1) which are at some time used to operate local or express services or to carry for hire and reward under contract,—and, on the other hand, stage, express or contract carriages. They are PSVs actually in use—those are the crucial words—for hire and reward at a particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the Bill, that distinction has been drawn between provisions which bite on vehicles which at some time are used for hire or reward and those which bite merely on vehicles which are actually in use as stage, express or contract carriages. The certificates of initial fitness clearly fall into the first category. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>'as a stage, express or contract carriage'.</p></blockquote>
in this clause are, therefore, wrong. The amendment removes them. As I say, the amendment is entirely technical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 15, line 24, leave out "has" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'was in force immediately before this section came into force or has since'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are taking amendment No. 136, in page 15, line 29 at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1 A) For the purposes of this Part and Part III of the 1960 Act a certificate of fitness issued in respect of a vehicle under section 129 of that Act which is in force immediately before the date on which this section comes into force shall have effect on and after that date as if it were a certificate of initial fitness issued in respect of the vehicle on that date'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My purpose is to clarify the position of existing operators who, on the day that clause 16 of the Bill is brought into force, already hold valid certificates of fitness issued under the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those right hon. and hon. Members who find this part of the Bill slightly confusing, and who find difficulty in understanding the implications of type approval and certificates of fitness, I recommend to visit the motor industry research establishment which some of us visited earlier this week, when some of those matters were made very clear to us. That recommendation would apply also to the TRRL.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause is drafted, it is unclear whether operators would be required, once it came into force, to obtain new certificates for each of their vehicles which already had valid certificates of fitness. It is also unclear whether each vehicle would have to undergo a further test to obtain a certificate under clause 16. It seems right that the position of vehicles now on the road should be spelt out clearly in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that both sides would agree that to require operators physically to visit an establishment and to re-apply for valid certificates which had not yet expired is extremely bureaucratic and, indeed, nonsense. Nor would it be justified to prolong the burden of re-certification for existing vehicles at the very time when, in clause 16, the concept of timeless certification is being developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would ensure that existing certificates of fitness automatically became timeless when clause 16 came into force. Such a provision is highly desirable and quite uncontroversial, and it would be a considerable benefit for the bus industry. In addition, it could avoid an unnecessary bureaucratic waste of time, money and effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that all right hon. and hon. Members on the Committee are concerned about safety. An understanding of the relationship between type approval and certificates of fitness is important in judging the amendment. I stress that this amend-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1027</span>
ment in no way jeopardises the PSV safety standards. The standrads of PSVs on the roads are fully safeguarded by the inspection and prohibition procedures in clause 15, which we have discussed, and in clause 17, which we have yet to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In putting these uncontroversial but important "de-bureaucratising"—if I may coin a phrase—amendments, I ask the Minister to consider them most seriously, as I believe that they can only be of benefit to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure if I can say "de-bureaucratising".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>situation of existing vehicles is of such practical importance that it is right that we spell it out clearly in the Bill. What my hon. Friend has done is right, and I congratulate him upon it. I strongly urge the Committee to accept these amendments.</p>

	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman is wrong. The Chair is neutral in these matters and the emphasis that I place on one word or another is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to take a breath after that. I shall set off down another road. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not like all this heckling. I shall set the scene for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause to which the amendment relates is the most important one in the Bill, because it concerns public safety. We can argue about licensing and regulations, but this clause is about the fitness of vehicles. Anything that concerns that must, quite logically, affect public safety in the widest sense. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the safety of passengers is of absolute and paramount importance. That is why we are arguing for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
the substitution of the word "shall" for "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a tightness of wording in a clause such as this. If we are talking about the fitness of vehicles, we are talking about people's lives. When vehicles are on the road, it is of paramount importance that no chances are taken in regard to their safety and fitness of purpose. No one must be given the opportunity, however slender, of evading the obligations of safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have both indicated that they place a high priority on stipulations of public safety. The Opposition are pleased to hear that and welcome it. There must also be a categorical obligation in the clause, and in the Bill as a whole, to ensure that, whatever changes are brought about as to how we check up on the fitness of vehicles, and however we check up on matters that concern the safety of passengers, no changes made will make matters less satisfactory than they were before with regard to safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I move the subsequent amendment, No. 141, to which the main thrust of the argument applies, we shall argue on the force of the word "shall" as opposed to "may". We are talking about the substitution of one word for another, which is of vital importance. The word "shall" contains an imperative—it expresses a determination to do something or a determination that something shall be done. We are bringing definite factors to bear on the whole process and the whole conception of safety and—the important word—prohibition. Certain things will be prohibited on grounds of fitness, or degrees of fitness, unfitness or degrees of unfitness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are arguing about may look trivial on the surface with regard to one word, but fundamentally they are matters of great importance. I am in the process of arguing that the word "shall" shall be inserted rather than the word "may". "Shall" indicates that things will be definite, it indicates an imperative that things will, and must, happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Categorical imperatives or no, at this point we could conceivably assume that the Committee understands the meaning of two of the commonest words in the English language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy if I could
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
agree with you, Mr. English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman would wish to agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should very much like to agree, Mr. English, since you put it that way. As there is an imperative note in your voice, as in the word I am trying to describe, I will desist in my argument and say that if we substituted the word "shall" for "may" there would be no ambiguity, and a degree of certainty would be brought to bear on the whole operation. In regard to safety and to the fitness of vehicles, that is as it should be. There should be no ambiguity. There are some characters around who will always evade their obligations in order to make a quick penny, and the thing that can then be disregarded, is safety. Therefore, we should tighten up legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess I see nothing about safety in subsection (1). The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) seems to be saying that if an inspector comes to the conclusion that because a vehicle is dirty, for instance, it should immediately be withdrawn from service. In subsection (4) there is a reference to safety, but not in subsection (1). Is the hon. Member saying that if the vehicle is not as clean as it ought to be, or is unfit in another way, it should be withdrawn immediately from service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am not only suggesting that but am asserting it. The words in the margin of the clause say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power to prohibit driving of unfit public service vehicles."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what the word "unfit" connotes to the hon. Gentleman, but it suggests to me that an unfit vehicle is one that is not fit to carry passengers or to be placed in public service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intervention of the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spen-borough (Mr. Waller) is relevant, because we are not dealing only with something that has a defect, since the clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or is likely to become, unfit for service".</p></blockquote>
Therefore we are dealing with two aspects, both of which appertain to safety. The phrase I quoted means that the vehicle has to be examined and there is a likelihood that it will become unfit in the near future. That is the crux of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crux of the matter is whether we are talking about something important, such as the fitness of vehicles. Is that the issue before the Committee? I strongly argue that it is exactly the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was my hon. Friend making the point that there is an assumption that a vehicle must be unfit or potentially unfit? Subsection (1) contains the power to prohibit the driving of the vehicle absolutely. Surely it can only deal with those situations in which the operator would be prohibited from allowing his driver to drive the vehicle for trivial reasons. A subsection which deals with absolute prohibition of the use of a vehicle must at least deal with situations in which the vehicle is unfit or potentially unfit to be on the road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weech</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to that intervention in this way? Subsection (1) makes provision for issuing a prohibition on driving a vehicle absolutely. That is a serious matter. We are talking about stopping the bus and about prohibiting it from being driven:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for one or more specified purposes; or"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"except for one or more specified purposes".</p></blockquote>
I should not have thought that it would be a serious matter if the bus were dirty. But in this context it would be a serious matter because this provision can stop the bus absolutely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that on this amendment we are discussing a word, "may", which should not have been there at all. First, I have to be convinced that there are degrees of fitness. I should like the Minister to dwell on that point when he replies to this amendment. It follows in logic that when looking at a matter as serious as the fitness of public vehicles the word "may" should be eliminated from the clause altogether. A far more definite word should be inserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two questions about the first part of the clause. It affects the meaning of the amendment. Would the Minister define specifically what he means by degrees of fitness. Fitness for what, and under what conditions? I should also like explained for what specific purposes the vehicle is fit or unfit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could the hon. Gentleman tell me where the phrase "degrees of fitness" comes from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That phrase comes from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will stick to his amendment. There will be further opportunity for debate on "clause stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move the amendment for the reasons I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many implications in the word "may" and I do not propose to go into all of them. There is a difference between us here. The clause provides that we must rely on the judgment of a certifying officer. But having relied on his judgment, we insert the word " may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are either serious about the provision or they are not. If they are, they will accept the amendment, which substitutes "shall". If we go to the enormous expense of employing certifying officers to inspect public service vehicles— having agreed that that is necessary— should we not then, supporting ourselves with the full power of this House, say that if an officer observes a defect or says that the vehicle is likely to become unfit for service, he has the power of this House to say that he shall prohibit? "may" is a wonderful word, and, not being clairvoyant, far be it from me to say, " Maybe this Committee may come out in May." The keynote there is "may". If I were to say "shall come out in May", that would be definite. If I say that this Committee may come out in May, that is like being in cloud-cuckoo land. But "shall" implies a definition. That is the keynote of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government genuinely believe in what they are saying—at the moment they are having a sub-committee, no doubt discussing whether to accept the amendment because it lends itself to acceptance—and are genuinely worried about the public and concerned over this issue, there should be no problem in accepting the amendment. There is no doubt that we incur a vast amount of expense to employing public service vehicle examiners. Having employed them, what do we say? We provide that they may take some course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again during our debates the Government have said—and it has been echoed on this side of the Committee— that there is much concern about public safety. If that is so, it would help the credibility of their case if they said in the Bill that the public service examiner "shall" take a certain course of action. "may" means that it may or may not be.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1033</span>
If we include "shall", the examiner will take such a course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am dealing now with amendment No. 139 and I will proceed to amendment No. 141 in due course. Subsection (1) states that the examiner
	<br><blockquote><p>"may prohibit the driving of the vehicle on a road"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>either-</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) absolutely;"</p></blockquote>
The word "absolutely" is positive. Before "absolutely" there is the word "may". How do we reconcile those two words? They are completely different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) for one or more specified purposes;</p></blockquote>
If one purpose is a reason for putting a public service vehicle off the road, how can we reconcile that with "may". Surely our amendment must appeal to the Government. We are saying that having employed public service examiners at great public expense, let us put some teeth into their powers. But one cannot put teeth into the powers of the examiners by saying "You may do this" or "You may do that." But if we substitute "shall" for "may", subsection (1) will read in part as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall prohibit the driving of the vehicle on a road either—(a)absolutely".</p></blockquote>
That is what the Minister wants. As the clause stands it contains the phrase: "he may prohibit … absolutely" which is a contradiction in terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn briefly to amendment No. 141. Subsection (2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A prohibition under subsection (1) may be imposed with a direction making it irremovable unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station."</p></blockquote>
Again, there is no division in the Committee. Our prime interest is the passenger. How, in goodness' name, can one say that "may" is a very positive term? The Government say—the Minister and the Parliament Secretary have repeated it time and again in the Committee—that what they are interested in is the safety of the passenger. If they mean what they say, how can they hand over a situation where an examiner may do such-and-such, or may not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister and the hon. Gentlemen are really interested in the safety of the passengers, for goodness' sake let them accept the amendment and state positively
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
that the public service vehicle examiner "shall" or "shall not" do this or that. "may" is a negative word. I hope the Committee will not accept it. I hope the Government will accept this amendment and do something definite to make credible their claim that they are concerned about the passengers. The only way to do that is to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle, Central (Mr. Cowans), I always feel like, let me say, as there are delicate persons present, the corporation dustcart following the Lord Mayor's show. In that spirit, I refer to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary at the end of his speech on Second Reading. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I reject completely suggestions that safety is threatened. If anything, the Bill will improve the safety arrangements."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 	<i>November,</i> 1979; vol. 974, c.1246.)</p></blockquote>
Clause 17 is fundamental to the question of safety. The provisions of clause 15, which the Committee has approved, without the powers included in clause 17 would be a dead letter. Without the powers given to certifying officers and public service vehicle examiners in clause 17, we would have been wasting our time discussing or dividing on the provisions of clause 15, which now stands part of the Bill. It is therefore most important that we should give serious consideration to the content of clause 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend and I were proposing when we put down these two amendments was to give the certifying officers and public service vehicle examiners duties as well as powers. Clause 17 empowers those officers to do certain things, but it does not oblige them to do them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I really wonder what we are doing here. For all 1 know, we may be repeating earlier legislation, but we all know that Parliament has been responsible for a great deal of very inferior legislation. The fact that the earlier legislation was unsatisfactory is no reason to perpetuate it. Precedent is not always useful in trying to formulate laws which are better than those which have gone before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause stands, there is no obligation on the certifying officers or public vehicle examiners to do the tasks that are allocated to them. Their employers might oblige them to do it by their terms and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
conditions of contract. But there is no obligation on them to do their job, nor is there any obligation on their employers to get them to do it. It appears that we are saying to those who are supposedly responsible for vehicle safety "If you want to do your job you can, but if you do not feel like doing it, you need not". That is a most unsatisfactory situation for the safety of public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the third and fourth lines of subsection (1). It specifies vehicles being, or being likely to become, unfit for service—in some cases absolutely unfit for service. If anybody decides that a vehicle is absolutely unfit for service, in all conscience, the ought to be obliged to prohibit its use, and not be given a discretion to decide whether to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that under the Road Traffic Act 1972 examiners have the power to prohibit the driving of goods vehicles? If we see fit to give the power to prohibit the driving of goods vehicles, is it not of greater importance that we should give it for passenger vehicles if we are interested in the safety of people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept my hon. Friend's point. For while a heavy goods vehicle may cause considerable damage to people, vehicles or buildings if it is not in a fit state to be driven, there are generally a limited number of people travelling in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about public passenger transport where, if the Bill works well, all the vehicles ought to be full—although we all have our doubts about that. There is, as my hon. Friend points out, a much greater obligation on us to secure the safety of public service vehicles even than of heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am never quite sure how to keep in order on these matters, Mr. English, but it seems to me that, when proposing a change of this type, Opposition Members are not necessarily justifying their own wording on all occasions, but are asking the Minister to justify his. The Minister's wording places the discretionary "may" on the statute book in two parts of the clause, whereas my hon. Friend and I would like the mandatory "shall" in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall be in order if I talk for a moment about the consequences of not making the change in relation to the discretion which the Bill gives to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
certifying officer or the PSV examiner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two major factors are likely to affect the discretion exercised by the certifying officer or the public service vehicle examiner. The first concerns the exercise of his professional judgment, if certifying and public service vehicle examining can be described as a profession. Certainly an element of judgment can be developed over the years by people in these jobs. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that certain qualifications would be required before they could take on such jobs. They would therefore be expected to exercise some professional or skilled judgment in examining the vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a professionally qualified person might exercise his professional judgment to decide in the first instance that a vehicle was unfit for service. But if the Bill remains unamended, he could then exercise a further professional judgment and decide that, despite the fact that in his judgment the vehicle was unfit for service, he would not prohibit its being driven. That is an absurd and indefensible situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to impede my hon. Friend's immaculate flow. He seems to be saying that there are different kinds of professional judgment. A professional judgment in the North-East may differ from one in the Midlands or in the South. The insertion of the word "shall" would remove such differences, because it would indicate that the examiner has to do, regardless of such discrepancies of professional judgment across the country. The matter would then be easier to interpret. Everybody will then know what shall or shall not happen, and not just what "may" happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point that had not occurred to me, namely, the exercise of differing judgments in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we all know, regulatory agencies of all types have great difficulty in preventing a certain overfriendliness and slackness from developing in the natural course of human contact in the relationship between the regulators and the regulated. For example, if a certifying officer or vehicle examiner frequently visits a major depot it becomes increasingly difficult for him to continue arguing and having great barneys with those with whom he deals day in and day out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should therefore seek to protect the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1037</span>
position of vehicle examiners against any pressures that they may feel, or which indeed may be deliberately exerted upon them by people whose vehicle they are expected to examine or to certify. We owe such protection to those who will be in the forefront—some would even say in the trenches—in terms of carrying out the job that Parliament has decided must be done and examining the vehicles in question. It is our duty to strengthen their position against the problems that they may have to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it would be substantially to the examiner's advantage if he were able to say, "I am sorry, Jack, but I have decided that the vehicle is unfit for service and I have to prohibit its being driven. That is my judgment. If I say that it is up the creek, I am afraid that that is it. You will have to stop shifting it about the country. It cannot be driven because, in my judgment, it is unfit for service." If we leave him with the present discretion, he will be able to say "Well, Jack, the vehicle is unfit for service, but, as you know, I have a discretion. We had a bit of trouble with those buses yesterday, and I know that you have difficulty providing buses on certain routes. It is all very awkward, and my mother-in-law may want to go shopping, so it is all right this time. I will exercise my discretion to allow this vehicle, which I believe to be unfit for service, to be driven." That is what we shall be saying. We shall be putting these people in the position of being able to say, out of general kindness or as a result of pressure, that, although they believe that a vehicle is unfit for service, they will nevertheless not prohibit its being driven about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, as usual, my hon. Friend is crediting people with the best of motives. He talks in terms of the best possible human relationships between those who are charged with the duty of inspecting vehicles and those who operate them. But if he restricts his consideration in that way he will not fully cover the amendment. In the past, some inspectors have been tempted by bribes. If an inspector has discretion and only "may" take action, there is also a possibility that some unscrupulous person might seek to bribe the inspector. It could be said "Look, you've got a discretion; it might be to your financial advantage to exercise it in my favour."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>
	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, my right hon. Friend has made a good point. It is true that until now I have based my view of the matter on the best possible interpretation of the motives of the people involved, but, as my right hon. Friend points out, there have been occasions when people have been slipped backhanders in exchange for not doing their job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are more easily got at and more easily suborned from their loyalties if they can exercise discretion. When they have no discretion they can say, "I'm sorry, there's now I can do about it. I've got to do what it says. I've got no option. I've decided that your vehicle is unfit for service. It's no good offering me a fiver or a free trip to Blackpool next time you go to see the lights. I can't do what you ask."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further aspect of the exercise of discretion is that certifying officers and public vehicle examiners are not self-employed. Some are employed directly by public bodies. Others are simply certified to do the work, as I understand it—I am not sure that I entirely grasp the details; perhaps someone will correct me if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reductions in public expenditure will bring about pressure for improvements in the productivity of public service manpower. Organisations will be strapped to find the money actually to move buses about. Some authorities are responsible both—indirectly—for funding certain bus services and—more directly—for the provision of examiners and certifying officers. Enormous pressures will be exerted to reduce the numbers of staff used for the job of inspecting vehicles. In those circumstances we could see discretion being exercised in a different way. People will not have sufficient time. If they have discretion they will be in greater difficulty than they would be if they had a firm clear imperative obligation to say, "I am sorry. The vehicle is unfit for service and must not be used."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn for a moment to amendment No. 141, which seeks to substitute the word "shall" for the word "may" in subsection (2). I do not wish to criticise of the Chair; in fact I believe that that would be out of order in advance. Moreover, in view of its distinguished occupants in the Committee one would be loath to do so. However, I find myself in a slight difficulty which I hope that you will appreciate, Mr. English. I had not envisaged that amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>
ment No. 140 would be taken later than amendment No. 141. If I seem to be straying out of order no doubt you, Mr. English, will leap to bring me back into order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and I were proposing the substitution of "shall" for "may" on the assumption that amendment No. 140 would get through. The combined effect would be that a vehicle unfit for service would be prohibited "absolutely" from being driven. The vehicle examiner—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist the hon. Gentleman? If it is for the convenience of the Committee, I do not have the slightest objection to our discussing the next three amendments together with this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it would be for the Committee's convenience, Mr. English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument has ranged wide already, and it would be most convenient if the amendments were all taken together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the exception of my minor incursion on amendment No. 140, I do not think it would help. I shall explain why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman should make an incursion. If it is for the convenience of the Committee, I am quite ready to have the next three amendments discussed with this, but I gather that there is some objection to that on the Opposition Benches. Therefore, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will forget amendment No. 140.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily accept that I am innocent in these matters. I would be loth to cause greater confusion than is absolutely necessary by my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is borne out by the fact that— I shall not mention amendment No. 140 again until we come to discuss it—assuming that there is no other change to subsection (2), we could find ouserlves in the ridiculous position where a vehicle, having being certified by a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner to be so unfit for service that he prohibited its being driven on a road "absolutely", and could be subject to a discretion as to whether it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
was irremovable before it had been to an official PSV testing station. That is a double, possibly treble, absurdity and also what might be described as the spring treble of his discretions. The certifying officer would be exercising a discretion in deciding whether a vehicle was unfit for service. He exercises another discretion which we have to concede to him—that is, his judgment whether the vehicle is unfit for service. We do not have to concede that the examiner, having decided it is unfit for service, has to decide whether it must be prohibited from being driven. If we do not change the Bill we allow him to say that it is all right, if it is put right it need not go into a PSV testing station, despite the fact that he had earlier decided that it was so unfit for service that it had to be banned from being driven "absolutely". I cannot believe that that would be a sensible piece of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, I exhort the Parliamentary Secretary—to accept our point. I recognise that one cannot expect the Government to say "Fair do's, we will sort it out. That is all right. We will accept it tonight"—there may be some ramifications and consequences in later parts of the Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am loth to break into my hon. Friend's discourse which, as usual, is very interesting. But does not the power of his argument have more validity with what we have just heard about the 12 to 18 months of examination of public vehicles? Is it not more powerful to have a definition that "thou shalt" and not "thou may", because examinations take 12 to 18 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's willingness to accept the principle of our new clause, that there should be annual inspections, I feel loth to press him further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, what my hon Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) has said is valid. If we are to make this stick, and go to the lengths of saying that one must have an annual examination, we must make sure that in those annual examinations, and in spot checks, we are imposing obligations and duties on the certifying officers and PSV examiners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a full debate and I am greateful to Labour Mem-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. My hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend would have been capable of raising that point of order himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having grown accustomed to the decencies exercised by the Parliamentary Secretary, I was so astonished by his effrontery that I naturally lost my breath. I would certainly have raised a point of order. I was drawing my remarks to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman appeared to me to be drawing his remarks to a close and I take it that he has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will simply say that I hope that, in the spirit which has pervaded most of what the Parliamentary Secretary has done today in accepting innumerable amendments and new clauses from the Opposition, he will accept the substitution of "shall" for "may" in both important subsections in order to improve the safety of public service passenger transport vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman correctly discerned the effect of the amendments. If accepted they would change the discretion of the certifying officers or the PSV examiners into a mandatory duty to go through the formal prohibition procedure on every occasion when, following an examination, defects were found in a vehicle which at that time, or even in the future, were likely to render the vehicle unfit for service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be going too far and imposing on the vehicle examiners an absolute duty that would be impractical in many cases. It would mean that on every occasion when any defect was discovered which might give rise to unfitness in the future the inspector would be obliged to go through the formal prohibition procedure
	<span class='label label-info column'>1042</span>
with all its attendant paperwork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, under clause 17 (3) a written notice must be given both to the person in charge of the vehicle and the owner. Under clause 25 (6) the traffic commissioners must also be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the defects that may be discovered by examiners on inspection are minor matters—a light bulb might need to be changed; a tyre might be satisfactory, but nearing the stage when it will need to be changed. The examiner needs the range of powers narrated by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) in subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) to use as the occasion demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are various strengths in the power of the examiner. He can issue a prohibition notice, either absolutely or for limited purposes, or he can have just an informal discussion with the driver or the operator and reach an understanding that the defect will be remedied immediately, with the implication that if the driver or the operator is rash enough to ignore the examiner's recommendation, a prohibition notice would be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Labour Members are anxious to secure the safety of vehicles in every way. So are we. But I hope that we can assure them that the powers given in clause 17 to public service vehicle examiners and certifying officers are in line with the powers at present provided for inspectors of goods vehicles when they issue prohibition notices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once more the inspectors are given a discretion. They have an equally important duty to other road users and to the drivers of goods vehicles to make sure that only safe heavy vehicles are on the road, but in practice it appears that they exercise their discretion competently, reasonably, responsibly and without complaint. We can be confident that the sort of people who will act as vehicle inspectors will exercise it equally reasonably for these purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be that the proposed change is unnecessary, as is that recommended by the second amendment, which would go further and insist that every time a prohibition order was issued—that is, every time a defect was discovered that might give rise to problems—that must be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"irremovable unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station".</p></blockquote>
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could involve an unnecessary waste of time if a comparatively minor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1043</span>
defect had been spotted. For instance, as I have already cited, a defective light bulb could be put right on the spot while the examiner is there and the vehicle could proceed on its way. There would be no need for a formal procedure. There certainly would not be a requirement for the driver to put in the light bulb and have it examined at an official PSV testing station. The examiner could inspect it at the time and make sure that it worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the amendments are based on understandable concern for the certainty of safety, I believe that, given the way that examiners will use their discretion under the Bill, that can be achieved without the necessity for the strict measures in every case that the Opposition are recommending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say in support of the amendments that, so far as I am aware, most vehicle inspection is done when the vehicles are off the road—at garage or testing centre—and not while they are in service. Therefore, there would be few cases of vehicles being removed while on public service duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might appear that there is little difference between the intention behind the words "may" and "shall", but in relation to the fitness of public service vehicles it could mean the difference between life and death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An operator can be short of vehicles for a variety of reasons. Lack of spares can lead to cannibalism, which is the moving of parts from one vehicle to another just to keep services running, and perhaps also to hoodwink the PSV examiner. In addition, the recent severe winter, allied to cutbacks in local government spending have led to many roads being full of pot holes, and so on. The cost of that in terms of damage to the vehicles—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>he is a new Member, but I think that he should stick to vehicles and not the roads that they run on.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your kindness, Mr. English. The point that I was leading up to concerns vehicles that could be allowed on the road if "may" is not replaced by the mandatory "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been few major accidents in recent years involving buses belonging to major operators such as PTEs, local authorities, the National Bus Company and the Scottish Bus Group, largely due to the regular programme of extensive maintenance carried out by them. Unfortunately, because of the Bill we can anticipate an increase in the number of operators—particularly of the entrepreneurial variety—who will pay scant regard to the standards of safety. The word "may" will become a loophole through which they will seek to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) made the relevant point that friendships grow up between operators and examiners and that vehicles could be allowed on the road because of that. There is always the temptation to take a chance that nothing will happen even though a vehicle is doubtful. There is also the possibility that an operator will succeed in persuading or convincing the public service vehicle examiner that a certain vehicle may not become unfit for service and that a prohibition order should not be made. It is a necessary public safeguard that the word "shall" should be inserted in place of the word "may".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must accept that this is purely at the discretion of the Chair. We shall discuss the clause again shortly. There are many factors involved. Therefore, the matter is entirely discretionary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 16, line 1, leave out subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 140, in page 16, line 1, after "(1)", insert "(	<i>a</i>)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 120, in page 17, line 9, leave out subsection (8).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The deletion of subsection (2) is proposed for a specific reason. It is to obviate a possible need for operators in certain circumstances to have to send their vehicles upon which a prohibition on driving on the roads has been imposed under subsection (1) for inspection at an official public service vehicle testing station. As was made clear during an earlier debate, such stations would be those either provided by the Minister or designated by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sending of vehicles to external testing stations is a matter of considerable concern to operators. They are concerned about whether there will be a delay in getting the vehicles back into operation. They are also concerned about the difficulty involved in the restrictive nature of the provisions, seen from the point of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1046</span>
view of vehicle owners, as well as operators. They are concerned further at the expense in which they may be involved. That expense may depend to some extent, of course, on the distance of the vehicle from a testing station when a ban is imposed upon it, particularly if there is an absolute ban on the moving of the vehicle. Amendment No. 166 is specific and reflects the general worry on the part of those who own and operate public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment touches also on the operation of the clause which, on a narrow and specific reading, may make it impossible for the vehicle operator or owner to get his vehicle back into operation at all if an absolute ban is imposed. Under subsection (2), as my hon. Friends intelligently noted and as is evidenced by their amendment, if there is an absolute prohibition on moving the vehicle until it is tested at a test station, and if the prohibition is put on the vehicle when it is not at the test station, a narrow interpretation of the clause would mean that it could not be taken to the test station and, presumably, could never be moved again. It might be possible to put the bus on another vehicle and carry it to the test station, but that would be a ridiculous way of dealing with what I take to be a sensible clause and a sensible set of provisions. So in amendment No. 166 there is a serious—and narrow—issue, and a series of serious issues in the broader effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working of subsection (2), which the amendment seeks to delete, is controlled to some extent by subsection (5), which appears to be designed to deal with part of the worry of owners and operators. As you, Mr. English, will have discerned from your assiduous reading of the clause, subsection (5) allows the prohibition to take effect at any time up to 10 days from the date of inspection. It does not have to take place immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was under the impression that the amendment sought to leave out subsection (2). If that amendment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1047</span>
is accepted, subsection (5) would remain in the Bill. Therefore, it must be irrelevant to this discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. English, amendment No. 166, which seeks to delete subsection (2), is being discussed with amendments Nos. 140 and 120, but the effect is controlled by subsection (5). In other words, if the amendment is defeated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is not allowed to do that. He may not argue against his own amendment. He may only argue for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. It has been pointed out to me before in Committee. That is why I am being careful to demonstrate that the argument for the amendment rests upon the disastrous effects on the operation of public service vehicles which will occur only if the Bill is passed in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my train of thought and argument was interrupted by the Division bells, I was seeking to make clear to the Committee that my argument that subsection (2) be withdrawn was based upon an appreciation that the prohibition referred to in that subsection was not absolute and immediate but was, in fact, a prohibition subject to two controls which are outlined in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first control outlined is that appearing in subsection (5), which makes it clear that the prohibition can come into effect at any time following the decision of the inspector or certifying officer up to 10 days after the inspection, and therein lies a difficulty if subsection (2) remains in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no way in which the owner or the operator of the vehicle can make arrangements with any degree of certainty and with any proper regard for the efficient conduct of his business if he is to be left in that considerable doubt. It must be allowed that, even in the best-conducted businesses, the time will arise
	<span class='label label-info column'>1048</span>
when an inspector of the Ministry of Transport—a certifying officer or examiner—may find a defect in a vehicle. The prudent owner, the good business man— with a proper regard for his obligations to his passengers and for his duty, as I see it, to the public of the area in which he operates to provide either for another vehicle to operate in the place of the deficient one or for the vehicle to be repaired and put back into operation—must know with some degree of certainty how long he has to deal with that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can eliminate subsection (2), we can proceed to discuss the clause in a more reasonable and satisfactory manner. If we cannot—if I do not carry the Committee with me in my argument—we shall inevitably be faced with this serious difficulty. It would be bad enough if the owner could be sure of being immediately informed, but he cannot be sure even of that under this provision. Subsection (3) requires that he be informed
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
I put it to the Committee that there is a considerable difference of precision between the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not later than ten days"</p></blockquote>
and "as soon as practicable". But between those limits of the loose wording "as soon as practicable" and the precise wording of
	<br><blockquote><p>"not later than ten days"</p></blockquote>
lies the operating time within which the owner has to deal with the defect of his vehicle. If he cannot deal with it then on a narrow interpretation of the clause, the vehicle can be bound up in the place where it has been certified as being unfit and placed under the absolute prohibition of usage for any one of those reasons laid down in clause 17(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage I will not attempt to deal with the question of whether 10 days is appropriate, because we might turn to that matter in some depth when we reach "clause stand part". I want to restrict myself firmly to the argument as to whether subsection (2) should be made, within the clause, subject to subsection (5) remaining as it is in that limitation, and to turn, therefore, to the effect of amendment No. 140 and, in particular, on the aspect of the clause covered by amendment No. 166.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, amendment No. 140 would limit this prohibition referred to in subsection (2) to those cases where there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1049</span>
an absolute ban on driving. That seems to me to make a lot more sense and to have a great deal of justification attached to it. One can readily accept that the examiners and certifying officers, being experienced practical men with a suitable knowledge of what constitutes a dangerous defect in a public service vehicle, will exercise their judgment as to whether, in making an absolute prohibition under subsection (2), the vehicle is one with a defect such that the prohibition on driving should be absolute as under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) or
	<br><blockquote><p>"for one or more specified purposes"</p></blockquote>
as under paragraph (	<i>b</i>) or
	<br><blockquote><p>"except for one or more specified purposes",</p></blockquote>
as under paragraph (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must be accepted as being the intention of subsection (1). If, therefore, we were to pass amendment No. 140 as an alternative to amendment No. 166—I take it that this is one of the options open to us, Mr. Dean, and that you would permit a Division on amendment No. 140 in the event of amendment No. 166 being defeated—at least we would be able to ensure that the only operators who would be in such an intolerable position by a narrow reading of the clause would be those vehicles with defects such as to cause the examiner to regard them as requiring to be put under a prohibition that would not allow them, in any case, to be driven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a fall-back position. It is not as good from the point of view of a responsible operator as the first amendment, but it has the considerable merit that those operators, the owners, with vehicles being put under the restriction as a result of the clause, the restriction which would allow them to be driven only for specified purposes, could expect that those specified purposes might include the driving of the vehicle to a place where it would undergo repairs, or driving it to a public service vehicle test station. Those would be perfectly reasonable purposes for the inspector to specify. The Minister might tell us whether, as it seems, it would be the certifying officer or the public vehicle examiner who would have the right to specify. At least it would get us over that difficulty if the assumption is right. I take it that the Minister will say something on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pose the question why we should have a prohibition where there is not an absolute ban. There is, to say the least, a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1050</span>
slight logical inconsistency between subsection (1) and subsection (2). Subsection (1) clearly envisages that the examiner may take the view that the vehicle may be driven for certain purposes. Yet subsection (2) makes it clear that, even if the examiner thinks it could be driven without detriment to the public for certain specified purposes, the power is still writ large to impose an absolute ban which
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be imposed with a direction making it irremovable unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station".</p></blockquote>
That brings me to that limitation in the latter part of subsection (2). If the ban is
	<br><blockquote><p>"irremovable … until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station",</p></blockquote>
it is presumably irremovable for the purpose of driving the vehicle to the place where it is to be repaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered carefully the range of repairs that might be required on a modern public service vehicle, and they are very extensive. A vehicle may have been found by the examiner to be defective because of a fault in its electrical system or in its hydraulic system, or because of a defect in its bodywork—or, in the case of the bendy-bus, a defect in the bendy mechanism. I do not want to go into too much detail, but that is the mechanism that ensures that, if the front wheels are turned in one direction, the back wheels will go in another, and thus the vehicle is enabled to describe an arc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Minister that there is not a great deal of experience in this country of repairing bendy buses. If the Minister were operating a bendy bus on a route from Fort William to John O'Groats and it developed a defect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Via Hull?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not say via Hull, because I do not want to go into whether this will be an express service. That would seem to be rather outwith the issue on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to contemplate what those who are expert in these matters and interested in the Bill will think of what he is saying when they read his speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have talked to operators of buses, and I a sure that they will fully appreciate that Labour members of the Committee are prepared to consider the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1051</span>
practical problems that will face owners if a certifying officer or examiner says that the vehicle is to be placed under an absolute prohibition, bearing in mind the complex nature of the modern public service vehicle. We are talking about an investment of possibly £66,000 by a public service vehicle owner in a complex mechanism which requires particular specialist knowledge of how to deal with certain of its faults. I hope that I am being fair in saying that we are talking about vehicles the particular characteristics of which—mechanical, hydraulic and electrical—may render it impossible to repair the vehicle in the immediate vicinity of the point where the absolute prohibition is placed upon their use. Therefore, the owner will be faced with one of two choices. He will either have to have the vehicle taken to a place where it can be repaired by the specialists capable of that, or he will have to bring the specialists with their equipment, if that is feasible, since some of that is rather extensive test equipment, to the place where the vehicle is standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a practical problem and, although it is now 10.45 p.m., I am sure that those members of the Committee who are concerned with the practical operation of these vehicles would greatly appreciate it if the Minister would turn his attention to this particular problem very shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that there will be very few places in this country that will be able to guarantee having the total facilities required to deal with all of those defects which may cause the vehicle to fall under the immediate prohibition. Therefore, if we pass subsection (2) without any amendment, it may be that we shall be piling up the most appalling problems for practical operators who want to ensure that their vehicles always operate in a good condition. If we pass subection (2), on the other hand, subject to amendment No. 140, the problem will be diminished. It will not be eliminated, but it will be diminished on the assumption that the public service vehicle examiner or the certifying officer will allow the vehicle to be driven on the road for one or more specified purposes. If the vehicle is fit to be driven safely without passengers on board, one of the purposes that he may specify could be that it may be driven to a place where there are competent people with facilities for putting
	<span class='label label-info column'>1052</span>
right that vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without labouring that point, I wish to turn to the effect of amendment No. 120 which we have to consider in conjunction with amendments Nos. 166 and 140. We look forward to hearing the views of Government Members who tabled an amendment identical to my hon. Friend's on amendment No. 120. If the amendment is carried, we would a delete a subsection which also qualifies subsection (2). I assume, Mr. Dean, that that was one of the reasons why, in your wisdom, you selected this for debate with amendment No. 116. I assume that subsection (8) would deal with a prohibition imposed under subsection (2) and that is an issue of considerable concern to me and, I believe, to operators. Under subsection (8), there is a condition that the prohibition cannot be removed except after inspection at an official PSV station. That is a matter that raises considerable difficulties. Even assuming that the owner has managed to get the vehicle within the 10 days, or whatever shorter period will be allowed in practice under the clause, to the place where it can be tackled by people competent to repair it, he will still not be sure to get it back on the road or be assured under the narrow terms of the clause that he can have the vehicle inspected and passed because of the effect of subsection (8) which is the subject of amendment No. 120.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to hon. Gentlemen who have tabled an amendment on this point that I presume that they, like myself, looked very carefully at the provisions of subsection (6), because under subsection (8) I am assuming that the provisions of subsection (6) must override and therefore prevent the operator from getting a waiver, if I may put it that way, of the provision—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my right hon. Friend's remarks about the problems of the operator from Fort William to John o' Groats, but I do not think that he finished them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) is right to remind me that I did not finish my remarks about that. I allowed myself to be tempted away from the path of logical development by a desire to make progress on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the point that I should have made is that there is a considerable difference between getting a vehicle that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
stranded somewhere between Fort William and John O' Groats—even if it does not go via Hull, as was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)—to a place where there are specialist facilities for dealing with it and one in Sheffield, which having carried out the experiment, has people with the necessary expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, my hon. Friend and I have been to Sheffield, travelled on one of those buses and discussed it with the operators. I have studied a brief publication on its technical specifications and I should be happy to argue the matter with the Minister if he feels that the point which I am making is not totally valid. However, I do not want to deal with that at any length now because I hope that he has accepted that point at least and that I may now develop the important issue that was spotted by hon. Members on the Conservative Benches as well as the Opposition before our tabling of amendment No. 120.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can observe the difficulty in subsection (8). It appears to work in a way which would prevent the owner from having the prohibition cancelled under subsection (6). Why should it operate in that way? Would it not be better to construct the clause in such a way that subsection (8) would make a specific provision? That could allow the operator to take his vehicle to a place where it can be repaired by the specialist within the 10-day period. If it takes longer, he can apply for a variation of that absolute prohibition, which would enable him then to take the vehicle to the public service vehicle test station. That seems to me an eminently reasonable way of proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is certainly not the way that the Bill goes about the matter. So I join with those Government Members who tabled the amendment in saying to the Minister—or at least I hope they will say— that unless he can give us a justification at least for that part of subsection (8) we cannot support him on it. In fact, there will be a combined vote of both sides of the Committee to take out the subsection. It is a serious amendment to which hon. Members on both sides have put their names.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that I may be wrong in anticipating the reasoning of Conservative Members. They have many more objections to subsection (8) than the relatively narrow one that I have mentioned, as may some of my hon. Friends. However, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
believe that I have said enough to show that the combined effect of the three amendments is such that we have a number of options open to us about how we vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have a number of worries stemming from subsection (2), and we are anxious to ensure that, when we complete our discussions on the clause—I do not know how long that will take—we shall have overcome some of the difficulties, and at least carried such amendments as seem necessary in order to enable it to be operated practically by operators of public service vehicles—operated in a way which will, on the one hand, enable the certifying officer to do his job properly and to stop vehicles being used on the road, particularly for carrying passengers, where there is a serious defect, and, on the other hand, allow the operator to put them in the hands of competent people to repair them and bring them back into service in the speediest possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity of putting a few points to the Committee on this matter. My right hon. and hon. Friends who have supported the amendment were concerned with two matters in connection with the amendment. The two matters are simple points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) described one of my speeches earlier as being comparable to skirt lengths about ladies which one could or could not see. I congratulate him on having such a long gown this evening. One hopes his formality will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point is that we find some difficulty in understanding the necessity for the clause. Secondly, if it is to be included, we are concerned that operators may have to go to specific PSV-designated areas to have quite trivial faults rectified. We wonder whether the Minister would not consider accepting the amendment in the view of our joint concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the clause there is nothing to be lost in the Bill but its inclusion gives rise to certain difficulties. One can foresee bureaucratic delays, as life is not always compounded of "We have to obey the law and therefore take a vehicle off the road to so-and-so". There is a number of alternatives. We could allow people to rectify or have points tested in situ. I should be grateful for my right hon. and hon. Friends' comments on this, but it seems that there would be great advantage to the Bill if the amendment were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1055</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three amendments are grouped together. Two of them affect one subsection and one affects another. I am not quite sure what were the motives of my right hon. Friend in putting down amendment No. 166 or of the Government's amendment No. 120, but amendment No. 140 standing in the name of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Prescott), was intended, as the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) referred earlier in the day, as a strongly probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though we have not yet amended the clause, the Committee and Opposition members cannot be blamed for any of the complexities in the clause. They remain unamended in the pristine state in which the parliamentary draftsmen presented them. I find great difficulty in understanding exactly what the parliamentary draftsman meant when he drafted clause 17 (1) and (2), and subsection (8) is the kind of provision where, at the end, if one added the words "or I will eat my hat" it might make more sense than it does at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 (1) empowers—it does not oblige—the certifying officer or public vehicle examiner, on deciding that a vehicle is unfit for service, to prohibit the driving of it on a road. Subsection (2) as drafted allows an addition to that original prohibition, and imposition to direct that prohibition is irremoveable
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station".</p></blockquote>
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand what the operator is supposed to do if his vehicle is declared unfit for service "absolutely" and he is told that the prohibition is irremovable
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station".</p></blockquote>
if it is not already at an official PSV testing station. The operator has either to drive it or get someone else to pick it up and take it there for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to our arguments on earlier amendments, the Parliamentary Secretary suggested that we were being Draconian in imposing obligations on certified officers and public vehicle examiners when all he was doing was to give them a power. The subsection, unamended, is Draconian and stupid. It is difficult to see how an operator could cope if he had a prohibition with a direction making the vehicle irremovable, if it was not already at the PSV testing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
station. I look forward to hearing some explanation of that from the Parliamentary Secretary and I hope that we shall have an opportunity to come back on his comments. Either my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness and other of my hon. Friends and I are totally misunderstanding what is proposed, or there is something fundamentally wrong with the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and I tabled amendment No. 140 which seeks to restrict the imposition of subsection (2) only to those vehicles which were prohibited "absolutely" from being driven on the road, because that seemed to confine the application of this rather odd subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept some of the Parliamentary Secretary's arguments in reply to the earlier debate on other parts of the clause. We all recognise that there are different categories of unfitness for service. There is the vehicle unfit for service because it is unfit as a vehicle that can go along the road; there is also an unfitness for service because of the appalling conditions of the seats in a public service vehicle; a vehicle could be unfit because it was entirely covered in lewd graffiti because it has been carrying people to a football match or from a Conservative garden fete in Rushcliffe. Therefore, we ought to have some difference in response from the vehicle examiners to the different kinds of unfitness for service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all agree that, if a vehicle is not fit to be on the road because it is not roadworthy, it ought to be absolutely prohibited from being driven on the road. In those circumstances, subsection (2) would reasonably apply, even if it caused great difficulties for the operator. But in the case of the lesser evils of slashed seats, two or three seats falling out, the indicator board being in a bad state, or the inside of the coach being covered with graffiti, a very substantial prohibition like that provided for in subsection (2) seems to be extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that there is not much chance of the vehicle examiner or certifying officer making the prohibition on the vehicle's use irremovable in such circumstances. But, under the Bill as drafted, that is possible. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle, Central (Mr. Cowans) and I therefore wish to confine the power to making the prohibition irremovable to vehicles prohibited absolutely from being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1057</span>
driven on the road. We aim to give the vehicle examiners some flexibility of response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, I have not been very critical so far of the drafting of clauses in the Bill, most of which, roughly speaking, and apart from one or two odd bits and pieces, seem likely to achieve their objectives. But clause 17 as drafted—perhaps this point would be more appropriate to "clause stand part"—does not appear to achieve its objectives. I am thinking in particular of the objectives of subsection (1), to which the Parliamentary Secretary has already referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not speak in any partisan spirit when I say that I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider subsections (1) and (2) again, and possibly some of the other subsections of clause 17, and see whether they achieve the objectives he has set himself. Frankly, I do not think that they do so. I think the vehicle examiner may well feel obliged to exercise his discretion and slap on the notice stating, "You must do X, Y and Z", when a more limited response would be appropriate. But that limited response should amount to more than what the Parliamentary Secretary has previously described as the examiner having a chat with the operator and asking him to sort out X and Y. We must protect the vehicle examiner's position by empowering him to put a prohibition on vehicles being moved about and also to write out a short notice requiring the operator to do X, Y and Z by such-and-such a date—which, as I understand clause 17, he is not empowered to do without going through a long rigmarole. I think it would be better if there were a certain degree of formality in the least forceful response of the public service vehicle examiner or certifying officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 120 proposes the deletion of subsection (8). On the grounds that I find subsection (8) virtually incomprehensible, I support in some ways the proposal for the deletion of that subsection. The prohibition is made under subsection (1) and the direction making it irremovable is imposed under subsection (2). It has not been cancelled under subsection (6) and we ignore subsection (7) because subection (8) begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding anything in subsection (7)".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure where we end up. I have a sneaking suspicion, along with the hon. Member for Meriden, that we end up
	<span class='label label-info column'>1058</span>
nowhere. I think that it would be better if the Minister went away with his parliamentary draftsmen, with vinegar-soaked towels around their heads, and thought out the clause more carefully. Or possibly it is the product of too careful thought and they would be better to think it out less carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) is a bit on the excessive side, but subsection (8) appears to be excessive in the extreme. I hope that the Minister will go some way towards meeting the points that we have made, and possibly reconsider the whole of clause 17. Of all the clauses that I have read in the Bill to date— I am still a few in front of our discussions— this is the worst and least comprehensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had almost a "clause stand part" debate on the meaning of clause 17. My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) asked me to set my reply to his amendment in the context of the purpose of clause 17. We have also ranged astonishingly wide in our debate. A few hours ago we had complete agreement about the importance of the safety of public service vehicles, and unanimity on the importance of proper inspection and prohibition of defective vehicles. That has descended into ridiculous larking about of the sort that brings the House of Commons into disrepute. Operators have substantial capital at stake in their buses and a substantial involvement in the proper operation of the public service vehicle examiner system. When they read the record of our debates, they will marvel at the stream of deliberate gobble-degook that has suddenly entered into them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have agreed clause 15, which gives powers and facilities for inspection of public service vehicles. Those powers will be meaningless if they have no teeth and no prohibitions which an examiner can impose if he discovers that a vehicle is unfit for service. We are dealing with the discretionary power that a vehicle examiner would have to prohibit the driving of an unfit vehicle on the road. The clause follows fairly closely the precedent of heavy goods vehicle testing, which has been found to be a safe, workable and satisfactory system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (2) and (8) relate to the situation in which a public service vehicle examiner prohibits the driving of a vehicle on a road and attaches to that prohibition a condition that it will not be removed un-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1059</span>
less and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station. We contemplate the examiner putting that condition on the prohibition when the defect is one of some substance and where the equipment of the station is required to check that the condition has been complied with. The last Opposition amendments that we debated sought to make the taking of a vehicle to a testing station mandatory in every instance. The Opposition appeared to be arguing that, if a light bulb needed changing, there should be an absolute prohibition on the vehicle until it had been taken to a PSV testing station and put back on the road. They have now turned a complete circle and are arguing for amendments that would take away the right to impose a condition that the vehicle should go to a PSV testing station at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will accept that there can be circumstances in which the prohibition imposed would be of a serious nature and it is appropriate for the examiner to have the power to say "This will not be removed until the vehicle has been to the testing station".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Parliamentary Secretary cast his mind back to a recent occasion when I said that I found myself in some difficulty over discussing the substitution of "shall" for "may" in amendment No. 141, because we had not previously discussed amendment No. 140 which would have confined subsection (2) to vehicles absolutely prohibited? In such circumstances it is a mere technicality that there appears to have been some kind of about-face, certainly by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and myself. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should withdraw that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the prolonged speeches made by both the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). They emphasised in various ways the manner in which it should be mandatory rather than discretionary to impose a prohibition at all and to impose it with this condition. Their argument now is that the condition should not be imposed at all. I see that as a complete turn-round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1060</span>
I turn to the problem that right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition Benches claimed had vexed them, namely, what would happen if an absolute prohibition—or a prohibition containing this condition —were put on a vehicle when it was on the road, away from an official PSV testing station. They wanted to know whether that would mean that the vehicle had to be abandoned in some way or put on to a low loader before it could be moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that hon. Members know full well that that ridiculous situation does not arise with heavy goods vehicles where this form of legislation is quite familiar already. However, regulations will be made under subsection (9) exempting from prohibition vehicles on their way to a testing station. Quite apart from that, it is plain from subsections (1) and (3) that the prohibition, when imposed on a vehicle, can limit the vehicle to being moved for specified purposes. Clearly, it is possible to specify that the purpose is to drive it back to the garage where the defect is to be dealt with. The prohibition can also
	<br><blockquote><p>"come into force immediately or at the end of a specified period".</p></blockquote>
Again, the specified period can be a period which will enable the vehicle to be driven to some convenient place to be repaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is conceivable that in a most extreme case an examiner could find a vehicle on the road in such a condition that he would not allow it to be moved under its own power. A vehicle could be found to have no working brakes. In such a case, the examiner would impose an immediate absolute prohibition and the vehicle would have to be towed away unless it could be repaired on the spot. However, normally the various powers to which I have drawn the Committee's attention, coupled with the regulations we will make under subsection (9), would deal with the matter so that it would be possible to take a vehicle either to a testing station or to a garage for repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn, finally, to the wording of the various subsections and how they hang together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the concerns that has been put to us is whether the vehicle goes to the testing station or whether the testers go to the vehicle. The example of graffiti has been quoted as a possibility. Would the Parliamentary Secretary confirm that, if the defect is one that can be detected readily by a tester away from a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1061</span>
testing station, that would be quite compatible with what is in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it would and I am quite sure that the examiners would not follow the policy of requiring a bus to go to a testing station in order to make sure that graffiti had been removed or that upholstery had been repaired. Clearly, if such over-zealous officials were to start following such a curious policy, it could rapidly be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That power is discretionary for the vehicle examiners to use only when there are serious mechanical defects and where it is the examiner's judgment that he will require the equipment at an official PSV testing station so as to make sure that the defect has been detected. If, in practice, it then turns out to be possible to correct the defect in some other way, or if on reconsideration the condition is thought to be too onerous, subsection (6)(	<i>b</i>)(	<i>ii</i>) gives
	<br><blockquote><p>"the certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner"</p></blockquote>
the power to endorse the notice and cancel the
	<br><blockquote><p>"direction under subsection (2) with which the prohibition was imposed".</p></blockquote>
Finally, subsection (8) in effect underlines what is almost the obvious in subsection (2). Subsection (2) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A prohibition under subsection (1) may be imposed with a direction making it irremovable unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an Official PSV testing station."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (8) goes on to underline the obvious by saying that, therefore, a prohibition subject to that direction indeed
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be removed ֵ unless and until the vehicle has been inspected at an official PSV testing station."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is indeed to state the obvious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To me, as a layman, it is exactly as the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) says. It states the blindingly obvious by repeating the words of subsection (2) with some different, longer and more elaborate language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered this matter, and I am told that the provisions relating to heavy goods vehicles which were put into the Road Traffic Act 1972 by the Transport Act 1978 contain exactly the same words, which Parliament in its wisdom in 1978 thought it necessary to add. There are some doubts
	<span class='label label-info column'>1062</span>
as to whether removing them now might query their validity in relation to the heavy goods vehicle testing arrangements, although I have my doubts about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see that the wording, of subsection (8) does any harm, apart from adding six lines to a Bill of considerable length already, so I do not think that any great purpose would be served by removing it. On the other hand, I cannot bring myself to defend it with vigour, because I cannot for the moment see that it adds anything positively good to the wording already contained in subsection (2). Perhaps I should leave it to the Committee to decide whether to press the amendment. I have sought to find a better defence for that part of the clause, but so far I have sought in vain. I am therefore attracted to my hon. Friend's amendment, for reasons rather different from those which prompted him to put it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the main and important point, I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friends the Members for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and Meriden (Mr. Mills) as well as hon. Members opposite that in practice this will pose no difficulty for operators. It has posed no difficulty for heavy goods vehicle operators, and it is plainly right that there should be first, effective prohibitions on defective vehicles, and, secondly, the power on occasion to attach a condition to the prohibition that it is not to be removed until the vehicle has been inspected at an official testing station. That is what is achieved by the present wording of the Bill. I therefore suggest that the Committee should not press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Parliamentary Secretary stood up, I thought that we had only two problems. I am now convinced that we have more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem was the intervention of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) in the speech of my right hon. Friend for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). The hon. Gentleman asked how people outside would view what my right hon. Friend had said tonight. The hon. Gentleman might perhaps cast his mind back to the time when he signed an amendment but did not speak on it. In fact, so far as I recall, he did not even vote. In considering my right hon. Friend's speech, people outside will perhaps consider that aspect as well. However, unlike the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1063</span>
Worthing, I will confine myself to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary was very good. In fact, had he been defending a case in the High Court there is no doubt that we should have stood up and cheered, not understanding one word. No doubt the jurors would not have understood a word either. They would have said, "Magnificently delivered, but what were you talking about?" That is the crucial issue. That is the basis of the amendment. If the Parliamentary Secretary intended to put into the Bill everything that he said, we might not need any amendments. But unfortunately everything in the Bill is not consonant with what he says. As usual we are seeking to help the Government, to be constructive and to put some sense into a nonsensical Bill. If we did not wish to do that our lives would be easier, but because we are hon. Members who look at Bills and try to make sense out of nonsense we burn the midnight oil by putting down amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with a problem. First, should we completely delete subsection (2)? One can argue that that would be valid. We should also look at subsection (1) in this context. The Government have not accepted the amendment to substitute the word "shall" for "may". The subsection has three paragraphs. Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) says "absolutely". That is quite positive. No deviation is possible. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for one or more specified purposes".</p></blockquote>
That leaves the question open. Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"except for one or more specified purposes".</p></blockquote>
I have never heard such gobbledegook. Never mind—that is the position in subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, subsection (2) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a prohibition under subsection (1)"—</p></blockquote>
that covers paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be imposed with a direction making it irremovable".</p></blockquote>
The Opposition are practical people. Many of my hon. Friends have actually worked in the transport industry for a number of years. I myself did so for 25 years. If we leave the clause as it stands without cancelling subsection (2), what can we understand "irremovable" to mean?
	<span class='label label-info column'>1064</span>
Does it mean that when a vehicle has stopped on the roadside the examiner can say "Ah, under subsection (1) I may or may not prohibit the driving of the vehicle on the road"? He could then look at paragraph (	<i>a</i>)—"absolutely"—and say "Yes, that is covered by subsection (2)." He then looks at paragraph (	<i>b</i>)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for one or more specified purposes".</p></blockquote>
"Yes ", he says, "That is covered by subsection (2)". That makes the vehicle irremovable. We seem to have arrived at a practical decision that leaves an irremovable vehicle on the road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way if he actually wishes to have light shed on the subject? No doubt I failed to shed light on this clear piece of prose when I spoke about it earlier. It is not the vehicle but the prohibition that is irremovable. If the prohibition is one that allows the vehicle to be driven for a specified purpose—such as going to a garage— the result is not to leave the vehicle stranded on the road in the sad condition which the hon. Gentleman seems to envisage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Parliamentary Secretary is very interesting. Nevertheless, what he said does not make a great deal of sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only say that my hon. Friend was crystal clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not looking into a crystal ball. I am looking at what will happen when the Bill becomes an Act and other people—not the Parliamentary Secretary—have to operate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Parliamentary Secretary made that intervention he said a wonderful thing. He asked whether I would cast some light on the hon. Member. That was a good suggestion. Previously he said examiners would not want to stop a vehicle because a light was out. Yet his Department sees fit in an MOT test to take somebody off the road because a light is out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that that is valid but that with a public service vehicle it is not valid? Is he arguing that a private car owner with a shattered light is different from someone driving people who put their faith and trust in him. Is that his argument? I suspect that it is not, but he must be careful in what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1065</span>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say in amendment No. 140 that we must make some sense out of this. Let us say that subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) shall be the overriding criterion. Subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) clearly states "absolutely". Subsection (2) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"a prohibition under subsection (1) may be imposed with a direction making it irremovable".</p></blockquote>
I stop there to make a point. One is saying that, having exercised subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), "absolutely", one then makes the vehicle irremovable. No one in the Committee can disagree with that. If the PSV examiner sees fit to say that the vehicle should not move "absolutely", why in subsection (2) should he have the right to say that the vehicle is irremovable? Surely it is clearer if one takes out subsections (1)(	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an intervention, the Parliamentary Secretary suggested that subsection (2) was referring to the prohibition as being irremovable and not the movement of the vehicle. In the light of what my hon. Friend said, it must surely be crystal clear that, if there is an absolute prohibition on driving under subsection (1), the vehicle is only movable in some way other than by driving it. Therefore, the Minister and, I believe, the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) in pooh-poohing the idea that the vehicle might have to be put on a transporter to move it, have been speaking against the logic of the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention, if it was a sensible intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. If we are told that the prohibition is irremovable, what happens to the vehicle? Or are we talking about the vehicle being irremovable and not the prohibition? The Parliamentary Secretary has made a nonsense of what is happening. To accept the amendment will make the position absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary said two things, one which was highly engaging, and even attractive, and one which was highly insulting to the Committee. I deal with the latter first. He suggested that we are pressing the amendments in a way intended to ensure that his Department's examiners and certifying officers should have no teeth. He could not have been listening to what we have been saying. We have made crystal clear to those
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
who read our debates—Lord help them— that we are anxious that there should be power to prohibit vehicles being driven if they are not safe and would endanger the passengers. But we are anxious to ensure that the operator or owner who wants to take steps to put the vehicle in a safe condition should be able to do so, and should be facilitated in doing so by the wording of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the Parliamentary Secretary which I found most engaging was his suggestion that the way in which to understand subsection (8) was by realising that what it did was to restate subsection (2) in difficult, longer and more elaborate language, thereby making subsection (2) blindingly obvious. We shall have to work that one out. It may be that what is blindingly obvious to the Parliamentary Secretary after 11 o'clock at night is not blindingly obvious to everyone else. But at least it was a frank statement by him, and it can be checked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the difficulty illustrated by the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation. He has shown us—and we are most grateful to him—that the subsections that we are discussing are not the only subsections relevant to the amendments. He drew our attention to subsection (9), saying that it was important to understand that the regulations which will remain under subsection (9) have an important bearing on the matter. He said that they will be used to prescribe the conditions in which a person can drive vehicles and by doing so, will negate, offset and put at no avail the protection provided in subsection (9).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that that is not the best way to legislate. We need a clause that sets out what the Minister proposes to deal with in the regulations. If the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except in such cases as may be prescribed"</p></blockquote>
mean that the Minister will, in regulations, state a series of conditions in which subsection (9) does not apply, and therefore the limitations which we have been complaining about do not really exist, I suggest that it would be better to say so in the Bill and not leave it to regulations to be made after the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not want to put doubt into anyone's mind. I said that under subsection (9) we proposed to make regulations which would permit the driving of a vehicle to a testing station for the purpose

	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
of being tested. It would be illogical not to lift a prohibition for that purpose. That would be covered in regulations under the relevant legislation for heavy goods vehicles. In fact, we are following almost exactly—sometimes with almost too much precision—the precedent of the Transport Act 1978—passed under the previous Labour Government—and in practice it gives rise to no difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the 1978 legislation gives rise to no difficulty in practice, but the same cannot be said of the clause. If it is as simple as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests, and if the only reason for having the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except in such cases as may be prescribed"</p></blockquote>
is to allow the Minister to make a regulation providing that it will be all right to drive the vehicle to a test station, that could easily have been encompassed within the clause. The prohibition on driving could have been absolute except for the purpose of taking the vehicle, when it had been repaired, to the test station to ensure that it was fit to go back into service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have been attacking the clarity of the Bill.

	<p>the provision can be put in a clause where it will stand for time eternal? If it is easy to make a regulation, is it not easier to put it in a Bill? Then there would be no need for the regulation. What a saving that would make.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. What he says is crucial to the argument. I understand that the term "may be prescribed" used in virtually all transport legislation, refers to the making of regulations. Of course, there is a case in parts of transport legislation for having the flexible power of making regulations. When I read the subsection, I assumed that the powers were to be used in areas where the Minister would require a degree of flexibility, where he could make and withdraw regulations to deal with changing situations. But what the Minister is saying does not fall into that category. Surely it is a condition that he will want to apply at any time. It is not a provision that will need to be changed subsequently and therefore it should be included in the Bill. It is a pity that it was not included in the first place as its omission may have conditioned our debates to some extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of delaying the Committee. Again, this amendment seeks clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the intention of subsection (6). I have listened carefully to all the arguments and have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
been assured that they crystal clear and blindingly obvious. As I heard all those statements, I became increasingly doubtful about my level of comprehension of many of the arguments on the clause. I appreciate the principle involved—that one should lay down powers to prohibit the driving of unfit service vehicles—and on that principle there is no disagreement between the two sides of the Committee. A difference, however, appears to lie in the interpretation of the words and the question whether they are consistent with every provision of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments address themselves to a similar concern arising from subsection (6), which refers to notice being given under subsection (3) by the certifying officer who has made an order relating to a bus either "specifying the defects" or stating whether a prohibition on driving shall apply and when it should come into force. It seems that subsection (6) allows a certain amount of variation in that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are addressing our remarks to subsection (6)(	<i>b</i>) which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by endorsement on the notice vary its terms and, in particular—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>alter the time at which the prohibition is to come into force, or suspend it if it has come into force".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can advise the Committee why it was felt that, if a prohibition has already been given, it should be necessary later, on examination, to suspend the prohibition, particularly as it may have been in the case of the famous 1(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to get into an argument about differentiating between 1(	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) or (	<i>c</i>), but would much rather hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about why one should allow a suspension in altering the endorsement of notices that have already been given under clause 7(3) regarding the prohibition on driving a particular vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment appears to be to take away the flexibility in the Bill as it stands. At present it is permitted that, where a notice has specified the terms of a prohibition, subsection (6)(	<i>b</i>) gives power to vary the terms if the circumstances that gave rise to the original prohibition have varied in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
some examples of circumstances in which it would be appropriate to use that sort of power. A vehicle may have been given a delayed prohibition—that is, one that comes into effect after 10 days—when circumstances justifying that prohibition coming into effect earlier may come to light. Conversely, a vehicle may have been prohibited with immediate effect for a range of defects, but the more serious ones are remedied immediately leaving only a minor one that on its own would have justified only a delayed prohibition. In those circumstances, where something occurs after the original notice has been given, rather than to continue to impose on the operator of the vehicle conditions of the notice that are now unreasonable and not required, it seems right to give examiners a discretionary power to vary them in the light of changed circumstances.

It is really designed to enable vehicle examiners to use their common sense and judgment and in particular to use their powers and vary their notices so that unnecessary costs are not imposed on an operator that go over and above the costs that he must meet in the interests of public safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably this concerns the light bulbs in a bus, or something similar not considered sufficiently serious to prevent the bus from continuing for 10 days, under clause 5, during which time the fault should have been rectified. The Parliamentary Secretary seems to be suggesting that this allows him to limit that period. That would seem to beg the question of why it was necessary to write in 10 days as a condition. Why not leave matters to the inspector to write in that condition at the beginning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where a defect is remedied within 10 days, I would expect the inspector to go to subsection (7) and remove the prohibition altogether on the basis that he is satisfied that the vehicle is fit for service, that there is no point in having a prohibition on it, and so he cancels it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the case where the notice has a particular term. To take the example of the 10-day suspension, if that 10-day suspension is put on the notice and then circumstances come to light that indicate to the inspector that matters are far more serious than he realised—if he obtains information about the vehicle that may mean that he had, underestimated the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1071</span>
unfitness of its condition and that a more immediate prohibition is appropriate—he therefore varies his notice. Or, as I said, he can go in the other direction by putting on an immediate absolute prohibition and serve a notice specifying that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But then it is pointed out to him that far-ranging repairs have been carried out—perhaps at the roadside. He has a look at it again, perhaps having been summoned to the spot by the operator, and discovers that all the immediate defects have been dealt with. The bus may be in a bit of a mess and may need to be put into a proper condition to go back in service properly, but he can now vary the terms to make it a delaying notice—a 10-day notice—which, under subsection (7), eventually will be lifted once every defect has been cured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not carry on introducing wider arguments into other hon. Member's amendments. It is true that subsection (1) merely gives an example of a variation of terms, in that the first line of subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) gives all the necessary powers that are required to vary the terms of notice. It should be fairly unnecessary to give an example such as subsection (1). Once again, it is something that follows the 1978 Act of the previous Government. It has not given rise to trouble. However, this is another example of putting amplifying words into a subsection following the previous Government's precedents. So far as the Bill and the policy are concerned, the result is to give a desirable flexibility which, in everybody's interest, it would be wrong to remove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

amendments Nos. 144 and 149 are probing in their nature, as was the case with amendment No. 140.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise why those two savers are included in the Bill—and I believe that there are others—which is to prevent the innocently ignorant operator, or person in charge, who has done his best to make sure that the law is obeyed from getting into trouble because someone else has done something wrong, which may have been contrary to his instructions and the arrangements that have been made. There have been many references to the 1978 Act, and I feel fairly certain that subsection (10) is a Chinese copy of similar legislation over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am a little concerned about the opportunity that might be provided for the shady operator to get out of his responsibilities by putting over a tolerable case that he is doing his best when he is not. Therefore, my delicate probing is to find out what evidence the Ministry of Transport has about the incidence of offences and of people shuffling out of their responsibilities as a result of the protection which is specifically provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be going rather far. Parliament is going out of its way to say that, if one commits one of these offences one is better off than one would be in a plain common law position. It is my understanding that, while ignorance of what was going on might not be a defence against the charge, if one could demonstrate to the court that one had done the various actions mentioned here—taken
	<br><blockquote><p>"all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence"—</p></blockquote>
one would be unlikely to be heavily penalised and might even be found not guilty, despite the absence of this statutory waiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary may correct me on that point, but this seems to be a case where Parliament is being asked to say "We will put these people in a better position than they otherwise would be". Clearly, if the subsection were not included, they would be in a worse position. But they are also in a better position than other people who are faced with the possibility of committing what, in some circumstances, are technical offences and, in others, are very important offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>), for example, could involve serious breaches of the law which endangered people on the roads. We need a strong justification for providing that sort
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
of protection to the operator. In particular it seems to be aimed at allowing the management to blame the man who actually drives the bus, which is always a doubtful proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), but when he says that amendment No. 144 is a probing amendment he is presuming that the Minister can show us some unquestionable justification for the inclusion of subsection (10). I am not in so generous a mood. Certainly I am not convinced by the track record on the Bill up to now that there is an absolute justification for every subsection of every clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in complete agreement with my hon. Friend that subsection (10), which would be removed by amendment No. 144, provides a defence in proceedings for an offence under subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>). Such an offence can be a most serious matter. The offence is causing or permitting a vehicle to be driven in contravention of the prohibitions that we have discussed on previous amendments. We need not rehearse the degrees of difficulty that it gives. We need only deal with one to justify arguing that the amendment need not be regarded as probing but that we might have to push it to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need only consider the case where the prohibition concerned has been an absolute prohibition—a prohibition of which there has been no qualification, mitigation, cancellation or endorsement by the certifying officer. In such a case, the vehicle could be in an extremely dangerous condition. It could be taken on the road having a defect of brakes or, at night, without lights. It could have been failed for any of a series of genuine, serious reasons which, in the view of the examiner, justified him in making an absolute prohibition. I am certain that the Minister will subsequently defend the great discretion which the clause gives to the examiners by telling us that they are responsible, able men, well fitted to have that discretion. If the Minister believes that, he must also believe that, if they put an absolute bar on the driving of a vehicle, it is for good, sound reasons and it would be highly dangerous for the vehicle to be on the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 midnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in those circumstances that the subsection provides a defence. It produces
	<span class='label label-info column'>1074</span>
an interesting defence based upon the person charged proving that
"he took all reasonable precautions and"—
not "or"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence."</p></blockquote>
It is envisaged in the wording of the subsection that a responsible person who had taken all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence nevertheless had permitted a vehicle to be driven in contravention of the prohibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a serious proposition. I do not know how it is brought about, but presumably the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us. If that is what we are asked to envisage, we may have to press the amendment to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's interpretation of the way in which all reasonable precautions can be taken and all due diligence exercised still allows the person to permit this vehicle to be driven in contravention of the clause, there must be a basic weakness in this part of the clause. I hope we shall be given some guidance on how that will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With amendment No. 144 we are discussing amendment No. 149, which is a probing amendment. By saying that I am laying myself open to contradiction by some of my hon. Friends. I believe we should probe with amendment No. 149, because I take the view that subsection (3) is drafted clearly. It states precisely and clearly what the certifying officer or the examiner is expected to do when he prohibits the driving of the vehicle under subsection (1). I have no fault to find with the language of subsection (3). If the Minister had stopped at that point and not written subsection (6) we should not have had any difficulty with that. Where we may have difficulty is in the extent to which subsection (6) appears considerably to qualify the operation of subsection (3) in that it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a notice has been given under subsection (3) any certifying officer or public … examiner may".</p></blockquote>
The subsection continues to say how he can qualify the provisions of subsection (3). He can qualify the granting of the exemption. He can specify the purposes for which this will operate. He can endorse the notice from time to time, alter the effect of prohibition, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a perfectly good justification for dealing with subsection (3) in this way, by having intervening subsections and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
qualifying subsection (3) by subsection (6). But that is not immediately apparent. It seems to me to require considerable justification, and the Minister should tell the Committee why, if he wants his examiners, who no doubt are competent and experienced men, to have this amount of discretion, he has not made it clear in subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the debate on the amendment. It raises a serious issue
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
of the appropriateness of the due diligence defence, as it is known, in clauses 17 and 18. The two amendments have a common link. They are very similar and I make no cheap or easy point about the misunderstanding a moment ago. The arguments are equally appropriate to both amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments query whether it is right for it to be a defence in proceedings against an operator if he can prove that
	<br><blockquote><p>"he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence".</p></blockquote>
I begin by agreeing with the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and his hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) that an offence under clause 17(9)(	<i>b</i>) can be very serious. To cause or permit
	<br><blockquote><p>"a vehicle to be driven in contravention of such a prohibition"</p></blockquote>
can be an act which endangers members of the public and undermines the whole basis of the safety provisions of the Bill. For that reason, the penalty, prescribed by clause 17(9), of £1,000 is the highest penalty in the Bill. That is to reflect the seriousness of the offence in the worst circumstances. Similarly, it is important to have a criminal offence for failing to operate a PSV licenced vehicle without an operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question arises as to whether it is right to leave such serious offences as absolute offences, that is, offences which are provable and carry a criminal conviction and penalties, even in those circumstances where perhaps the person who is liable for the offence was not personally in any way culpable. There are examples where it could be onerous for an operator to be penalised under these clauses when the real chain of events which led to the offence being committed was no fault of his own—to use layman's language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give examples. Under clause 17, it is possible that a vehicle was driven in contravention of a prohibition by an employee of the operator in direct contravention of the operator's instructions to him. Where an operator has given firm orders that a vehicle is not to be moved and he has made sure that the orders are given to and clearly understood by everyone who needs to know, and where an employee, knowing that he is acting in defiance of those instructions, takes the vehicle on to the road and commits an offence under subsection 9(	<i>b</i>), it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1077</span>
inappropriate for a penalty to be imposed upon the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 149 in clause 18. It is possible that the operator's licence may not have been renewed because of administrative error, again, where the employer had given instructions that the licence should be renewed, and because of an oversight on the part of someone in an office those instructions had not been carried out. The danger with these defences is the one anticipated by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South, that they might be used as an excuse by the slipshod or dubious operator to ride out of his responsibilities and avoid criminal prosecution by passing the blame on to others. The defence, in both cases, is carefully worded to try to avoid that danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the usual position in criminal cases of any kind, for the defence to proceed, the burden of proof is put upon the defendant. He has to raise the defence and prove that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence. The onus would normally be upon the person charged with the defence to call evidence to illustrate that he took precautions and to show that he exercised diligence. It would not be good enough to show that he had given instructions. He would have to show care and diligence, and that would include making sure that the instructions were clearly understood and that nothing was left to chance. He would not be able to ride out on a mere suggestion of others' negligence, he would have to establish that negligence to the satisfaction of a court. Where the operator charged could meet that burden of proof and demonstrate either or both of the conditions specified, it would be appropriate for that to amount to a defence to the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South asked whether in such an unlikely situation there would not be such strongly mitigating circumstances that the penalty would not matter anyway, because the magistrates would impose some purely nominal fine, if they imposed a fine at all. That may be right, but the criminal conviction itself would be a serious matter for an operator of public service vehicles. The record of the conviction would show a comparatively slight penalty, but there would be no other way of indicating on the record that it was a technical offence as opposed to the comparatively serious offence of causing or permitting a vehicle to be driven in defiance of a prohibition, or
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>
of operating vehicles without a valid operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend clauses 17 and 18 to the Committee as providing reasonable protection for the genuinely innocent operator—the man who is careful, has tried to carry out his duty and finds himself faced with prosecution through no real fault of his own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Parliamentary Secretary telling us that, while normally the onus of proof is on the prosecution, he regards this matter as so serious that he is, through subsection (10), putting the onus of proof on the defendant? Or is he saying that for some technical legal reason the onus of proof must be on the defendant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the hon. Gentleman afterwards if my off-the-cuff reaction turns out to be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of proof for these offences rests on the prosecution throughout, as in any criminal case. No conviction of any kind will be recorded against any operator unless the prosecution has discharged the burden which is upon it. But if this defence is to be raised by the person charged, he has to prove it himself, because the defence, for which he took all reasonable precautions, exercising all due diligence, arises from facts which are likely to be so much within his own knowledge and based entirely on his own position that it is for him to produce evidence and to prove his defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of proof is only shifted to him for the purposes of this defence alone and—again, I will correct this later if I am wrong—the burden upon him is, in fact, in proving his defence, and is less than that which rests on the prosecution of proving the offence in the first place. In any criminal prosecutions under the Bill, the burden on the prosecution is to prove that the offence has been committed beyond all reasonable doubt, if I may use the layman's phrase for that standard of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be enough for the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence. But it is felt right to put that burden upon him, because only he can raise and produce evidence of the necessary facts to establish that he took precautions and exercised diligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one does not transfer the burden to the defendant to that extent, it is possible,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1079</span>
as the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras South, said for an operator to raise the mere possibility by that perhaps he took precautions or exercised diligence, and ride the case out in circumstances in which he is passing the buck and is not able to produce any substantial evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that makes the position clear, but it is a feature of the due diligence defence which occurs in rather a lot of modern statutes, in that, because of the nature of the defence, the burden of proof to a limited extent is passed over to the defendant if he chooses to produce that defence. With any other defence it is open to him to do as he likes, if it is a straightforward defence that he did not commit the act with which he is charged. So far as that defence is concerned, the duty is less on the prosecution to prove beyond doubt that he did commit the offence with which he is charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary. He is obviously well versed in legal matters. One point exercising my mind is that we do not legislate for the genuine people. We legislate for those who may break the law, because most people who are law-abiding will keep the law, so the legislation is for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would sadden me to close the loopholes for those who may try to break the law. I have said previously that the Bill will allow cowboy operators to move in. The Parliamentary Secretary may or may not agree with that. There is a possibility that a lot of vehicles will be driven by part-time drivers at less than trade union rates, and so on. Subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly drives a vehicle in contravention of a prohibition under subsection (1);"</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, and the Parliamentary Secretary's legal advice would be valuable here, it is the person who drives the vehicle who would be charged, not the licensee. Subsection (10) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence"</p></blockquote>
It seems to me reasonable that if the employer put up notices instructing the employee to do this, that or the other, it could be argued in a court of law as reasonable, cautious and an exercise of all due diligence. On the other hand, cowboy operators will undoubtedly move in, and it is not unknown for such an employer to instruct his driver to get the vehicle home,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1080</span>
although he has many notices displayed in the cab. What of a telephone call in, say, the middle of the M1, or wherever, instructing the driver to get the vehicle home? What is the precaution there? Is that covered by subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>)? This states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to subsection (10), causes or permits a vehicle to be driven".</p></blockquote>
It would be interesting to get the correlation between subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). Subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) leaves the employee open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if that is covered by subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>) so that the licensee can then be charged that he "causes or permits a vehicle" to be used, in that he telephoned an employee and instructed him to drive the vehicle, can he then be charged under subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>), and will subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>) then relate to subsection (10) inasmuch as the licensee can get off the hook very easily?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with the 99 per cent. of genuine people. We are dealing with the possible 1 per cent. who will try to misread and back a bus through the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) takes care of the employee, will the Parliamentary Secretary assure us that subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>) takes care of the unscrupulous licensee who may instruct an employee to break the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add another point before the Parliamentary Secretary replies? In subsections (9) and (10) both the operator and the driver are in Morton's fork. The operator may plead not guilty because he alleges he gave instructions to the driver to keep the bus immobile and the driver did not do so. But at the end of the day someone must be prosecuted. The driver could argue, "I received instructions to take this bus out." Someone is lying. But one must get both of them, because if I gave the Parliamentary Secretary instructions to commit a burglary, it would be no defence for him to say that he was acting under instructions. One must get one or the other, or both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position could often arise where both are being prosecuted. This frequently occurs in lorry cases and in many traffic offences of this kind. Both the driver and the operator can be committing an offence arising from the same set of facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) covers the person who drives the vehicle. Normally he will be an employee, but he could be anyone. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1081</span>
offence is that he
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly drives a vehicle in contravention of a prohibition".</p></blockquote>
That means the driver must know that it is a prohibited vehicle. If he sets out driving a vehicle which he knows is prohibited that leaves no room for any defence about taking precautions or due care. That offence involves straightforward defiance of the prohibition. It is clearly not appropriate to provide any defence to that once the basic facts can be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>) allows—dealing with the case first raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central—both to be prosecuted where the driver has defied the prohibition but the unscrupulous operator has caused him—that is, told him—or even permitted him to do so. The operator is under a duty to stop his drivers defying the prohibition. If the operator turns a blind eye to the fact that his driver has moved the vehicle, the operator is also guilty of an equally serious offence. If both are convicted the court will, presumably, fix penalties according to the share of blame it thinks should be attached to each. If the operator has been an active party, he is likely to bear a larger share of responsibility for breach of the prohibition than is the driver. In the second case, however, "causing or permitting" is a wider range of liability—hence, it is thought, the appropriateness of the "due diligence" defence that we are considering under subsection (10).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the operator will ride out easily by saying that it was all the driver's fault. But over and over again the situation will arise in which the driver is also in court, and is also being charged. An operator attempting to ride out by saying that there was a notice in the cab, or that he had told the driver not to move the vehicle, will therefore be sunk without trace if the driver gives evidence, as in his own interests he very well may, saying that that was definitely not the case and putting the facts before the court. Unless the operator can prove to the court that he did, as he claims, take all reasonable precautions, which would mean telling the driver exactly what was not to be done, one would expect the operator to be fined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has clarified many of the points that I raised. Perhaps he would clarify one more. The clause specifies that offenders

I must confess that I did not thoroughly understand all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that one of the basic arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister has been that we should look to the legislation of 1968 and 1978 in connection with the changeover to the concept of control through a licensing system rather than through the system of licensing individual vehicles. It is true that the question of the operator's licence, and the principle by which we shall govern the change from individual vehicle licensing, will arise when we debate clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern about clause 17 is that it deals largely with powers to prohibit the driving of public service vehicles. We are concerned about how a deterrent can be maintained, and how one can enable the inspectors to enforce the safety standards required by the Bill and by other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 am

We challenge the argument that safety standards can still be maintained—as they were with heavy goods vehicles—by the application of the 1968 licensing principle. The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have both referred to that as an example of the principle governing the area. Even though the Minister had referred to the principle of licensing lorries
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1083</span>
as a model of that which will be laid down for the bus industry, I do not think that my next point could have been raised during the debates on amendments. It would have been out of order. But it would be relevant to look at the Foster report on road haulage licensing, commissioned by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to debate the report fully, but simply to refer to one or two of its recommendations about the operation of licensing. Those may be relevant to the safety issue which is the concern of the clause. It may be felt that this approach is wrong, but I feel that it is relevant both to clause 17 and to clause 18. The report—with its recommendations about the licensing system and safety—seems relevant. The Parliamentary Secretary himself introduced it into our discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that—as far as I can recall, though I am open to correction—the Foster committee report makes no recommendations on the prohibition requirements with which clause 17 is concerned. The report certainly has a lot to say about operator's licences, but that is the preserve of clause 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonably fair point about the prohibition requirements. However, the connection is that clause 17 is concerned with how to enforce safety standards. Clause 17 says that certifying officers or public service vehicle inspectors will be given powers to prevent unfit buses going from A to B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself made clear that the clause allows for a certain degree of flexibility. That was the argument for retaining "may" rather than "shall", and for rejecting other amendments. We understood the arguments in favour of flexibility. But the important point that concerns the Opposition relates to the power of the deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, by making the licence applicable to individual vehicles Parliament took the view that that was a stronger way of enforcing the safety standards required for licensing. The Bill changes that provision. Later we shall debate clauses that give the overall responsibility to operator's licences, as has happened in road haulage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument is that, if the Committee agrees to adopt that procedure as set out
	<span class='label label-info column'>1084</span>
in later clauses, it will be choosing a less safe system. The Foster committee is one committee that has reported on the subject. It is clear that most of the recommendations in the Foster report do indeed relate to operator's licences, which are dealt with in clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attempting, nor have I attempted, to drag out any points on the clause, but a number of interesting points about safety are made in the recommendations and I am trying to be selective by using just one example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that when the committee considered the present system of licensing, with inspections of heavy goods vehicles on a yearly basis, it was concerned that there were not sufficient powers and they are the same as those embodied in the clause—to be able to enforce sufficient safety. One of its recommendations was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a licensing authority should be able to require operators with an unsatisfactory standard of maintenance to produce their vehicles for testing more often than once a year".</p></blockquote>
The point to be made from that is that the general principles governing lorries, to which the Minister referred, are to be applied to buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to the application of licensing in the next clause, but we wish to make the point that to rely solely on that sort of approach and to refer to the experience with heavy goods vehicles on licensing matters as a means of showing how successful that has been is contrary to the evidence. We give notice that we shall want to develop the point about operating licences, but we have made our point on clause 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable debate on the various amendments to the clause, which is certainly better now than it was to start with. Whatever the arguments about confusion, members of the Committee delaying proceedings and so on, it is clear that the clause has been changed quite substantially in parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, the Government have accepted, and both sides of the Committee have agreed, that it made sense to take out a particular passage and that happened with subsection (8). I do not know whether that is a blow for clarity or a blow against the parliamentary draftsmen, but for whatever reason it has clearly made the clause shorter and to that extent it is easier to understand, though by no stretch of the imagination is it one of the easiest clauses to understand. Our differences have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1085</span>
on the matters of flexibility and discretion that should be allowed and that were highlighted by the debate on the words "may" and "shall" and whether subsection (2) was relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay matters further except to say that I do not believe that the Committee will want to oppose clause 17. Whatever our disagreements, it is clearly a necessary clause, we want the power to prohibit vehicles that have been shown to be unfit, which the clause does in its own unique way, and therefore we do not wish to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. The Clerk kindly explained to me—not our present Clerk but the one on the day shift—that amendment No. 151 was not selected because it was more appropriate as a new clause, and I understand that he is redrafting that as a new clause. However, as a new Member I am at a loss to understand what happened to amendments Nos. 142 and 143 which raised points on clause 17 that were not debated. It may be that they were not selected, and I bow to that ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clerk had gone out of his way to draw to my attention the fact that one amendment had not been selected, there seemed a possibility that the other two amendments had simply fallen by the wayside. As those amendments raised points that have not yet been debated, it seems that it might be appropriate for those matters to be made in the debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that those amendments were not selected, and we are discussing clause 17 stand part. However, I remind the Committee that we have already had long debates on amendments to the clause and I will not regard any remarks that have been made on amendments as in order on the stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Dean, and say that our concern all along has been to try to emphasise the importance of the clause because it gives teeth to clause 15. Consequently, there are parts of this clause that we believe should be made tougher and more obligatory than they are in respect of those who are responsible for vehicle examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to that, there is a consciousness among the Opposition—and, I believe, among some Conservative Members—that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
if clause 17 stands as it is, vehicle examiners will be given the choice between a big gun and no gun at all. Therefore I feel that the clause is a wee bit messy. We are committed to getting some powerful teeth added to the safety clauses. That is very important from the point of view of the travelling public—and, indeed, for the bus driver or the man who flags it down as it comes into the bus station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a complicated and unclear clause. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary accepted that in his description of subsection (8)—which has now disappeared—as "crystal clear" after he had fumbled his way through it. Although the Opposition would not want to vote against the motion, we feel that this is a clause which the parliamentary draftsmen might examine further before Report to see whether they can improve it, make it clearer and ensure that it has less double negatives, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points that I wish to raise in this debate. They have not yet been touched on. The first is the justification for the reference to the "ten days" in subsection (5). It seems to me that, for good and defensible reasons, a great deal of discretion is vested in the vehicle examiner about the period in which an operator should be allowed to deal with defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see that there is considerable justification for that. The vehicle examiner—the certifying officer—is the man on the spot. It is he who has looked at the vehicle and said whether it is safe to let it go for three, four, 10 days or a fortnight, or said, "This is serious. The vehicle must stop operating immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of that, there is a fixed limit contained in the subsection, which says, if I read it correctly, that no matter what the certifying officer thinks the notice that he issues has to take effect after 10 days. I should like some guidance from the Minister about the thinking that lies behind that. It does not seem to fit at all well into a clause which seems to depend for its successful operation on our being able to trust the judgment of examiners and their ability to set the conditions for the operation of the prohibition notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I turn to a question that has not yet been touched on—the question of the appeal to the traffic commissioner, which arises under subsection (7). Subsection (7) appears to provide that if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1087</span>
someone is aggreived in any way by the slapping of a prohibition notice on his vehicle or by the refusal of the examiner or certifying officer to shift the prohibition after a certain amount of work has been done to the vehicle, his appeal lies to the traffic commissioner. He may go to the traffic commissioner for the area, and the traffic commissioner then has to judge whether the vehicle is fit for service. If he judges that it is fit for service, he can remove the prohibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This role for the traffic commissioner is rather different from any of the traffic commissioner's functions which we have considered so far under the Bill. From reading the preceding clauses of the Bill, I would have gathered that the traffic commissioner's expertise lay in rather different directions. He judges what fares and routes are appropriate, what relationships between local authorities and operators are appropriate, and what weight should be given to the plans of the county councils in determining routes. Those are the issues with which we would expect traffic commissioners in our county areas to deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens here in practice is that the certifying officer can either put the vehicle off the road or keep it off the road. A person aggrieved by the refusal to remove a prohibition can make an appeal to the traffic commissioners. They will refer the appeal to a second certifying officer, who can contradict the decision of the first certifying officer. Professional people attached to the same department will be at odds with each other over a teachnical decision. Is this not a total confusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch). With his usual perspicacity, he has lit upon a point crucial to the argument about the commissioner's role. I contend that what is outlined in subsection (7) is not a normal role for the traffic commissioner. He will therefore be obliged—as my hon. Friend has pointed out—to rely very much on the view of a second certifying officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing how professional engineers work, I suggest that one of two things will happen. Some professional engineers, particularly if they are working within the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1088</span>
same inspectorate department, are very loath to contradict one another. If that were to be the outcome of this appeals procedure, the procedure would be a total waste of time. There would be no effective line of appeal. On the other hand, there are engineers who feel that their judgment is a personal matter, that their experience of vehicles is peculiar to themselves, and that they have a particular knowledge of a certain type of vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to refer to the bendy-bus again, but there is a number of different types of public service vehicles. One certifying officer might consider himself much better qualified than another by his experience to make a judgment about a certain vehicle. In such a case, if one certifying officer advised the commissioner to waive the prohibition operators might be encouraged to use this appeal procedure. Whenever they wanted to get a prohibition lifted, and could not persuade one certifying officer to do so, they would go to the commissioner and say "Mr. Commissioner, I want to appeal to you". They would know full well that he would go to another certifying officer. Operators have little to lose and everything to gain, but there is a lot to be lost in terms of public confidence in the whole appeal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I for one do not know how I can defend this provision to my constituents. I should have to say, "I am sorry, but under the provisions of the Bill that is going through the House, a vehicle that has been turned down by one certifying officer will not necessarily be put off the road. Under the appeal provision, the traffic commissioner could take the advice of another certifying officer which contradicted the ruling of the first, and the vehicle could be put back on the road. I ask the Minister whether that is a fair reading of the way in which this provision works and whether he will advise us so that we may consider this point further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised two narrow points. Clearly they are additional to and quite separate from those raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East. But I hope that we can cover them on "clause stand part" before we come to vote upon the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that we have almost finished our brisk trot through a non-controversial clause. I am relieved to hear the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) confirm once
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
more that there is no intention of dividing against the clause and that its objectives are accepted by all sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the detailed points raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). It is true that part of the discretion given to the officers allows them to make a prohibition at such time as seems to them appropriate, within a limit of 10 days from when the inspection is carried out, the defect discovered and the prohibition considered. That follows the heavy goods vehicle precedent. It would seem inappropriate and difficult to conceive circumstances in which the inspection of a vehicle can reveal defects which make it unfit for service and where any officer would want to bring a prohibition into force more than 10 days after he has carried out his inspection. If such a case arose and such a thought crossed an inspecting officer's mind, he would probably be looking at such trivia that he had made an error of judgment on the vehicle's fitness for service in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a time limit is allowed and discretion is given to the examining officer, there has to be some limit to it and 10 days seems to be an appropriate passage of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of the appeal procedures. When an operator believes that he has remedied the defect and is entitled to have the prohibition lifted, but the original examining officer persists in saying that the defect has not been remedied, someone has to resolve the impasse. There has to be an appeal procedure of some kind. The traffic commissioner has a general role in many parts of the Bill. But for the purposes of carrying out this role, the clause provides for the traffic commissioner to make an arrangement to have the vehicle inspected by a certifying officer. That gives rise to what in the medical world is usually described as a second opinion and seems to be by far the most appropriate way of sorting out a dispute on which an engineering opinion is required on whether the continued refusal to lift a prohibition is justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the argument closely and I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for giving way. I cannot understand why it is necessary to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"prohibition may make an application to the traffic commissioners for any area".</p></blockquote>
That covers the whole country. Surely it can be better defined. It creates a ludicrous
	<span class='label label-info column'>1090</span>
situation. For example, a vehicle examiner in Newcastle—my constituency—might take a vehicle off the road and the operator might appeal to the traffic commissioners in Devon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who wishes to make an appeal has the right to make an application to the traffic commissioner for any area. So the vehicle is taken off the road in Newcastle, and because of this ludicrous clause the operator then appeals to the traffic commissioner in Devon because the definition of any area is so wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, it is more reasonable to say that the traffic commissioner of that area can decide if a different examiner examines a car. If I knew a traffic commissioner in Kent and my vehicle was taken off the road in Newcastle, it is obvious that I would appeal to the traffic commissioner in Kent. Surely, the wording should be more definite than "any area". Perhaps we should put in "the world".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that it would be unlikely for an operator, appealing against a prohibition imposed on a vehicle in Newcastle, to go to the traffic commissioner responsible for the area of Devon to make that appeal. As the Bill is worded, that is possible, but it would be a somewhat bizarre thing to do. But it would not give rise to any problems, because a traffic commissioner is not obliged to refer to a certifying officer in his own area. So a traffic commissioner faced with a slightly eccentric decision to appeal to him about a vehicle in Newcastle can simply nominate a certifying officer who works in the Newcastle region to have a look at the bus and see what the problem is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is conceivable that certain problems may arise of the kind envisaged by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness, when it is suspected that the certifying officers in a region are in cahoots with one another and one will not allow an appeal against the other. The appellant might then be able to make a compelling case to the traffic commissioner in a distant area to whom he has gone to nominate a certifying officer from that area. But, as far as I am aware, that problem has never arisen under the preceding heavy goods vehicle legislation with which we are dealing, and I believe that the appeal provisions are satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make the matter clear, under the heading "Goods vehicle provisions", there is a further appeal from the certifying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1091</span>
officer to the Minister, but that has never been used in all the years it has existed. So it was thought unnecessary to add that further provision to a clause which is already quite complicated enough. The appeal provisions have proved adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are following the precedents of the heavy goods vehicle licensing system. As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East said, the Foster committee dealt with that system as a whole—the principle of the system of operator licensing. Here we are concerned with the prohibition arrangements. They have not given rise to problems. The minor amendments we have made deal with the odd drafting defects that were discovered in the past. This Committee has made further drafting improvements to the Bill, and I am sure that after the wide-ranging debate we have had we have now improved the Bill to a state of near perfection. I think the time has come for the Committee to decide that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>ance of the maintenance procedures on modern vehicles.</p>
	<p>There are many maintenance systems in modern vehicles which lay down requirements for replacement of much longer intervals than 10 days.

I take a simple example. It would be possible for a vehicle examiner to examine the brake linings and say "They are good for another couple of months' operation, but not beyond that—or another so many hundred thousand miles". That could go well beyond 10 days. Judging from the technical difficulties that have arisen with the hydraulic fluids used in modern braking systems, some vehicle examiners even test the moisture content of braking fluids and lay down their replacement at certain times. The time limit on that sort of change could well run beyond 10 days. I do not believe that the 10-day limit has met a satisfactory explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary.</p>

	<p>that this is a tentative probing amendment. We have ranged from strongly probing to tentative probing amendments and this is the most tentative of them all. I seek information and illumination from the Parliamentary Secretary, although it seems unlikely that either he or the Minister will provide it while they are talking to one another as they will not hear my questions.</p>
	<p>Subsection (3) very reasonably provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person may hold two or more PSV operators' licences each granted by the traffic commissioners for different areas, but shall not at the same time hold more than one such licence granted by the commissioners for the same area."</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
	<p>I have one material query and one drafting query. First, is there any reason why an operator should not have two licences within one area, when it might mean a saving if he had separate operator licences? It is conceivable that elements of bureaucracy could be avoided if the operator were allowed to add to an existing licence rather than have to get another one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am not entirely sure that I understand the drafting of the subsection. The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not at the same time"</p></blockquote>
seems to refer back to the earlier part of the subsection, so that it is not "at the same time" that the operator has
	<br><blockquote><p>"two or more PSV operators' licences each granted by the traffic commissioners for different areas"</p></blockquote>
he shall not "at the same time" as that
	<br><blockquote><p>"hold more than one such licence granted by the commissioners for the same area."</p></blockquote>
I cannot believe that that is what the subsection means but, as it is presently drafted, my construction seems reasonable,—namely, that if operator A has a licence to operate in Suffolk, and a licence to operate in Nottinghamshire, and a licence to operate in Sutton Coldfield, he cannot have two licences for one of those areas, but that operator B, who has only one licence for one area, could, from the wording of the subsection, get two licences for his area. That is how the position appears to me. Surely that is not the intention of this provision.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whoever drafted subsection (3) has a considerable capacity to puzzle readers on this side of the Committee. I was puzzled, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), but it was a different point that puzzled me. As the subsection has only four lines it seems that, unlike others, it is not the model of clarity that it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What puzzles me is why anyone should want to have two operators' licences granted to him in one area. There must be a reason, or there would not be a prohibition. In other words, there would be no need to say that one should not hold more than one licence granted by the commissioners for the same area if something did not flow from the ability to obtain them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading the clause as a whole, I find that the need to have the operator's licence depends on where one has one's operating
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
centre. I take it that one would normally go to the commissioner for the area containing one's operating centre and get from him an operating licence. Why one should need to be restrained from getting two I cannot for the life of me see. There are many things for which I can understand one might want a spare or a standby or even engage in duplication. For two operators' licences in the same area I can see no reason, and I await with bated breath the Minister's explanation, to cover the puzzlement both of my hon Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South and of myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If ever there was a probing amendment, this is it. We are genuinely concerned that subsection (3) will not do what the Minister intends. It is largely gobbledegook. It may be read to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person may hold two or more PSV operators' licences each granted by the traffic commissioners for different areas, but"</p></blockquote>
unless he does that
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not at the same time hold more than one such licence granted by the commissioners for the same area."</p></blockquote>
That is one interpretation, but I am sure that the Minister does not mean that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems reasonable, when we are talking about PSV operators' licences, that we should be more concerned not about the area in which they are granted but about whom they are granted to. Surely that is the crucial object. The crucial matter is this. Are we concerned with the calibre of the person who is applying for the licence, or with how many he has? Let us suppose that the second is the case. The first line of the subsection says "two or more". That could mean two or 2 million—to go from the sublime to the ridiculous. Yet that operator may be the best operator in the world—nay, throughout the universe—yet knowing that fact, we restrict him to one licence in one area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue that, if we judge that the operator is good and should be judged on that criterion, why on earth restrict him to two more licences outside and one in the same area—or, to take the other interpretation, judge that he cannot have one in one area unless he has two in another area? The whole clause is gobbledegook. If the Minister would answer this question and say what he really had in mind in drafting the subsection, it would be very interesting, for it seems to me that what he had in mind is not carried out as the subsection is written.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1095</span>
Will the Minister give me one criterion—that is, is not the most important thing the operator and how he operates rather than the number of licences he may hold in any area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief intervention to ask the Minister to cover another matter concerning subsection (3). I thought that if an opreator wanted to operate in an area one licence would be enough. If he wanted to do so, why have two licences anyway?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter puzzles me. If a person is to obtain an operator's licence he has to be of good repute, good financial standing, have adequate maintenance facilities and other bits and pieces. That amounts to professional and financial qualifications. If a person has all those things that are good enough for one area, surely they are good enough for all areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there are 11 areas. If a person gains an operator's licence in Suffolk, which I shall call area one, presumably he has the qualifications for area one. It follows surely, that he has the qualifications for the other 10 areas. Therefore why does another application have to be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We entirely agree with what the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) said—that it is the calibre of the person that is most important. In fact, the control that we are suggesting is a control closely modelled on the Transport Act 1968, which was introduced by Mrs Barbara Castle when she was Minister of Transport. The first question asked by the hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) was the first question that I asked myself. Let me try to explain first clause 18(3). The clause allows a person to hold more than one operator's licence for vehicles kept in different traffic areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) asked about the reasons for different requirements in different areas. The answer is that in the different operating centres there will need to be the maintenance checks in those operating centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point is that the clause allows a person to hold more than one operator's licence for vehicles kept in different traffic areas, but it prevents a person from holding more than one licence in any one traffic area. In other words, subsection (3) has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1096</span>
two separate purposes. The first provision clarifies; it removes any doubt there might be that more than one operator's licence can be held to cover different traffic areas. In fact, it is arguably implicit that that is implicit in subsection (2) anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second provision of one licence and one only for any person in any one traffic area is of some substance. I shall not pretend that it is the most important aspect of the clause. It is designed to prevent frivolous or confusing applications. An operator might wrongly assume that he should hold a licence for each of his operating centres. He might attempt to gain more than one licence for the same premises and operate more than the maximum number of vehicles which had been authorised by only one licence. These are unlikely occurences but the subsection is helpful in making it clear beyond debate what licences are needed, and where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point which has not been mentioned. The subsection also deals with the definition of a person. We want to look at that again so that there can be no question about the definition of "person" both here and elsewhere in the Bill. Furthermore, the position of partnerships as applicants for the holders of licences is not spelt out and it may be desirable to regularise and put the position beyond doubt. I volunteer to give an undertaking that we shall have looked at that in more detail either by Report or when the Bill goes to the House of Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I seek your guidance, Mr. Dean? My hon. Friend pointed out that the amendment is a probing amendment. I wish to raise a question which relates to the amendment but deals with a term which is not included in subsection (3). What constitutes an operating centre? Clearly that is relevant to the amendment because presumably one would require more than one operating licence if one operated from more than one operating centre, provided that those operating centres were in different traffic commissioner regions. Is that point in order now, or ought I to leave it until clause stand part, given that only one amendment has been selected for debate on the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help, Mr. Dean. "Operating centre" is defined in clause 35. That clause would also give an opportunity of raising that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That begs the real question. What is a place where a vehicle is normally kept, given the very diverse nature of certain bus company operations? I am in genuine doubt about the correct place to debate that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is principally concerned with the conditions attached or requirements placed upon operators in respect of operating licences. It therefore raises a broad and difficult issue which the House has had to consider from time to time on transport Bills, namely how wide should the requirement be for operator's licences. I do not contend that this point has not been raised before in previous legislation or that it is not difficult to deal with. I accept that it is difficult, especially at 1.20 am. My first question is whether it is right that one should confine the requirement to have an operator's licence to people who are operating
	<br><blockquote><p>"stage, express or contract carriage"</p></blockquote>
or should it go wider? It is clearly the case that people operate vehicles, the same type of vehicles in many cases, particularly buses, with more than eight passenger seats, in the course of business, without that operation being within the definition of stage, express or contract carriage. I make it clear that I am taking a wide point. I am not arguing that it is appropriate only to the definitions in this Bill. There are definitions in existing transport legislation and there were definitions in previous transport legislation, which have run up against precisely this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should a licence to operate a vehicle which carries passengers be restricted to these three classes of operation—stage, express and contract carriage? I know the standard answer. It is that these areas are traditionally regarded as those in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1098</span>
vehicles are operated for hire and reward.' I do not think that that is the fundamental answer, unless one takes the view that the only value of the operators' licence is to be a form of regulation on hire and reward operations that is not required on any other operation of vehicles carrying passengers. I do not take that view. On Second Reading I gave the reasons why in this country we have forms of controls upon vehicles that carry passengers. It was one of the few things that I said that met with general agreement in the Chamber. Among the reasons I gave was the combination of the competence of the operator, with the safety of his operation—not a point of controversy in itself. But if that is the justification for having an operator licensing system, that system should go wider than the stage, express and contract carriage area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example would come within the scope of the Bill, if other clauses were amended, and would, at present, run wider than the combined scope of this and one other Bill at present being considered. It concerns the business man who chooses to run buses to bring workers to his factory—a not uncommon operation. There is one in my own constituency which arose because of a serious local problem—the closing of a steelworks in Millom. There were many unemployed workers in Millom and a factory in Barrow wanted workers. It arranged for buses to bring in the workers. It could have done that by operating its own buses. It could have bought buses, new or secondhand, and sent them to Millom each morning to pick up workers and return them at night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would have been a bus operation, in my view, just as worthy of being safeguarded within the provisions of our statute law as some of the operations that we are now considering. But it would not be within the scope of the Bill and of the operator licensing system. I ask why and I do not think that the standard answer—that it would not be regarded as hire and reward—is good enough. It is not good enough for a number of commercial reasons, but I do not rest on those. Hon. Members can form their own views on that. I rest my argument upon the basic justification for licensing being related to safety of operation. A totally safe operation depends, to no small degree, on its being in the hands of a competent operator—someone who is capable of ensuring that those he hires as mechanics and drivers, comply with those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1099</span>
practices which, put together, make for a safe carrying of passengers. That depends on a whole range of skills—management skill, driving skill and vehicle maintenance skill. That is one example which the Committee might consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second example is the driving of school buses—in some ways, a more dramatic example. The school bus is not even within our definition of the public service vehicle in many of its operations, but surely none of us would deny that the operation of school buses should be within the law, in so far as statute law aims at ensuring the degree of safety that flows from having operations in the hands of people properly qualified to operate vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that I pose is the broad and deep question, which has not yet been solved in legislation, whether the study of operator licensing, as proposed in the Bill, or even as in our present law, is the correct one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next question is one that we have started to deal with in relation to the separate licence for each area. At present, that definition within the Bill is one which requires a separate licence in each area in which the operator has an operating centre. It is a strange idea, given the size of Britain, that it is possible, presumably, to operate from a single centre, to send out buses from a central location to the outermost limits of our mainland, and even to one or two of our islands which are connected by bridges, and not to use the ferry system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read the clause in connection with others related to that purpose, and assuming that an operator is prepared to work his buses from one operating centre, it seems that he would only need one operator's licence, even though his buses may run the length and breadth of the country. If he chooses to have two centres of operation, and they are in different regional areas, he will need to operate his licences. That seems a strange way of going about it. Given, presumably, the desire to have a regional element in the consideration, I would have assumed that its justification was that it needed some sort of regional expertise or knowledge of the region on the part of the traffic commissioners to justify his having to issue the licence. But that would not seem to fit in with the way in which the Bill is constructed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask whether the operator's licence licensing arrangement, in so far as it is restricted to regional bases of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
operation, applies to contract carriage operations. As I read the Bill on contract carriage operations, it is possible for somebody to set up the contract and to approach any operator who is prepared to take up and operate the contract for him. Does the regional limitation apply there? In other words, does the operator need an operator's licence if he is operating from a base in the region? Presumably he does. But if he is operating from a base outside the region, running over the border in order to provide a contract carriage service under the arrangements made by somebody who has set up the contract, does that still apply and, if so, why? Or, if not, why not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the awkward question is posed of what is the justification for creating the obligation to obtain operator licences in this way. If there are to be uniform conditions, why not have one standard operator's licence which is valid and usable anywhere in the country? If there are not to be uniform conditions, and they are to vary from region to region, according to the views of the commissioner of the region, why allow people who have their operator's licence in one area to operate in another?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of which I have given notice. What constitutes an "operating centre". Frankly, the definition in the Bill does not help us. What constitutes the place where the vehicle is normally kept, given that one can operate a vehicle around the country and a number of buses do not appear to be garaged every night? In towns I have visited I have seen buses parked at various points. How long must a vehicle be parked in one place before it can be contended that that is the place where one normally keeps it? In fact, does a vehicle have to be taken off the road at all? That is a relevant question when one considers the complaints that hon. Members receive from their constituents about vehicle operators who park their vehicles in the street overnight. I assume that that constitutes a breach of the law in some respect. Is there any way in which the condition of licensing an operator can be brought to bear on that aspect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the questions which appear to be raised by the clause. We debated the narrow issue of clause 3, and I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on the much wider, and in many ways much more profound, first issue that I raised, which bears on the whole question
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
of the scope of the operator's licence, and on the justification for the regional bias or basis in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to reinforce one of the points made by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). I followed with great interest his remarks about the scope of the clause and the question of other passenger vehicles which were not public service vehicles, as defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there is a satisfactory answer, but the right hon. Gentleman's inquiry was valid. If we are concerned about the safety of passenger vehicles it is almost a matter of academic interest whether those vehicles are plying for hire or reward, or are carrying employees in the course of their employment. We are equally concerned that the vehicles are safe, fit, and are being operated in a proper manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Possibly this is the wrong place in the Bill, when we are talking of hire and reward, to incorporate the sort of vehicle that we are talking about. Nevertheless, I hope that we can have satisfactory answers on the adequacy of existing legislation on the carriage of passengers in those vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman specified people carried in the course of their employment and cited the case of steelworks. One often sees double-decker buses being used to carry large numbers of employees around. Cleaning companies do so on a large scale, as do construction companies. There are also school buses which are owned by the schools. Many other organisations own their own buses and, therefore, would not come within the scope of the Bill. But they operate passenger-carrying vehicles, and one would like to feel that at some point those vehicles are subject to more stringent rules than those applying to ordinary commercial vehicles or private cars. I shall be interested to hear what rules exist for ensuring that the vehicles are subject to the sort of inspection that is required under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that clause 18 is perhaps not even the most appropriate place to raise the matter. Clauses 15, 16 and 17 might have been more appropriate, as we are talking about the safety of the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle and the question of inspection of the vehicle, all of which were dealt with in previous clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is more relevant than
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>
considering applying the rules about public service vehicle operators' licences to the owners of those vehicles. But however it arises, it is certainly a question I shall be interested to hear what my hon. Friend has to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred earlier to the different types of licensing system currently in force with regard to lorries and the proposals in the Bill with regard to bus operations, and particularly in relation to public service vehicles under clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice that we have received from the Ministry makes clear that this is a change from the previous system of licensing the vehicles, under which, as I understand it, the vehicle itself had to be licensed by the traffic commissioners each year. A certificate of fitness also had to be provided in order that a bus could be licensed to operate under the conditions laid down in previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18 would adopt the same principles adopted in the Labour Government's legislation in 1968 with regard to lorries, so that direct responsibility would relate to the transport operator rather than the vehicle. That was probably the principle before 1968, but again, the vehicle itself had to have an individual registration. I see indications of dissent. I may be wrong, but the general principle seemed to be that there was individual identification of vehicles for licensing purposes. At any rate, the emphasis was put upon operator licensing. The same principle is now being extended to public service vehicle buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the examination of the lorry licensing system carried out by the Foster committee which was set up by the previous Government to consider road haulage operator licensing. On reading that committee's report some time ago, I was struck by the number of recommendations that it felt were necessary in order to tighten up the system. The report is therefore relevant to the clause before us in that if the same principles are to be extended to this area we should perhaps take the benefit of the advice given in those recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote just one or two out of nearly 90 minor and major recommendations. They are particularly relevant to the maintenance of vehicle safety and to the weaknesses of operator licensing, rather than vehicle licensing, systems. It is interesting to note the points made in that report, bearing in mind the checks provided
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1103</span>
by the 1968 Act and the sanction that could be imposed under operator licensing, namely that if one did not observe the conditions laid down under the legislation one's operator licence could presumably be revoked, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One recommendation which seems relevant was that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"roadside checks of heavy goods vehicles by vehicle examiners should be extended to nights and weekends".</p></blockquote>
That and other references in the report seem clearly to indicate that the system of examination by inspectors is not as good as it should be. Indeed, the statistics for accidents, show that, whilst there was a decline over a period, a plateau has been reached and in some cases the number of accidents is increasing. The committee's judgment was therefore that the present system of operator licences and other checks had not been sufficient and that the checks must therefore be extended. The committee also felt that the licensing authorities, who would be issuing licences as envisaged under clause 18:
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be encouraged in future to give more attention to offences concerning drivers' behaviour since research suggests this is the most important cause of vehicle accidents".</p></blockquote>
The driver's behaviour has been a matter with which we have been concerned, in respect of whether the operator would be able to offer a defence that the driver did not act in the way that he had instructed. Therefore the driver becomes an important part of the case and in the sanction that may be applied the argument would be whether it should be relevant to the driver's driving certificate or to the operator's licence. The sanction on the licence is also an important aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another recommendation relates to that. The committee recommended that action should be taken not necessarily and solely on the driver's licence, but on the vehicle. There should be a compulsion that suspension should relate to the vehcile. An operator would know that after an offence had been committed he could not use the same vehicle to move passengers from A to B, and could not just change the driver. There would therefore be a much more powerful sanction against the vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report has a number of other recommendations that are relevant to the clause. For example:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an illegally operated heavy goods vehicle may be impounded".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
One could carry that argument to a bus. It is not a power which is envisaged in the Bill, except where a vehicle may be unfit. There is also provision in the previous clause on how inspectors may be empowered to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another recommendation is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a licensing authority should be able to require operators with an unsatisfactory standard of maintenance to produce their vehicles for testing more often than once a year".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the once-a-year requirement has not been sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the committee went on to recommend that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"spot and fleet checks should be given high priority even if it means delaying other work done by vehicle examiners".</p></blockquote>
That is another example of where the existing system of inspection and the requirements for certification are not a sufficient deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervene only to make the point that, as we are changing over to an operators' licensing system, perhaps we should consider applying a more powerful sanction than presently envisaged on not only the driver, but the operator and possibly the vehicle too. There could be a slackening of safety considerations, with the one exception about which the Minister made a fair point. EEC regulations require that there should be an annual test. So what was the practice in a number of firms will become a legal requirement for all vehicles. Therefore in that sense the Bill tidies the matter up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the general principle that was introduced by the Labour Government in respect of heavy goods vehicle licensing has a number of weaknesses that have been highlighted in the Foster committee's definitive report. We shall be grateful to hear from the Minister whether we have anything to learn from the report on the subject of operating licences which, while it deals with heavy goods vehicles, is also relevant to passenger vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
