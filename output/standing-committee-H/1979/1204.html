Copies are available in the room. I should also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONTROL OF PESTS AND DISEASES AFFECTING BEES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 9, after "infection," insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or are believed by an authorised person to have been liable to exposure to infection".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 10, after "them", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and others within a three-mile radius".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the amendment is the impression created in the Bill that no provision is made for the destruction of bees that are feared to have been infected. The Minister said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are considering carefully representations only recently received about compensation where unaffected bees might possibly have to be destroyed to create a 	<i>cordon sanitaire</i> round an outbreak of the disease".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 October 1979 Vol.972,c.651.]</p></blockquote>
But for that aspect of destruction for fear that bees may be infected I would not be worried about the fact that no compensation is to be paid. The amendments were tabled because of the uncertainty regarding the intention to destroy, whether bees are infected or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original Bill seemed to indicate that bees that were not actually proven to be infected might be destroyed, but that was not clear. The purpose of the amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
is to make clear that bees that are not actually infected might be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no infection in this country and I would be amazed if on the first appearance of infection, the maximum effort was not made to make sure that it could not possibly recur. There would therefore be substantial destruction of bees within any conceivable distance that could possibly have been infected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances I ask that the Bill should give the authority to the Minister to cause the destruction of bees or other things that could conceivably have been infected. In other words, it is a preventive measure. I believe that the Bill as it stands does not wholly give that power to the Minister, and the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the Minister is confident that he has power to destroy as a preventive measure. However, since the bees would be healthy, I believe that compensation ought to be paid, and that is dealt with in later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD (Mr. Jerry Wiggin); My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson) has raised an important point. We understand that his amendments are well intentioned, but it is a matter of deciding how wide the powers given to authorised persons in the Bill should extend. Under the Bill as drafted, authorised persons can act where they find infection or exposure to infection, which means that, in the view of those people, actual infection is likely to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give power to act where authorised persons find liability to exposure to infection. I do not wish to be legalistic, but that really gives a very wide interpretation to the phrase that we have used in the Bill. I should not like to argue with my hon. Friend about what he means by "liable to exposure".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek powers only where there has been actual proven exposure. To have powers where there is only a possiblity of exposure would tilt the balancd too far. If an authorised person has nothing but suspicion or has found only the most hypothetical risk of exposure it is not right to give him the sweeping powers of clause 1(4). We think that the public need can be met by maintaining observation until the position becomes clear. The question of a "three-mile radius", which is part of the second amendment, is somewhat similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives powers of destruction over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
bees and other things infected and exposed to infection, and we think that those powers are wide enough. They would allow the destruction of bees within a radius of three miles or even more in the case of an outbreak of 	<i>varroa</i> or other disease if curcumstances warranted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend will take the point that the Bill has been phrased in such a way that although the disease 	<i>varroa</i> is the reason for it, we hope that if any other disease should appear, the Bill would also enable the Government to take the necessary action. For example, foul brood diseases are at present controlled by order and it would not be appropriate to destroy bees within a three-mile radius of an infection of foul brood. We think that my hon. Friend's amendment is really going for overkill. The powers in the Bill are already deliberately fairly draconian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Colin Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I quite appreciate the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson) has raised. I wonder whether the Minister could enlarge a little on a Ministry publication on 	<i>varroasis</i> that growers and keepers of bees in my constituency have in their possession. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Transmission by contact during foraging or with other insects is said to be of little significance".</p></blockquote>
That is a broad statement and it is the key to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East. What is the basis, the reference work, for this matter? Can the Minister enlighten us regarding the work that has gone on, so that we can be quite categoric that there is little problem from the spread of infection through foraging?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will understand that we have given an undertaking that we will not experiment on 	<i>varroa Jacobsoni</i> because there is no way of making certain that we could contain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is an inherent difficulty for our scientists in deciding how the disease would operate, were it to come to the United Kingdom. It is known that it is an extremely virulent disease and the technical side of the destruction of the bees is something on which I would not seek to get into a long debate with my hon. Friend this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is true that because 	<i>varroa</i> is coming, so to speak, we have to have the legislation, our Bill is also designed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
cover any other disease of bees. It is in the general context that the amendments were moved and I am dealing with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will feel, after my explanation, that the Bill already gives very substantial powers to deal with the curtailment of bee diseases, and while his wish to see the protection extended even further is genuine and understandable, I hope that he will feel that the Government are dealing with it adequately in the Bill. I ask him not to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend. The reasons for the amendments were not general, but in the specific context of 	<i>varroa.</i> I appreciate that, as the Minister said on Second Reading, the point about compensation for the destruction of healthy bees has come up only recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to feel that my hon. Friend is satisfied that the Bill will give him sufficient powers to stamp out any 	<i>varroa</i> that comes into this country and that he will not have to come back to the House to ask for new powers because 	<i>varroa</i> is rife. If he feels that the Bill gives sufficient power in that way, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 19, leave out "to" and insert "and".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:
No. 4, in page 2, line 19, leave out "to" and insert "or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 5, in the schedule, page 5, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(9A) Payment of compensation for bees or other things subject to control destroyed in accordance with Section 1 (4)".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment should be seen in the context of a situation in which healthy bees were being destroyed as a result of authorised persons acting in an attempt to prevent the spread of disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear whether the spread of disease will be prevented by the destruction of healthy bees. If we are to destroy healthy bees, or bees that could be healthy, as a precautionary measure, I feel that we ought to be prepared to pay compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The admirable reasons for the Minister suggesting on Second Reading that compensation was inappropriate are all valid. I do not deny that it would be proper to destroy bees that had been imported illegally, or those that have disease within their colony. If those situations arise, there is no justification for compensation, because eventually the bees would die and there would be no value in them anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if healthy bees are to be destroyed as a precautionary measure, there is an argument for compensation. My amendment is designed implicitly, rather than explicitly, to provide for that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gavin Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An important issue has been raised by the hon. Member for Fife, East (Mr. Henderson) and the amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland), which are, I understand, aimed at achieving the same end, naemly, not to require the Government to pay compensation in every instance, but to give the Government authority to pay compensation in future should circumstances arise in which the Government of the day deem that to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we earnestly hope that there will never be any question of compensation, because we hope that the disease will not be imported into the United Kingdom. But we cannot rule out the possibility. The fact that the Government rightly see fit to enact the legislation is sufficient evidence that we must be prepared for the worst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are plenty of precedents for paying compensation for disease control— perhaps to people who are much better off than some of the bee keepers about whom we are concerned. There are full-time bee farmers, but they are out numbered by the part-time keepers. However, we do not seek to discriminate between those who make a living out of bees and those who keep them as a hobby. We are leaving that discretion to the Government at a later stage. We certainly do not suggest—to pick up the point which the hon Member for Fife, East rightly latched onto and to which the Minister referred on Second Reading—that compensation should be paid for the destruction of bees that have been illegally imported. Nor do we think it sufficient for the Government to say that they will allow bees to be re-exported. That would not be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
If my understanding of the amendments is correct—that they will not compel the Government to pay compensation in every instance, but will simply allow the Government or a subsequent Government to take a decision without seeking new powers—I hope that the Minister will accept them, with a view to tidying them up, if necessary, on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Colin Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Committee's attention to the position of the apple grower or fruit farmer who maintains a large number of hives in his orchards? For example, a major grower in my part of the world, who has 500 or 600 acres of apples, has more than 200 haves at 60 lbs. each in close proximity. I need not go into the importance of the hives in blossom time. Proper pollination of the apple crop is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That grower points out that it would be galling if a neighbour were foolishly to import bees illegally, which could be infected. The grower could lose his entire stock of bees. That would have a considerable run-on effect, and it may be worth bearing that in mind when considering discretionary powers for compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with amendment No. 3, we are taking amendments No. 4. No. 5 in the name of the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Marland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill to extend the power of the Minister to take action to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases of bees into Great Britain. I hope that the strengthening of the existing provisions will result in the enforcement of the highest standards of protection for commercial bee farmers against disease—notably the parasite mite 	<i>varroa Jacobsoni,</i> which has now spread to Western Europe and for which there is no known cure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one point about which bee farmers are concerned and about which we have already heard a little. The Bill precludes the possibility of compensation in respect of action by persons authorised by the Minister to destroy any bees, combs, hives or bee products found to be infected or to have been exposed to infection by specified pests or diseases. In a case of 	<i>varroa,</i> the question of compensation would arise only if the protec-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
tion measures failed and the disease spread to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I earnestly trust that the Minister will do everything possible, with the benefit of the new powers, to ensure that that does not happen. Although bee farmers hope that the disease control measures will be completely successful, regards must be given to the possibility, however remote, that at sometime in the future they will not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to the Minister's remarks on Second Reading, many bee farmers depend to a significant extent on bee keeping for their livelihood. In accordance with the precedents contained in the disease of animals legislation for example, where cattle are infected with brucellosis, I consider that the possibility of compensation being paid to producers whose bees, hives and so on are compulsorily destroyed should be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some bee disease, especially 	<i>varroa</i> are difficult to detect, and can take many years to eradicate. The fullest co-operation of bee farmers in disease control must, therefore, be encouraged. For those reasons I urge the Committee to support my amendments No. 4 and No. 5 which would not oblige Ministers to make compensation available at sometime in the future, but would allow them a discretion to do so should they consider the situation warranted such action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the thoughts behind the amendments of my hon. Friends and the points made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang). He is right in his interpretation that amendemnts No. 3 and No. 4, which have identical effects, would merely remove the prohibition in the Bill on the payment of compensation. They would not necessarily enable compensation to be paid, because apparently such matters need to be explicitly provided for in Bills, but if one of the amendments were adopted in conjunction with amendment No. 5 compensation could be provided for in orders under clause 1 of the Bill. I hope that that makes the position clearer in relation to status of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given serious consideration to the questions whether the Government should alter their policy of not paying compensation for bees compulsorily destroyed in pursuit of disease control. I have decided that our policies should not be changed. In introducing the Bill and providing the means for stricter control of imports, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Government have already gone a long way towards meeting the demands of the bee keepers' associations and the National Farmers Union. Although I said on Second Reading that representations had only recently been received, there has never been compensation for the destruction of bees and the bee-keeping associations could not reasonably have expected a new principle in the Bill. Therefore the question of timing does not come into the matter. When the Bill had its Second Reading, we had only just received representations and I therefore made that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is correct in saying that there has never been compensation for the destruction of bees, the principle has certainly been established for all sorts of other agricultural livestock. The one that comes to mind is cattle with foot and mouth disease or brucellosis. If the Minister is to stick to the principle of no compensation where will that leave farmers with cattle in such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an argument both ways on this matter, because there are other areas in which no compensation is paid, and since they all involve extremely long Latin names I shall not read them out. For instance, there are four or five areas, particularly in the plant world, where no compensation is paid. It is not a new principle. Compensation has never been paid for bee disease control. It is not unreasonable to discuss the reasons for that. Previous Governments have had thoughts on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the principle of taking someone else's property confiscation, and could that not have repercussions in other legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One must clear one's mind as to what is happening here. If the Government take action, it is to protect the bee industry. The Bill has been introduced at its request, and rightly so, to help the industry to help itself. It is not the great wicked Government clming ni and doing something that no one wants. The legisation is wanted by the bee industry, rightly in my view, which is why we are giving Government time for the Bill. The question whether compensation should be paid applies in just the same way to the other areas in which no compensation has

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
been paid and where the position has been accepted for many years.

Clearly there is a question here as to what level bee keeping is a commercial enterprise, and, indeed, the sort of losses that bee keepers might be expected to carry. It is not unreasonable to take the view that the disease is a commercial risk. I hope that it is a remote one, and the purpose of the Bill is to make it even remoter.

The cost of insurance should be very small. The hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) is not with us, but he foamed at the mouth when I discussed the question of insurance on Second Reading, fearing that I might secretly have advertised some organisation or other. It is well known that bee keepers have a co-operative insurance against foul brood disease, and although we have briefly discussed with them on the telephone the possibility of extending that insurance to cover 	<i>varroa,</i> they have not yet had a chance to consider it. I have no doubt that they will consider it and that the premiums would be very small in terms of the risk. That is not an area into which the Government ought suddenly to intervene anew.

It has been represented to me that without compensation, bee keepers might conceal the presence of serious diseases. I think that a small industry like the bee industry should be able to recognise and deal with such self-interest and shortsightedness among its members. The best way to deal with the problem, if it arose, would be for the bee keepers to deal with it, as other aspects of agriculture and horticulture are dealt with, by the modest insurance premiums that should be payable.

I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment, for two reasons—first the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
technical reason, which I have outlined, and secondly, because we think that the new principle that the amendment seeks to introduce into bee keeping is neither required nor expected at a time of great Government constraint in all areas of expenditure, however modest. I hope that my hon. Friends will support the Government's line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister carefully, and am not fully convinced by his arguments.
