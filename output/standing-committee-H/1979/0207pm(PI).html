	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 189 proposed</i> [	<i>This day</i>], in page 21, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>aa</i>)that 5 per cent., or such percentage as the Minister may determine by regulation, of the vehicles of a licence holder have, on inspection by a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner, been notified as unfit for service within the preceding six months.".—[	<i>Mr. Dobson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome everybody back to the Committee. It is very pleasing that we are all back in time, although my hon. Friends and I have waited some time to welcome the Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the effect of the amendment not being carried. Here I part company, very slightly, with my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), who is a very honourable man who diligently pursues these matters—I should not want to part company too far from him. My difference arises over the extent to which amendment No. 189 is a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probing to the extent that we are talking about
	<br><blockquote><p>"5 per cent., or such percentage as the Minister may determine".</p></blockquote>
In my view that is the end of the probing part of the amendment, because then we come to the serious part. Although we are prepared to talk about the size of the percentage we are not prepared—I am sure that this is what my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South meant—to sell the principle of unfit vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1192</span>
We are entitled to ask the Minister where he stands on this issue. We are trying to be very specific in giving a remit to the traffic commissioners on unfit vehicles. It seems highly likely that the amendment will not be carried. However, we have seen some deathbed conversions already. This may be another. We are rapidly running out of deathbeds. Let us hope that we do not run out of conversions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning we were all in danger of becoming grandfathers before the Bill ended. Now we are approaching our deathbeds. We are perhaps straying a little from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make the point that I hope that we shall all become grandfathers before we reach our deathbeds. Let us hope that the conversion takes place, gradual as it may be, long before we reach a deathbeds or become grandfathers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen closely to the Minister's reply, but if the amendment is not accepted we shall not know the Government's attitude to unfit vehicles, because the Bill leaves the position so open as to be unbelievable. If the Minister honestly shares the Opposition's concern about unfit vehicles, it will be interesting to hear what argument he can advance against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be seen, nay, to be recorded, in the Bill itself as expressing our concern about unfit vehicles. Is there any member of the Committee who for one moment would advocate that we should allow unfit vehicles? I do not think so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to where we deviate. The Opposition wish to be specific. We wish to carry the amendment and to make clear to the traffic commissioners their remit and the function they are to exercise. If we do that, we shall have credibility outside this place. Surely when discussing a Bill we must be concerned about how it will work as an Act. We must therefore have credibility. We must make it clear that we are so concerned about unfit vehicles that we have made this specific provision in the Bill and we expect the traffic commissioners to carry it out. That will give credibility. But if we say that there shall be penalties for unfit vehicles but are then so vague about the remit of the traffic commissioners, where the credibility will be lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not rely, as has been his wont so far, on words about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1193</span>
the previous conduct of a person in relation to any business involving the operation of vehicles, because that is not sufficient. It is not specific. It is open to abuse, and it does not meet the concern of the Opposition. The Minister has repeatedly told us that the Bill is based on concern for passengers. He has told us that all of the provisions about fair competition, shared cars, and so on, arise from that. Here, at last—leaving aside deathbeds and grandfathers—he has the perfect opportunity to demonstrate, now and when the Bill becomes law, that his concern is specific and that he is prepared to back it up. It will then be made clear beyond doubt, given that a percentage has been specified, that in considering revocation of a licence, no commissioner has any option but to consider the past record of people found to have unfit vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will come up with some concrete arguments and will accept the amendment. I am sure that his hon. Friends would support him. It is a pity that we cannot persuade Conservative members to speak. Perhaps self-raising flour would help. Plenty of Labour Members rise, but the quiet is on the Government side when we are discussing vital issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentlemen were doing that. The amendment may indeed relate to a vital issue. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever I am on my feet, Mr. English, I try to confine myself to important issues.
If the Minister is about to rise, I should be most interested to listen to his case for not including the provision. His reasons why the amendment should not be accepted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a simple point to my hon. Friend? It seems to flow from the amendment that he is discussing. Is it not the case that he is not resting his argument solely on the figure of 5 per cent., but rather trying to advance the thesis that there must be some point at which the number of unfit vehicles in a fleet must affect the issue? Has he indicated clearly to the Minister that, even if the figure of 5 per cent. is rejected, he would like an answer on the principle? If 50, 60, 70, 80
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
or even 99 per cent. of the vehicles in a fleet were unfit, surely that would affect the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that intervention. I was about to go on to deal with the point, but he was refreshing my memory in case I had forgotten it. I assure him, however, that I had not forgotten it and was about to go on to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister rises to answer the debate, as undoubtedly he will, he must tell us two things. The first is why the amendment is not valid. That is a crucial point. But he must also tell us where the Government stand on the principle. Whether the figure specified is 5, 10 or 3 per cent., or whatever, the principle is still valid. When we say that we are concerned about unfit vehicles, do we really mean what we say? Will the Minister respond to our point of view and tell us where he stands on the question of unfit vehicles?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that he will accept the amendment. If he were now to say that he would accept the amendment, I am sure that the entire Committee would rise in acclaim. At last he would have grasped the point that we have been making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, when the Minister rises, will he do as I ask? First, will he give a concise, lucid argument why the amendment should not be carried? Secondly, if he will not accept the amendment, will he tell not only the Committee but all those who avidly read the 	<i>Official Report</i> of its proceedings every night before they go to bed in order to find out what the Transport Committee 'is doing—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] They may very well read it in bed. I would not be averse to their doing so. But will the Minister tell them exactly where he stands on the question of unfit vehicles? What measures is he prepared to take in order to provide a sufficient deterrent? How does he intend to prevent unfit vehicles from plying the roads of this country and to ensure that cowboy operators will be governed by the provisions of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) have seized upon a valid point. They are extremely concerned that there should be adequate powers to take away a licence when the holder of that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1195</span>
licence is putting unfit vehicles on the roads. The amendment is clearly worded and appears to give the traffic commissioners an additional power to revoke, suspend or curtail a licence in the circumstances that have been described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in agreement on the principle. It is certainly essential that if an operator puts any unfit vehicles on the road, that should be a ground for revoking his licence. He is jeopardising public safety. In fact, as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, anticipated, I shall seek to persuade the Committee that the point troubling both he and his hon. Friend is already covered by the wording of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(	<i>c</i>), which comes in the middle of a list of grounds upon which the traffic commissioners may revoke, suspend or curtail a licence, refers to a prohibition under clause 17. Hon. Members will recall debating that clause a week or so ago. It says that when a
	<br><blockquote><p>"vehicle is, or is likely to become, unfit for service,"</p></blockquote>
it may be prohibited. Paragraph (c) deals with unfit vehicles in a slightly more obscure way through the agency of prohibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that if one vehicle owned by an operator has been made subject to a prohibition, or if the holder of a licence has been convicted of an offence under subsection 9—that is, using a vehicle whilst under prohibition—he may lose his licence. So paragraph (	<i>c</i>) is far more stringent than the amendment proposed. There is no question of 5 per cent. or anything of that kind. If one vehicle has been the subject of a prohibition the traffic commissioner "may" revoke the licence. That sounds extremely severe, but I emphasise the word "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reach that part of the clause, we will be dealing with the wide discretionary powers of the traffic commissioners the grounds on which they "may" if they think fit, revoke or suspend. That is a drastic penalty, and could put the whole bus fleet out of service if they use it, so one has to rely upon the traffic commissioner using their powers sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that discretion is allowed would enable the traffic commissioners, or the courts to take account of the point made this morning by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) about a small
	<span class='label label-info column'>1196</span>
rural operator who has one vehicle, discovers it at some stage to be defective, and is taken off the road. There would be no downrating of the gravity of his operating an unfit vehicle or of his chance of being sentenced to a prohibition. But the traffic commissioners will, of course, be entitled to use their common sense and judgment. They can have regard for the public interest, in deciding whether to use their powers, and, if so, which of the wide range of powers open to them under subsection (3) is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to make those controls effective for the reasons of public safety that lie behind the operator licensing system, we have to provide these wide powers and then, of course, enable the traffic commissioners to use them with the appropriate severity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to anticipate the judgment of the traffic commissioners and the Committee should not seek to do so either. Traffic commissionrs have expertise in the business that for which they are appointed, more so than anybody in the Committee, and are responsible men who can be relied upon to put the public interest and safety first. If any operator allowed his fleet to get into such a state that 5 per cent. of his fleet had been unfiit within the previous six months—imagine a fleet of 50 buses with three found to be unfit for service—such a stage of public danger would be reached that the operator would be asked to have his licence revoked. But the powers would be there. If matters reached the level contemplated in the amendment adequate powers would already exist in the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is no difference of purpose between us or in the priority that we give to public safety and the importance of having fit vehicles, and responsible operators putting fit vehicles on the road. The wording of the Bill adequately covers the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always listen to the Parliamentary Secretary carefully, because I find him a reasonable man. On the point at issue in the amendment I sincerely believe him to be wrong. I took the trouble to read clause 17 and the argument which he put during the break between sittings, and I shall answer his point in one moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, first, Mr. English that I incurred your wrath several times this morning by straying off the point. I did
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1197</span>
so through ignorance and was not being wilful. I shall endeavour to do better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of this afternoon's sitting, the Parliamentary Secretary strode sharply into the Committee looking as fresh as a daisy, and the Minister came in carrying two enormous red boxes. I was totally overawed, so they have taken unfair advantage of me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is rather more than a probing amendment because an important principle is involved. The EEC regulation which covers the background to this and other amendments lays down that one cannot lose one's professional competence except in one respect—namely, if one has a transport manager who moves away or dies. However, these are other tests of professional competence. One of them is covered by the words of the amendment. I genuinely think that they are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The track record of anybody holding an operator's licence may be found wanting within a six-month period, when his whole record is examined with regard to the fitness of the vehicles, but it may outside the prohibitions that the Parliamentary Secretary has been arguing about. Therefore, the principle of our amendment should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to add another ground in subsection (4) on which the traffic commissioners can take the various actions described in subsection (3), specifically in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) of that subsection. Under that subsection the traffic commissioners can revoke, suspend, vary or curtail the period of validity of the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing that a sixth paragraph must be added to subsection (4). An operator's track record—how he has kept his vehicles and in what state of fitness should be examined and should be one of the grounds to be considered when taking the course of action outlined by the clause.
The basic argument behind the amendment is that it shows a lack of professional competence as an operator if over a six-month period some percentage—whatever it may he—of his vehicles has been unfit. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary within the terms of the amendment. This is the burden of the Parliamentary Secretary's case against the amendment, about which I hope he will think again. I agree with him that revocation of the licence in subsection (1) is not a matter to be taken lightly, because if the operator loses his licence he
	<span class='label label-info column'>1198</span>
will lose his livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in the part of the country where I live, if the operator loses his licence we lose the service. That is very serious in rural areas. If one assumes that an operator employs 20 men it will also mean unemployment. I am not unmindful of the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Party seems to have a love-hate relationship with traffic commissioners. I have heard it said many times that these people live in a bureaucrat's paradise but under the terms of the clause the Minister gives them enormous discretionary power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the narrow focus of the amendment, it seeks to insert four lines. I think that the charge that I levelled against my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and Holborn and St Pancras, South (Mr Dobson) about flexibility still stands. The amendment is too inflexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one is talking about 5 per cent. of vehicles, one might be talking about something which is almost impossible to define. I took the point of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) that a small rural operator, trying to judge what a percentage of his vehicles is, will be in considerable difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I pointed out in connection with another amendment that hon. Members are not allowed to argue against their own amendments. If the hon. Gentleman is supporting the amendment he cannot argue against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. The amendment says "5 per cent. or such percentage as the Minister may determine".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely my hon. Friend appears to be pointing out some of the difficulties of arriving at 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. The amendment is addressed to other than 5 per cent., and that includes any percentage up to 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but the hon. Gentleman appeared to be criticising the amendment that he was supporting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I need your guidance, Mr. English. The amendment is in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and Holborn and St Pancras, South. This is not my amendment and I have had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1199</span>
nothing to do with it. My hon. Friends have put it forward independently. Looking at the amendment critically, I have reservations about what they have to say. That is the point I am making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Mr. English. The reservation I have is that it lacks flexibility. When one comes to put that amendment into operation it will cause problems for the small rural operator trying to judge what 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of his vehicle fleet may be. It is a sum which one simply cannot work out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that although there is this inflexibility, the amendment contains the germ of a valid principle. Here let me answer the Parliamentary Secretary's point directly. He put it to the Committee that the point in this amendment was covered by subsection (4)(	<i>c</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a prohibition under section 17 has been imposed with respect to a vehicle owned by the holder of the licence, or that the holder of the licence has been convicted of an offence under subsection (9) of that section".</p></blockquote>
I agree with the Minister that part of clause 17 is directly concerned with the fitness of the vehicle. I am not arguing that point. When a vehicle has been declared unfit and prohibited, its fitness, as I understand it, can be restored by the operator. Often, if the defect is serious, the operator may be disposed to put it right straight away. I agree that clause 17 is relevant inasmuch as it refers to clause 22(4)(	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering, the total record of prohibitions and whether the defects have been put right over a six-month period. Prohibition is a serious matter, and it relates to the fitness of the vehicle. Let us assume that in a six-month period there have been seven or eight prohibitions and the operator, being a diligent man, has put all the defects right. Eight prohibitions represent eight major defects of fitness. Within the framework of the operator's business, that is not good enough. It is a practical expression of the lack of competence of the operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that every time there is a prohibition, the operator would be liable to lose his licence. Clearly, the track record will probably be the most material consideration in deciding the appropriate sanctions. For the first
	<span class='label label-info column'>1200</span>
prohibition, the traffic commissioner probably would not bother about the licence at all. For the second one, there may be a warning and he may even consider suspending the licence and so on. The track record will be a relevant consideration for the traffic commissioner before deciding whether to use his powers under clause 22(4)(	<i>c</i>). All that is amply covered by what we have before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite agree with that. I shall take the Paliamentary Secretary at his word and assume that case is covered. I have no reason for assuming that lie is trying to obscure the issue. However, that is a convoluted way of going about it. If he accepted the amendment, the Bill would be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to labour the point further, because I have said what I wanted to say. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has put forward an argument which is not quite accurate. I ask him to look at it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's intervention has made subsection (4)(	<i>c</i>) clearer to me. The amendment is concerned with safety. It says that if, on inspection, 5 per cent. of vehicles were found to be unfit within six months, that would allow the revoking or suspension of a licence. Subsections (3) and (4) give the grounds for action. Subsection (3) states the sanction that will follow a breach of any of the conditions. This is a specific amendment about safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that all one has to do under this subsection is to prove that a breach occurred. To use the example in subsection (4)(	<i>a</i>), to have made a false statement, knowingly or unknowingly, is an offence. The commissioner has discretion to take that into account when he comes to assess the granting of an operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, we rely on clause 17(9) to determine the number of prohibitions on one particular vehicle that is found to be unfit. The reference to subsection (9) by the Parliamentary Secretary was presumably limited, as subsection (9) is, to cases where an unfit vehicle is used after a prohibition has been put on the vehicle by the certifying officer. The Parliamentary Secretary could have said that it would also be an offence in itself to use an unfit vehicle if the prohibition was made because the brakes were not adequate. That would be another offence under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1201</span>
road traffic regulations—I do not know which piece of legislation, but there are inevitably areas of consideration for matters of safety concerning the use of these vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a further point which has not been made so far in this debate. I do not intend to stray too far on it, as you have expressed a view, Mr. English, about the percentage argument. The amendment allows some latitude. If the amendment were adopted it would be possible to be quite specific—that is, to state 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. or whatever it is—rather than to allow discretion by the traffic commissioner to decide on the basis of the number of prohibitions made over a period when the licence is applied for. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me whether that is correct. I assume that an operator's licence is given for a period of five years—it does not have to be renewed until after a five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, therefore, the only time that the assessment is made by the commissioner is when the operator makes a reapplication for a licence. Under one or other regulations there may be an opportunity for the commissioner actively to intervene, if he feels that there have been far too may prohibitions within a period shorter than five years. He may then remove the operator's licence. I think that the Minister is indicating his agreement to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another matter which may reflect my lack of knowledge of the Bill. Where the period is less than five years, how is the prohibition mentioned to the traffic commissioner? We know that the certifying officer himself will know about it and make a prohibition on that vehicle. In giving statements on the application for a licence at the end of five years, the operator may have to say how many times the vehicle has been prohibited in that period—it may be five times or 10 times. But if it happened within a six-month period, about which my hon. Friend is concerned in his amendment, and in that period there were X amount of offences, which in the traffic commissioner's judgment formed reasonable grounds for withdrawing the operator's licence, how would the traffic commissioner be aware of that information? There may be a clause here that says that the certifying officer must inform the traffic commissioner on the number of occasions that may happen, so
	<span class='label label-info column'>1202</span>
that the assessment can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not appear in the Bill as far as I am aware, but I believe, in practice that the duties of traffic commissioner and certifying officer, as public servants in the same field, make for ready contact between them, and the traffic commissioners discover from the certifying officer when prohibitions have been made. When convictions occur for using vehicles in breach of a prohibition, there is a duty on the operator to inform the traffic commissioners that he has had such a conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister may want to take further advice on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On further advice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to have it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, it is. I appreciate the difficulty from my years in opposition. There is a distinct unfairness between the mass advice available to the Government and the lack of advice available to the Opposition. But that is life.
It is particularly fortunate to have further advice on this occasion, because what I said a moment ago is totally wrong. Clause 25(6) makes clear that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner imposes or removes a prohibition … he shall forthwith give notice of that fact to the traffic commissioners who granted the PSV operator's licence".</p></blockquote>
So a certifying officer has to notify, and where there is a conviction—I was right on that—the operator has to notify the commissioners if he has had a conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a more consistent and satisfactory position. The traffic commissioner will therefore have notification of the offence, presumably within the time limits specified later in the Bill. The only difference between my hon. Friend's amendment and the judgment of the traffic commissioner is the matter of reasonable judgment. My hon. Friend has been specific, though we can see difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave aside the argument on percentages. The Minister says that he is satisfied that once the offences occur the traffic commissioner will be notified and the operator's licence can be withdrawn. All that can be done within six months.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1203</span>
The Minister put a reasonable argument against that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be difficulty in assessing those buses considered unfit for service. We are talking about the prohibition on a bus being vised for public service for which an operator's disc has been granted. That disc is its legitimate right to be used as a public service vehicle. The number of discs given is determined by the maximum number of vehicles to be used, but the identity of the vehicle is not included on the disc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no argument between us that inspections should take place as often as possible, because they are a deterrent. If the inspection takes place en route it is clear that the vehicle is being used for passengers. However, it is possible that it would not be in use for hire and reward because it could be travelling as a unfit vehicle, and there would be no adverse consequences in relation to the licence or the disc. If an inspector calls at an operating centre where there are, say, 10 buses and he wants to inspect them all, it is possible that two might be found to be unfit. The operator could say, however, "These licences do not apply to those two unfit vehicles." There is no identification of disc with vehicle. Therefore, whether the vehicle was being used for public service or not, if the operator claimed that he did not use that bus in those circumstances, there would be no breach of the licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording of the part of the clause on which I rely is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a prohibition … has been imposed with respect to a vehicle owned by the holder of the licence".</p></blockquote>
Therefore it is sufficient that the holder of the operator's licence is the owner of a vehicle which has been made subject to a prohibition, and he would have no argument of the sort that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward, related to his licence during that time. It is his bus and it is bad news for him as the holder of the operator's licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just so, though only, of course, if it were a public service vehicle, because clause 17 provides that only public service vehicles are liable to be prohibited. Any public service vehicle of any sort that

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a point to my hon. Friend? May I suggest to him that it does not depend upon whether it is a public service vehicle or not. In every case, we are talking about those which are valid public service vehicles, as I understand it. His point rests on whether there is any way of tying the prohibition notice to the operator's disc on the vehicle. Presumably the prohibition notice must state the registration number or the engine number and frame number of the vehicle in order that the vehicle can be identified as the one under the prohibition notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point is valid because having that information does not necessarily enable one to identify the vehicle by the disc if the disc is covered by—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not understand what the disc has to do with it. I think that we should stick to the amendment and we shall come to these other, matters later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, Mr. English. One of our later amendments deals with identifying the licences. We accept for this argument that any vehicles that are being used as public service vehicles and happen to be at an operating centre at any time, are liable to inspection. Any found to be in default of the requirements for inspection will be valid candidates for consideration for prohibition, if the operator owns them, and, at the same time, consideration for action to follow under subsection (3).

The other arguments on to which I was beginning to stray concern later amendments. They are relevant to the argument, but not at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Much as I should like to agree with the hon. Gentleman on certain aspects of his answers, I am unable to do so. It would have done much for his credibility if he had seen fit to substitute the word "shall" for "may" in a previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary bases the whole of his argument on clause 17 as it stands. That is what we are discussing. We are not debating the clause as the Opposition would have liked it to be—that would have been altogether different. If our views had been accepted, the amendment would not have been necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we have less than specific proposals in the Bill, it is necessary to firm it up. The Parliamentary Secretary's reasons for rejecting the amendment do not stand up. The hon.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 22 in all its unamended complexity is intended, as we understand it, to be a contribution to quality control by the maintenance of operating standards. It deals with the qualtiy control that can be obtained through the maintenance of operating standards by the vesting of crucial powers in the traffic commissioners. It is not necessary to outline those powers for the purposes of the points that I need to make on clause stand part.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1206</span>
	<p>unfit or is likely to become unfit the public service vehicle examiner or certifying officer may prohibit the driving of that vehicle. But in clause 22—I believe that the hon. Gentleman used the argument of subsection (3) (	<i>c</i>)—we find that the traffic commissioner may or may not take action. Our aim is to give a clear and specific definition to the traffic commissioner of the exact circumstances under which he should act. The Parliamentary Secretary relied on previous clauses for his argument, but under clause 17 (9) it is necessary for a conviction to have taken place before that provision is valid to the amendment.</p>
	<p>I do not believe—and those outside the House will agree with me—that the Parliamentary Secretary has given a credible answer to the amendment. If he believes that the interests of the public must be served—and he has stated his belief in that on many occasions—he should realise that those interests would be served and seen to be served if the amendment were accepted.</p>

	<p>a public sitting if the commissioning with the powers under the clause proposes to revoke his licence, suspend it, curtail the period of its validity or vary its conditions. I want to ask the Minister about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see why it would be advisable to have a public sitting. It is a matter of public interest in many cases whether there should be revocation of a licence. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said, revocation of a licence might mean withdrawal of a service from an area and those who might be affected by such a withdrawal would certainly have an interest. I welcome the idea of their being able to attend a public sitting considering an appeal, presumably by an operator against revocation of his licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is to be so, is that right to demand a public sitting seen by the Minister and the Under-Secretary as a right that is addi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1207</span>
tional to the appeal procedure under clause 27? I take it that the appeal—to the Minister is still open to the operator even if at a public sitting the commissioner rejects his appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also take it that one of the reasons for the special right in this case is that while the appeal to the Minister was taking place under clause 27, a considerable time could elapse during which, but for the right of public sitting, the operator could have his licence revoked, and be unable to operate. I understand the clause to mean that there cannot be revocation of a licence until a public sitting is held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the case that if, after the sitting, the commissioner is not satisfied that a sufficiently good case has been made by the operator the revocation can take place and remain in force until the Minister has considered the appeal under clause 27?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the related point about the time scale. Given the consequences of revocation and the fact that it could take up to five months for the Minister to consider the appeal, it seems that between the sitting date, which presumably can be organised quite quickly, and the Minister's consideration of the appeal, an operator could have his licence revoked and be unable to operate in conditions under which, if the appeal succeeded, he would have the legal right to operate again. The Parliamentary Secretary should therefore advise the Committee about that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question whether what we have learnt from our debate on clause 22 should lead us to the conclusion that there should be an obligation on a commissioner to consult other commissioners who have issued road service licences to an operator before determining whether to revoke a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind the operation of a long-route—it would have to be a long stage carriage route for this purpose—through the area of more than one commissioner. In that case, under the provisions of clause 22, the commissioner considering revocation would be the one in whose area the operating centre of the operator was located. But a decision on whether, for example, there should be revocation, because the manager of the transport undertaking had left and the company had ceased to qualify as competent to operate, should be subject to the judgment of all those in a position to issue road service licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Near his base, in the operating area,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1208</span>
where there was also a road service licence, the operator may be able to perform the service reasonably well without his manager. But further up the line, in other areas, the traffic commissioners may take a different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other areas, the traffic commissioners may feel that when granting a road service licence the benefit of the doubt should be given to an operator because many miles away, in another traffic commissioner's area, there was an efficient manager in the operating centre who would oversee the operation. But as the Bill stands that other commissioner would not even be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider whether to insert a provision that would require the traffic commissioner, considering the use of his important powers of revocation, to consult other traffic commissioners who have issued road service licences to an operator whose services run from one traffic commissioner's area to another. That could have a serious bearing on whether a just decision was taken in the difficult and delicate area where we are balancing the advantage of the operation's sound management with the difficulties of operators in special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point on the assumption that if the operator ceased to be of good repute or appropriate financial standing, the commissioners in all areas would take a common view. That would be because the public knowledge relating to the service would be similar. The public knowledge from area to area of the effectiveness of a service and how far that depended upon its being run by a competent manager from a central point, could vary, but it is clear that the traffic commissioner who would make the decision would be the one who had issued the operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a point in the clause that has puzzled me greatly. I have read it a number of times and I am still not sure what it means. It is subsection (3) and it begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to subsection (1), the traffic commissioners by whom a PSV operators' licence was granted may".</p></blockquote>
It then spells out what they may do. I should like to know the meaning of the words "without prejudice". If one gives them the widest possible interpretation and assumes that they mean that the powers under subsection (3) are not limited by subsection (1), the traffic commissioners
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1209</span>
could use those powers much more widely. They could use them in respect of operations other than those covered by standard licences. If "without prejudice" is given that wide meaning, he could use the powers to "revoke", "suspend" or "vary" the conditions of a licence of someone who was operating solely under restricted licences.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Parliamentary Secretary is nodding. Therefore, if that is the meaning of "without prejudice", I fail to see why we could not have evoked a response this morning on the question of why there is a difference of judgment or power of the commissioner in relation to the operator with the standard licence or the restricted licence in respect of subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provision of subsection (3), the effect of the commissioner's decision can be just as drastic for the operator. It can be just as drastic for the public who are dependent upon the operator running the services. There are still powers under subsection (3) to revoke the licence, to suspend it, to curtail the period of validity and to vary the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that rests between the use of the powers under subsection (3) and the use of the powers under subsections (1) or (2) are the grounds on which the action may be taken, which are outlined in subsection (4). There, the grounds are extremely wide. It appears that the only possible logical basis for making the distinction between the powers exercised by the commissioner under subsection (3) and those exercised by the commissioners under subsection (1) would be if the grounds under which the commissioner could act under subsection (1) were appreciably wider than the grounds outlined in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether, with his legal training, it is his reading of the clause that subsection (4) places considerable restrictions on the commissioner in the use of his powers under subsection (3), restrictions which do not apply to the use of powers under subsections (1) and (2). If the Parliamentary Secretary can confirm that that is so, would he give us some examples? Would he show us, either by a legal definition, an example, or a description in plain English, the scope of those areas in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1210</span>
the commissioner could operate under the provisions of subsections (1) and (2), and the grounds for action which are open to the commissioner under the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) which are not open to him under subsection (3)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to balance the judgment—that is, whether what should apply for standard licence holders under subsections (1) and (2) should be under a much wider ground for action than that for standard or restricted licence holders under subsection (3), which appears to be equally sweeping, or whether that should be subject to much more limited conditions. Presumably, part of subsections (3) and (4) combined overtake subsections (1) and (2) because subsection (3) must apply to the standard as well as to the restricted licence holder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need some explanation why, when the clause was constructed, it was considered appropriate to have the sweeping powers under subsection (3) applying to the restricted licence holder but the sweeping powers under subsection (1) not applying to the restricted licence holder. I presume there is some logical reason for drafting the Bill in this manner but at this point it eludes me completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gilroy Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the remarks made by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), I should like to ask my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary the interpretation of the hidden portion in clause 1 that has not been discussed and how that will interpolate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed good repute, which is one of the three criteria, and is in accordance with the attributes of military good order and discipline. We have discussed professional competence at some length, but I would appreciate further definition—although this might be hidden in the mists of Transport Act history—of "appropriate financial standing". What is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who are disturbed by the ever-widening powers of the commissioners could find many different interpretations. Is "appropriate financial standing" the standing of a man who is a millionaire on paper but has nothing in his current account, or the standing of a man who has vast cash sums and few buses? Is it a man who is virtually broke to the knowledge of the world, but whose wealth is carefully camouflaged? Or, as the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1211</span>
this morning, is it the three-bus operator with one bus off the road? How can this be translated? What does it mean? When would an operator's financial standing no longer be appropriate? Can the phrase be defined in the positive, even by further regulation and, if not, when does it not apply in the negative. The phrase is so open to interpretation that it is essential to know how it will interact with this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is an essential corollary to earlier clauses which require applicants to satisfy the commissioners on a number of points—specifically in respect of their good repute, financial standing, maintenance facilities, and so on—before a licence is granted. The clause empowers the commissioners to revoke or suspend licences if they cease to be satisfied on those qualifications. Without such a power the operator's licensing system would be without teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this clause the traffic commissioners can take disciplinary action against operator licence-holders who fail in any way to meet the standard required. The threat of losing a licence is often as potent a sanction as any court proceedings. It may often be enough for the commissioners to call the operator to a public sitting and draw attention to his failings and to the consequences if they continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grounds on which commissioners can take action are spelt out. The list is comprehensive and ensures that commissioners are empowered to act whenever necessary. At the same time it is important that licence-holders should not feel that they can be unfairly treated—hence the provision enabling them to request a public sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That takes me to the first point raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). I shall now depart from my copious notes and deal with the question of public sittings—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And give a very quick off the cuff answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Public sittings, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, are a protection to the holder of the operator's licence. Following the principle that justice should normally be done in a public sitting, it is right that the accused should have the protection of a public sitting if he so requests. It should not be possible for an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1212</span>
operator to be deprived of his licence, and hence his livelihood, behind closed doors with no access for the press or the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This does not mean that only the operator can decide whether there should be a public sitting. The traffic commissioners have a general right to hold public sittings on any matter within their powers which seems to them to be important. They have that right under section 153 (1) of the 1960 Act. If a major operator is faced with the possibility of revocation or suspension of his ipperator's licence it is possible that the traffic commissioners would hold a public sitting, and there would be widespread public interest if the operator was a well known major operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position, then, is that the traffic commissioners may hold a public sitting if they think fit, but the operator can demand a public sitting even if the traffic commissioners had decided not to hold one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no effect on the right of appeal to the Minister because the traffic commissioners' decision will have been made at either a public or private sitting. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the finding against him he has the right of appeal to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads to the right hon. Gentleman's second query on what happens between the time the traffic commissioners' decide to revoke—it is true that several months may go by—and the Minister finally exercising his powers. That is dealt with in clause 27(4) which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Traffic commissioners making any such decision … may, if the holder of the licence so requests, direct that their decision shall not have effect until the expiration of the period within which an appeal against it may be made to the Minister".</p></blockquote>
That is the equivalent of bail pending appeal if a man were being convicted before a criminal court. But the penalty is suspended until the final recourse of the applicant, which is an appeal to the Minister, has been exhausted. If the Minister turns down the appeal, revocation, suspension, whatever it may be, will come into effect immediately he has given his decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify something for me? I have tried to read quickly the subsection to which he has referred. I thought clause 27 (4) was at the discretion of the Minister. Am I wrong, or does the Minister have a discretion to allow the suspension until he hears the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1213</span>
appeal? I thought that under that subsection also the Minister would have to give a quick decision in the event of the commissioner refusing to suspend the revocation. There is a time limit as well, I believe. That I understood to be the effect of the subsection to which he referred, therefore he did not answer my direct question about whether there could be a considerable period during which a licence was revoked until the Minister made his final decision on the appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suspected, the right hon. Gentleman knew the answer to his own question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The traffic commissioners give a decision, a revocation; the licence-holder appeals to the Minister and applies to the commissioners to suspend the revocation until the Minister has heard the appeal. The traffic commissioners will decide whether to do that. In a blatant case they may think it is time wasting and the sooner these people are off the road the better, heaven knows who may be killed during the next six months, and they turn it down. There is then a right to apply to the Minister for a decision within 14 days on whether the revocation should take immediate effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore possible that 14 days could elapse when an operator's licence was revoked before the Minister lifted it again in a case in which the Minister decided in favour of the applicant on appeal. That presumably is the problem worrying the right hon. Gentleman. There is that small danger, as we have illustrated, but the Bill is riddled with safeguards to try to ensure that the applicant has a right to a public hearing to make sure the revocation does not take effect until the final ministerial decision is forthcoming. Immediate effect, even when an applicant seriously intended to appeal to the Minister, would be imposed only in a very serious case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman requested an explanation of the difference between subsections (1) and (2) and subsections (3) and (4) of clause 22. The distinction is perfectly clear. Subsections (1) and (2) deal with the mandatory requirements where the traffic commissioners have to revoke a licence once they have made the finding of fact that the holder of the licence is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>1214</span>
longer of good repute or financial standing, or no longer has anybody with a certificate of professional competence. In the case of a standard licence holder, once the traffic commissioners have found that he has ceased to satisfy one of the three requirements, the wording of subsection (1) is "shall revoke the licence". There is no discretion once they have made that finding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) is much wider, with wider discretion. That is why it is written in looser language, and, as we were arguing before, subsection (4), the grounds under which this discretionary power can be exercised, are wide and allow the traffic commissioner to weigh up the gravity of the offence. Subsection (3) gives a wide discretion which the traffic commissioners may exercise if they think the circumstances justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) and (4) apply both to standard licences and to restricted licences. Restricted licences are not covered by subsection (1) because the Government have decided, due to the nature of restricted licences, the kind of operators that use them, by subsection (1). The Government have decided, because of the way we are trying to exempt them from the rigours of the EEC directive, as the EEC directive entitles us to do, that it is right that the commissioners should have a discretion in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the commissioners will not hesitate to take off the road holders of restricted licences who have committed a grave breach of requirements. Nevertheless, every case of restricted licence is discretionary. The discretion is there, too, for standard licences, but the main criteria for a standard licence is good repute, financial standing and professional competence. Once the commissioners find that those requirements are not met, subsection (1) comes into force and a mandatory revocation applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the queries of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) about "appropriate financial standing", a striking phrase, capable of a wide variety of meaning. That phrase is defined in schedule 3. It is to that schedule that one has to turn for all the criteria for an operator's licence. There was no question about that provision; it raced through the Committee in lightning time, so satisfactorily was it regarded and so clearly explained by my right hon. Friend who, at that point, was in charge of the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1215</span>
Hon. Gentlemen overlooked the fact, despite the care with which they perused the Bill, that paragraph 2 of schedule 3 contains a definition of "appropriate financial standing". In addition, it explains the reason for the inclusion of the phrase. An operator must have
	<br><blockquote><p>"available sufficient financial resources to ensure the establishment and proper administration of the business carried on, or proposed to be carried on, under the licence".</p></blockquote>
There is no public interest whether the man is a millionaire or a pauper. Public interest arises in that an operator must be someone of sufficient financial standing to afford the proper maintenance of his vehicles, to guarantee putting them on the road every morning, paying wages, buying the fuel—providing a service. He must not be a gambler trying to set himself up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The equivalent of that test exists in the present provisions for public service vehicles, and it is right that we retain it. For that reason the traffic commissioners have to be notified of bankruptcy because a financial collapse means that the holder of the operator's licence is no longer in a position to carry out or finance the necessary work to maintain the service and the safety of his vehicles. That is one of the yardsticks applied by the Bill to an operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is an essential part of the operator's licence system. It gives the penalties that can be imposed and the means by which a licence can be revoked or withdrawn if the basic criteria for operators' licensing are not satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has overlooked the question that I put to him—whether the commissioner who is dealing with revocation has to consult other commissioners who have issued road service licences to the operator in respect of his operatiosn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had overlooked that point. In practice, the traffic commissioners are not a numerous body of men; they are a tightly-knit body of 11 traffic commissioners who cover the entire country, all of them specialists in their field. In practice they would consult quite often. I do not see how the situation could arise that was troubling the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as professional competence is concerned, the requirement is that the transport manager of the business should
	<span class='label label-info column'>1216</span>
be somebody who holds the necessary certificate under schedule 3—the transport manager of the road service side of the business. It is not possible for the certificate holder to be tucked away in one traffic commissioner's area, unknown to the traffic commissioner in the next. The traffic commissioner who is issuing the operator's licence needs to know that there is a man somewhere who is the transport manager of the whole undertaking and who holds a certificate of professional competence for that operator. Therefore it is not a question of not knowing enough about it. The operator has to produce the man who is the holder of the licence, if his licence is being challenged. I do not think that there is any question of needing to consult on that sort of matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make the point clear. I fully appreciate that all those who issue road service licences will be aware that they are issuing them to a company or person who has a competent manager. I was concerned about what happens at the point when a decision has to be taken, within the discretion of one commissioner, whether the service should be allowed to run for a period without the competent manager. What I am suggesting is that the view that might be taken by one commissioner in the light of his experience of the operations in his area might be different from that of a commissioner in another area served by the same operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only decision that has to be taken when the transport manager ceases to work for the operator is that the operator has to be allowed a reasonable time to get a new one. That cannot be affected by whether some other chap is about. The wording of the subsection is
	<br><blockquote><p>"for such period as seems to them reasonably required".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman may be saying—I am trying to think what he is envisaging—that it might be reasonable to give a longer period to somebody who has a perfectly satisfactory foreman, who can run the business right away but who, for some reason, does not want to stick with it. That could be put forward by an operator, I have no doubt. If he were pressed and he required more time than was usual to find a new transport manager, presumably the operator would produce the chap with some commendations about him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1217</span>
If any question arose about the man who is to be the acting transport manager being better known to the traffic commissioner of another area, it is the sort of matter where consultation could easily be devised between the traffic commissioners. No doubt if one traffic commissioner were invited to consult one of his colleagues, he would do so. I do not think that it is necessary to make a statutory requirement. It would be tedious and unnecessary in many cases to lumber them with the obligation to consult, although the traffic commissioners dealing with an operator's licence always have enough information to deal with the application themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I should like to do in the short speech that I shall make on clause stand part is to try to bring out a number of general matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have consulted private bus operators in my area about the Bill. They are private people who have been in business for a long time. I put the clause before two of them—I am glad to tell the Committee that neither of them had a stroke on reading it —andthey were very sceptical about its general effectiveness and impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of general problems arise on the clause. First, I doubt whether it is a good idea to give such wide discretionary powers to traffic commissioners. The powers are not elastic. If there are to be these centres of power, in the end there could be abuse and the traffic commissioners are responsible to nobody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have a conspiracy theory of the world. I have never believed that there are people working behind the scenes for my downfall or that of the nation. But certain parts of the clause give enormous powers to the traffic commissioners. I agree that there are areas where there must be discretion, one gives power. I suppose that the purpose of the clause is to strike a balance between tying the traffic commissioners down with too much bureaucratic regulation, and giving them the discretion to make a judgment about practical matters in which they have to make ad hoc decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seeks to strike such a balance, but I do not think that it succeeds. It gives too much power to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. Paul Dean 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1218</span>
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Gilroy) said about one of the discretionary areas—financial standing. The Parliamentary Secretary referred us to schedule 3, but I do not think that it provides a satisfactory answer. A business may be set up, with equipment and so forth, but the crucial question is whether it has the capital resources to last through a bad patch. What judgment is to be made about the long-term financial stability of the operator? I agree with the hon. Member for Yardley that that is a difficult question. It would certainly require an accountant, and possibly a crystal ball, because one can never forecast the business climate. The hon. Gentleman's point was therefore a very fair one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this new form of operator licensing is to be set up for passenger transport matters, there must be an adequate disciplinary framework, and adequate and appropriate penal sanctions if rules or regulations are broken. I know that the Committee will agree that if there is to be a change in licensing it is essetial for the transport community to have a system which is in no way inferior to the old one. Let me put the question directly to the Committee. Are we likely to get a better system out of this than the one we had before? My answer to that is an emphatic "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes the change to operator licensing. This morning I telephoned two operators. I asked Suffolk county council, which is not of my own political persuasion, but it is a very responsible body of people especially on transport matters, what it thought about operator licensing in other respects. The reply given to me by people with a great deal of experience in the transport world was that many of them regarded operator licensing as a completely slipshod system which in practice has very often not worked so well as the old system. Many people who are not of my political persuasion, and who disagree with me on transport matters, have expressed a lack of confidence in the change being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that lack of confidence is justified and a system emerges which is not so good as the old one, the disciplinary powers will have to be very good indeed, and seriously I wonder whether they will be. I have no means of judging whether the information that I put before the Committee is true or false. I report it to the Committee in good faith for what it is worth.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1219</span>
I am still not clear as to what are the precise differences in the respective revocation powers on standard and restricted licences or, indeed, what is the justification for having a dual standard. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will outline for the benfit of the Opposition precisely what are the major areas of difference with regard to disciplinary powers between standard and restricted licences. That is still not clear to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is absolutely no difference, except that standard licences are subject to subsection (1). The commissioners have no discretion. If they find that the holder has failed to continue to satisfy any one of the three basic requirements, the licence has to be revoked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that clarification. I find the clause curious. When L sat behind the then Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers), during the passage of the Transport Act 1978, there was constant criticism from the Conservatives about the extent of the powers of the traffic commissioners. Among the arguments that were put forward was one that could have been readily anticipated. It was that traffic commissioners restricted competition. Yet this Bill no less than the 1978 Bill Act allows that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already pointed out that the commissioners have enormous powers— quite staggering in fact. Oposition Members have already pointed out that the commissioners have the power to put people out of business, to create unemployment and to destroy a passenger service. Are the checks and balances in the clause sufficient to iron out the dangers in those powers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to an argument that has been used in discussions on other issues. I have heard the Parliamentary Secretary speak of precedents elsewhere. I am not a lawyer, and arguments about precedent do not impress me at all. One of the great dangers of the British system of government is that if one tells any Englishman—though not a Welshman—that something has a precedent, that allows one to get away with any villainy at all. That is a dangerous line of argument, and one that I would reject absolutely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioners have a great
	<span class='label label-info column'>1220</span>
deal of power, and therefore a great deal of responsibility. We have an obligation to ensure that the clause expresses the powers of the commissioners unambiguously. One of the fundamental failings of the argument for discretion is that it is impossible to be unambiguous and also to give discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a small body of men, of whom the Minister used the word "govern". I do not know whether that was a Freudian slip; that will be revealed in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> I shall look at that very carefully. The commissioners do indeed govern. They are potentates of a sort. I speak from the Labour side of the Committee. It may be thought that the Labour Party has a greater leaning towards bureaucracy than do other political parties.—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I thought that that would elicit a response from the Government side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to consider whether we may have gone too far in this matter. It is fair and logical that if a traffic commissioner has given a licence he can take it away. He who giveth, taketh away. That is all very well. But I am not sure whether the safeguards in the other parts of the clause are substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the operator have the absolute and unqualified right for a public hearing if he is hauled over the coals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that answer. I now know where I am going. I have never attended a hearing where the demand has been that the operator's licence should be revoked. I know that it is done under the 1968 Act and that it stems from a power given in the 1960 legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what sort of hearings they are. I have inquired at second hand and am told that the mumbo-jumbo which is spoken is incredible. I also understand, and I expected it, that those inquiries are now cluttered up with lawyers. As we all know, the more that lawyers are employed, the further one gets from the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is to be a complicated case, and someone is accused of doing something which could lose his livelihood and his operator's licence, of course it is a serious matter and he should argue the case. But I urge the Minister to try to use his influence to see that in inquiries and sittings of that kind proceedings are kept reasonably informal, so that the ordinary operator can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1221</span>
go along to put his case without wig and gown, so to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know more about the liaison arrangements between one traffic commissioner and another, and one area and another. If the operator's licence is in area 1 and an offence is committed in area 6, there must be a degree of liaison, and I suppose that there must also be a body of precedent and case law to which one can refer to try to make some sort of relative assessment of the seriousness of the offence. I should be pleased to know what liaison arrangements are expected under the clause. Will there be a regular meeting like the Council of Trent? Will they phone each other up, or will it be done by memoranda?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can receive a response from the Minister on those points, particularly the wider fears that I had at the start about powers of discretion, I for one shall be immensely relieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I should like to emphasise the importance of the standard of performance and integrity that we are trying to obtain from the transport managers. I am afraid that, with the general unwillingness of the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the restraint in time of the discretion on the commissioners which is now provided in subsection (2), I am not satisfied that this is a good clause or that it will achieve all that we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the transport manager—against whom all the restraints and regulations basically are directed—is a most important person, not only managing the business for its owners but also being responsible for carrying out the various statutory duties which the Bill will impose on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I do not believe that the Parliamentary Secretary's failure to accept two of our amendments will achieve what we desire in the way of rigour. We are not satisfied—I certainly also speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans)—with a clause that leaves it open to the traffic commissioner, either because he is not rigorous in approach, or has forgotten it or something like that—to suspend the revocation of a licence of an operator who does not have a transport manager. It could be for years on end, as the clause is drafted. We firmly believe that there ought to be a time limitation. We proposed six months and we hoped that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1222</span>
the Minister might accept it if it allowed him some discretion. Without some statutory limitation we find the clause unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of the clause that remains unsatisfactory is the failure to specify in the grounds for revocation the unsatisfactorily high incidence of vehicles owned or operated by an operator which are declare unfit for service. In those circumstances, I cannot support the motion that the clause stand part of the Bill. I live in hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues will, on reflection, decide that there is merit in our arguments and correct matters later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first have the pleasure of welcoming you back to the Committee, Mr. Dean? I hope that we can conclude this sitting speedily by some form of agreement across the Committee and not keep you in the Chair for long. As with all things, I live in hope. If the Parliamentary Secretary is listening, perhaps our hopes could join and we could have some serious discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have serious reservations about clause 22, as we have had with most of the clauses so far. There has been much change of heart by the Government since they were in opposition. The Parliamentary Secretary has repeatedly referred to the 1978 Act. I recall that during our Committee on the 1978 Bill, the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) was keen to do away with traffic commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is someone on the Government Benches who still seeks to do that. That seems strange when we consider clause 22, because, far from doing away with the Commissioners, the Government are keeping them in work. When it comes to giving them a specific remit so that they can exercise their powers the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister avoid that. If the Government wish the Bill to succeed, they must be more specific in many respects.
I refer to a speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary in 1979 which was reported in the British Transport Authority's "Transport in Britain" columns.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1223</span>
This is germane to the clause. The hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We want to encourage more, responsible operators".</p></blockquote>
The credibility of that statement would indeed have been valid if he had accepted some of the constructive amendments from the Opposition. If the Parliamentary Secretary insists that he wishes to encourage more, responsible operators he should have accepted some of the constructive points that we tried to put in the clause, because they would at least give credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same speech the Parliamentary Secrerary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" allowing operators the maximum freedom to provide attractive services wherever they believe they can do this successfully."</p></blockquote>
One cannot quarrel with that. But in giving freedom he also has to give responsibility, which he is not giving, because so many things in the clause are completely unspecified and left open to doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same lengthy speech—I would not dream of reading it all to the Committee, although I have read it with extreme interest—he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" In case anyone has doubts, none of this will mean any relaxation in the standards of safety we expect from coach operators and we will continue to do everything possible to maintain these."</p></blockquote>
This is the key remark:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only responsible people will be permitted to operate coaches and the inspection of vehicles for public service will be kept at a high standard."</p></blockquote>
He then gives a little aside:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may be interested to know that we are now preparing improvements in braking standards."</p></blockquote>
The latter part, of dealing with braking standards, does not relate to the clause. Remarks to the effect that only responsible people will be permitted to operate coaches and that the inspection of vehicles for public service will be kept at a high standard would have more credibility if the Parliamentary Secretary had been specific in the powers given to the traffic commissioners, so that their remit to work on those points would be valid.

	<p>time again he has given completely unsatisfactory answers to our amendments.</p>
	<p>On the percentage amendment, it was left open to allow the Minister to make a regulation.

The amendments are perhaps somewhat conflicting in the sense that we are attempting to amend something that is actually being taken out. I apologise to the Committee that in drafting the amendments, we did not see the inconsistency in that approach, but I hope to make clear that the argument is about making sure that these discs which it will be a duty on the operator to display on the vehicle will be a means of showing the legal right to operate a particular vehicle on which they have to be exhibited. As I understand it, discs have to be displayed on all public service vehicles that are involved in stage, express or contract operations used for hire and reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Government intend that a lot of the matters as to what information shall be displayed on a disc can be dealt with by regulations, and that all the Bill seeks to do is to make clear that it will be the recognition of such a disc and the duty to display it, and that certain information shall be displayed on the disc. To operate a vehicle under these conditions without a disc on display will be a contravention of the obligations and will lead to the various sanctions laid down in other clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 23 (1) makes clear that the vehicle itself
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be used on a road as a stage, express or contract carriage".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1226</span>
unless an operator's disc is fixed and exhibited on the vehicle. Our amendment No. 218 proposes to delete sub-paragraph (	<i>a</i>) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"contains particulars of the operator of the vehicle and of the PSV operator's licence under which the vehicle is being used".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 219 seeks to delete subparagraph (	<i>b</i>) which brings us to part of the argument that deals with leaving it somewhat permissive—that is, it
	<br><blockquote><p>"either relates to that vehicle or does not relate to any particular vehicle".</p></blockquote>
Our amendment No. 206 proposes that the disc itself should be identified by the vehicle registration number with the vehicle on which the disc is to be exhibited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that if we carry amendment No. 218 we should remove some important parts of the right to put particulars on a disc, perhaps even a registration number. There is some inconsistency in our amendments, but the point is to discover what the Minister has had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle is not new. We have seen it working with the road haulage industry. The Foster report has examined the operability and effectiveness of displaying discs on goods vehicles. We therefore have a certain amount of experience to guide us on whether discs are effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment states that the vehicle registration number and other particulars should be on the disc. However, since we have been asked to give possible alternatives I repeat that we believe more in the road licensing system. That gave control to the traffic commissioners. One of the fundamental changes being brought about by the Government concerns the operator being given the identity disc for display on the vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come later to the matter of how many discs are to be given. It is not important to my argument at the moment, except in relation to putting the vehicle registration number on the disc. Clearly, that is a more specific way of dealing with the problem. The vehicle of which the registration number is shown on the disc is the only one which can be used as a public service vehicle in the manner described in clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for us to know what information the Minister intends to have put on the disc. The crux of our argument is that we wish to identify a particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1227</span>
vehicle by a disc. In the road haulage industry, the disc presumably has to relate to the vehicle on which it is. However, I am not sure whether the vehicle registration number has to be shown. With public service vehicles it should be. Presumably the regulations that the Minister makes will state what information must be put on the disc, but it will not necessarily be specific to the vehicle. We think that that is open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the disc does not show the registration number the operator may be tempted to use more vehicles than he is licensed to operate. If he is is licensed to operate 50 vehicles it will be possible, with the flexibility of the clause, for him to operate 55, 60 or 65 vehicles. The only requirement—perhaps the Minister can advise us whether I am correct in assuming that, if 50 discs are given to an operator to operate 50 vehicles, he could technically run a fleet of 75 vehicles. He could be hiring another 25. It is not a limitation on the number of buses that he may use in his fleet. It is solely a limit on the number of buses that he may operate at any one time, which seems reasonable. For example, if a bus is damaged, why should the operator be put into the difficult position of carrying out his obligations to use 10 buses on a particular run? He would find himself in difficulties if he were confined to a vehicle of a particular registration on the disc for which the licence was agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance of the argument rests on whether the advantage of maintaining a disc and operating a licence system is still achieved by putting the registration number on the disc. Amendment No. 219 proposes to take out subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>)
	<br><blockquote><p>"either relates to that vehicle or does not relate to any particular vehicle".</p></blockquote>
I do not see why the Minister feels that that provision should be included. If flexibility is to be allowed, it is not required. It could be left to the discretion of the traffic commissioner to lay down a specific condition or to decide that, in certain cases, it may relate to the vehicle. Or is this an argument that the Minister himself is allowed the discretion? When he considers the regulations, has he an open mind on whether the vehicle registration number should be put on the disc? Is that really the meaning of clause 23(1) (	<i>b</i>), which we seek to delete?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks for advice, one is bound to seek it only from the industry itself. The only people who have been using the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1228</span>
system of operator's licences, in this country at least, are those in the road haulage industry. One may look to the hauliers to see what their experience has been. We can only rely on opinions of present-day bus operators on the use of operating licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are in some difficulty over the speed with which the Committee is proceeding, about which I have heard complaints. Like it or not, we have gone through 10 or 11 amendments so far at this one sitting. While that may present difficulties for members of the Committee, it also presents difficulties for the industry, which has found it very difficult to give advice at sufficient speed on different amendments relating to a very complex Bill. We are grateful for the advice that we receive, but it has been beset with difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only today we received a brief from operators giving their views about an operating licence requirement. It is clear from that brief on amendment No. 206 in regard to putting the vehicle registration number on the disc that they feel that it would allow a certain flexibility to the industry. They gave the example of a damaged bus. The amendment would ensure that they were not put into a difficulty over their obligations to carry out a public passenger transport system. One can understand that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a certain amount of flexibility could be introduced to meet that difficulty, perhaps by means of a discretion on the part of the traffic commissioners. However, as the Minister has said, if the purpose of the Bill is to reduce the amount of bureaucracy, it is desirable to reduce the number of checks and controls by the traffic commissioner to make it easier to reduce the classification and criteria he has to take into account in assessing whether a bus service will be provided in a different area. As we found with other amendments, to argue the case against that is to argue against the philosophy of the Bill. The Government have made clear their intention, so I shall not dwell on that. There is a difference between us on how to regulate and control bus services and our disagreement remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I presume that the Minister hopes that in no way will the use of operator licences and the provision of discs undermine the quality of buses, service and safety in the industry. Therefore, if the argument is that by putting a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1229</span>
number on a disc improves safety, clearly the Minister will consider that, if he thinks that it may prevent opportunities for illegal operators or cowboys to exploit the possibilities and potential of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen operator licensing under the previous Labour Government. Earlier, in 1968 or 1969, we saw the introduction of the licensing principle. That has operated for a number of years and, therefore, it is relevant to consider what the Department asked in the review of operator licensing. In November 1978, concerned at the number of complaints occurring in the road haulage industry, for a number of reasons, it set up an inquiry under Professor Christopher Foster into the road haulage operators licensing system. That is the same principle as we are now agreeing to implement for the passenger transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report was produced in 1978. I have no intention of going further than is relevant into the broader areas with which that report was concerned. A section of that report deals specifically with the problem of discs to be displayed on lorries. I believe that the Committee will wish to consider whether we might adjust this legislation to ensure that the difficulties arising in road haulage licensing operations do not occur in the passenger transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I further believe that the Committee will agree that the matter of a bus capable of carrying 50 people or more will give us more concern on grounds of safety than a lorry that may be heavier but carries only one or two persons. Both matters involve our concern for safety, but public transport, whether by air, road or rail, is obviously much more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is relevant to look at what Professor Foster had to say about the operation of the system of discs, particularly in regard to illegal operations. In the Bill there are references to standard licences, restricted licences and all sorts of discretion. The Opposition fear that having all these discretions available will make it possible for many more cowboys to come into the industry. One reason why operators' licences were introduced was to check the cowboys, so the argument could be advanced, that the disc system could be used to meet the same criteria, to make sure that the cowboys do not operate in the bus industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the bus industry is a con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1230</span>
siderably different animal. It is far more regulated and controlled than the road haulage industry as it was before 1968. That part of Professor Foster's report dealing with the discs reveals that it was felt that an opportunity would be provided to check illegal operations by requiring vehicles to carry a visible licence plate in a conspicuous place. We recommend that this should be done as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My knowledge will not be as great as the Minister's, but presumably when he forms his regulations and this disc has to be displayed he will tell us not what he may do or what his recommendations are for lorries—that is another area for consideration—but whether that problem will present itself with the buses. A disc will plainly be evident for all to see in accordance with the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the present licensing system requires such a licence, together with the vehicle registration number, to be plainly evident on the windscreen of the bus. That recommendation by Foster, which was a recommendation under the operating licence for discs for the road haulage industry, is not necessarily being fully implemented. Indeed, Foster says that this recommendation,—as is evident in our amendments—has constantly been made by all the committees examining licensing, including Salter and Geddes, and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the proposition has received support from the traffic area enforcement staff and the police".</p></blockquote>
In many ways, everybody seems to be supporting this principle. It seems to be the case that it has not necessarily been observed, and the requirement is that the Minister will take that into account when he comes to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One powerful argument made by Foster is that the changes he recommends in this area which deal with discs
	<br><blockquote><p>"should make it far easier to detect illegal vehicles. If…they are backed up by a computer record system immediately accessible to policemen and vehicle and traffic examiners in order to check quickly on a particular vehicle, it will become much harder for individual vehicles or whole fleets to operate illegally through falsification or forgery of plates"—</p></blockquote>
or in the use of the discs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a matter of considerable concern, which the study set up by the Department under the previous Administration has shown. I hope that the Minister will reply to those fears, taking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1231</span>
into account the criticisms that were made, admittedly not to the bus and road transport industry, but to the road haulage industry. If he is not prpeared to do as we suggest, namely, that it should be written into the Bill, will he make it clear that such discs should carry the vehicle registration number on the disc and be visibly displayed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 220 we are in to another argument. I shall not deploy the argument between "may" and "shall". It is an area of discretion and judgment. While flexibility and discretion are always allowed by Governments, nevertheless it is a matter of judgment, often made more stridently by those in Opposition. I am sure that when the Minister was in opposition he argued the case against the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 220 proposes to delete "may include". Clause 23 (2) says that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"disc in the prescribed form issued … by the traffic commissioners by whom the licence was granted and containing the prescribed particulars, which shall include particulars of the holder and of the licence and may include particulars of the vehicle to which the disc relates."</p></blockquote>
It is another argument of discretion. One could find many arguments for and against. It is better to hear what the Minister has to say about why, having put so much information into regulations, he includes in those lines the words "may include".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest taking out those words and leaving
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include particulars of the holder and of the licence and particulars of the vehicle to which the disc relates".</p></blockquote>
That reflects amendment No. 206, which we have tabled to subsection 1 (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 215 is concerned with the sanctions that will apply if the obligations are not observed by the operator who has been granted a licence and who will be displaying a disc. Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a vehicle is used in contravention of subsection (1)"—</p></blockquote>
that is, not showing a disc with the particulars of the operator and his licence—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operator of the vehicle shall be liable on summary convinction to a fine not exceeding £200."</p></blockquote>
We have argued about whether that sum should be more than £200. I have no intention of deploying that argument again. The amendment seeks to add as subsection (5A):
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a vehicle is used by the same operation in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1232</span>
contravention of subsection (1) on two occasions the traffic commissioner shall require the operator to return the disc."</p></blockquote>
The Bill does provide for the revocation of a licence where conditions have been contravened, but we suggest that if an operator has deliberately contravened the conditions at least twice, he should be required to return the disc. As on the previous amendment, I am sure that the Minister will say that it must be within the judgment of the traffic commissioners. We do not suggest two or three contraventions. We do not say that 5 per cent. of the vehicles should be unsafe. But because the traffic commissioners will be notified of contraventions, they will be able to make a judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While our amendments may attempt to tie the traffic commissioners down more securely than does the Bill, we have no reason to disagree with their judgment. That has been questioned in Committee on a number of occasions, but I think that they do a pretty good job in difficult circumstances, which are becoming increasingly difficult. Nevertheless, we are changing the system, and we must envisage the traffic commissioners working in the context of the Bill, and not of previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing how often a vehicle may be used and under what circumstances. An operator has suggested to me that if the vehicle licence disc is not identified with a particular licence, the operator who does not want to observe the provisions of the Bill, or who wants to blame someone else when the conditions are not complied with, may try to operate more buses than the traffic commissioner thought necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, of course, covered the matter of blame in subsection (6), which states that for
	<br><blockquote><p>"an offence under subsection (5) it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence".</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable provision, but we consider it to be a loose control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of discs that an operator may have is determined by all manner of things—competence, maintenance facilities and so on. If he operates more buses than that number, quite clearly he will be beyond the capacity that the traffic commissioner considered right when he awarded the number of discs under the operator's licence. It is our central theme and fear that the use of discs, coupled with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1233</span>
operator's licences, as a means of control will make it easy for a number of fly-by-night operators to operate beyond the capacity considered suitable by the traffic commissioner. We believe that our series of amendments, particularly the one that identifies the vehicle with the disc, provides an important method of maintaining control under what we believe to be a looser arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee for me to intervene at this stage. I noted what the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) said, particularly his concern about enforcement and the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective behind requiring operators' discs to be displayed on all vehicles being used for hire and reward is to provide a means of identifying licensed vehicles. In other words, it is for enforcement purposes. The argument is that requiring each disc to show the vehicle registration number may add a further pair of braces to help hold up the enforcement effort. That argument was put to us in consultations with the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this licensing system is rather different from the licensing system in which discs are used for a heavy goods vehicle, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, or, indeed, for the ubiquitous motor tax. It is aimed not at individual vehicles but at operators and their suitability for running and maintaining a number of vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore examined the need for discs in this licensing system. If they can be dispensed with without weakening enforcement—if there are other, simpler ways of identifying licensed vehicles—I believe that there will be general agreement that there would be a considerable saving of work for the operators and, of course, for the traffic commissioner's staff. Clearly, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, our aim is to cut out unnecessary restrictions and regulations and unnecessary bureaucracy. 1 should have thought that that desire, too, was fairly common on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I consulted the traffic commissioners again. The burden of their advice was that this clause, which involves the duty to exhibit operator's discs, is unnecessary. We already have powers under the construction and use regluations for painting names and putting licence numbers on the vehicle itself. In other
	<span class='label label-info column'>1234</span>
words, we already have the power to do what we believe is necessary in the interests of enforcement. Therefore, in responding at this stage to the hon. Gentleman's amendments—which, at least in some aspects, would go in the opposite direction to our proposals—it is right for me to advise the Committee that at a later stage the Government will seek to withdraw the clause altogether and ask the Committee to negative it. In those circumstances I would not wish to accept the amendments proposed by the hon. Gentlemen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, since it sounded like a very important statement, presumably the Minister was indicating that he would take the whole clause out of the Bill. If that is to be done at a later stage, as inevitably it will be—presumably on Report—the Minister is saying that there will be an operator's licence but there will no longer be a requirement for the vehicle to carry a certification on a disc giving this information, which is what we are seeking to achieve. One would want to give some thought to that statement. Certainly we shall have a chance on Report. But basically that would be flying completely in the opposite direction to Professor Foster's concern about the safety of the disc system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct in the way that he has understood the matter. He is not right and correct in his analogy with Foster, because Foster was dealing with heavy goods vehicles and not with this operator licensing system. The crucial point about the clause, which will lead the hon. Gentleman down a curious path if he chooses to take it—is that the whole burden of the hon. Gentleman's remarks was that discs would make it easier for the traffic commissioners is that if we are to take the burden of the traffic commissioners' evidence that they have no need of this system and that existing regulations will be sufficient, it is difficult to construct a case for saying that the duty to exhibit operators' discs should be continued in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition go down that road, they will have to say that here is something which the Government are seeking to take out of the Bill which would make life simplier for traffic commissioners and simpler for the operators. We apologise that it is in the Bill to that extent, but it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1235</span>
inevitable, because advice on this matter has changed. With the best will in the world, there is little point, unless the Opposition want to continue down this rather curious path, in having a great deal of discussion on the individual amendments to a clause which we shall be advising—not on Report but during our Committee proceedings—should be negative. When it comes to the stand part debate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is an important point. No one disagrees that it is important, but I thought that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I indicated what we intended to do at this stage, because clearly it alters what hon. Gentle-mans might wish to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for making it clear to us that his intentions runs counter to the intention of all out amendments. By and large, they seek to tighten the requirement to have the disc and to include within it particulars of the vehicle. The Minister, on the other hand, says that he will go to the opposite extreme and, presumably on Report, put down an amendment that will take away the disc requirement altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made that clear in my point to the hon. Member for Kingston-upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). When we come to debate whether the clause should stand part of the Bill I shall advise the Committee to negative that proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for making that clear. It puts us on a slightly different time scale or, if I might put it this way, a short fuse. We shall not have the time that I had thought we would have between now and Report to consider the implications of his words. Those implications are considerable. He is saying that he will treat the vehicles that carry people 	<i>en masse</i> in this country in a way that he would not dream of treating a motorist's vehicle or a vehicle that was carrying goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the point at which I start. If it is necessary to be able to identify, for the purpose of regulation and enforcement of our law, a vehicle which carried straw about the country, it is certainly more
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
important to require vehicles that carry people to have this identification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman takes off, may I point out that it is our intention under the present construction and use regulations to ensure that the operator of the vehicle has his name and licence number on the side. I know that the right hon. Gentleman understands that we are talking about operator licensing here. It is simply a simpler system. The name and the licence number of the operator will be there and he will still be subject to operator licensing, so I am at a loss to know what the fuss is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister does not understand what the fuss is about. There are two arguments which govern the way we proceed. First, how does one get hold of the particulars by an examination of the vehicle? Is it on a disc displayed in the window or are the particulars to be affixed to the vehicle in some other way, whether painted, punched in small holes on the side of the vehicle or engraved on a plate? Secondly, what particulars are discernible by an examination of the vehicle, and how do we determine in this legislation what those particulars are?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I suggest that the Committee faces an even greater difficulty in knowing that the Government's intention is to negative the clause at the end of the stand part debate before they examine whether another new clause, which might deal with how particulars are to be affixed to the vehicle in some other way, is appropriate. I must pursue the point with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman—whatever other point he pursues—would be wrong to pursue a point on the new clause, because the powers already exist under construction and use regulations. There is no question of a new clause being introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall argue that there is justification for a clause. I do not need to deny the Minister's proposition that powers exist under construction and use regulations in order to develop my case. First, we want a stronger disc provision-that is clear from our amendment. Secondly, we want better control, within the primary legislation, of the particulars displayed on the vehicle. I hope that I have made that crystal clear to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
In the light of the information about the Minister's intention on clause stand part I intend to pursue those two serious aspects. We are clear about the Government's intention. On clause stand part the Government will recommend to the Committee that the clause be negatived, thereby deleting it from the Bill. I shall argue that a disc system is necessary, that it should be strengthened, and that the particulars to be required on the vehicle, whether on the disc or on the vehicle in some other way, should be subject to better control within our primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not argue with the Minister that there are not powers under the construction and use regulations to have particulars of vehicles; I know that to be the case and I know the difficulties that arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we do not want the clause, and—as far as we know—no one else wants the clause, on whose behalf is the right hon. Gentleman putting forward the need for the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not particularly perceptive tonight. I thought that he would have observed that the Opposition want the clause, not in its present form, but in a strengthened form. In so far as the Minister tells us that the traffic commissioners will be on his side, at least in getting rid of the clause, he has my profound congratulations. I am delighted that at last he has found one group of people in the country who agree with one of the Bill's basic propositions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the Minister to say that he had consulted the traffic commissioners about the vehicle registration number, for which they had expressed a preference. I may be wrong, but I thought that that was what he said. If the commissioners had, as I thought, asked for a registration number, I understood that they said at the second consultation that they did not want the clause. Having a piece of paper with a registration number on it as opposed to not having it would make a difference. A registration number is much more effective, and I thought that the judgment had been changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wide open to an intervention by the Minister at any time. But I understood him to say that he consulted the traffic commissioners and that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
he and they agreed that there should not be within legislation a duty to exhibit an operator's disc upon the vehicles covered by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had consultations, and the burden of them is exactly as the right hon. Gentleman states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I argue first the methods by which we indicate in our primary legislation that the particulars on a disc are inadequate. I believe that a disc that was adequately controlled by our primary legislation would be of particular value in enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable that whilst clause 21 (1) {	<i>a</i>) provides that a certain group of vehicles should have a disc containing particulars of the operators, and of the public service operator's licence under which a vehicle is being used, nowhere in the Bill can one find those particulars, because, as with so many other provisions in the Bill, they will be covered by regulations. This is a simple and straightforward matter. Surely the Minister, with the resources of his Department behind him can make a decision about the particulars, he wants on vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is such a simple and straightforward matter, and as we are presumably about to adjourn for dinner, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will consult his hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) so that he does not have to be interrupted by him in order to present a simple case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not being interrupted by my hon. Friend on the presentation of a simple case. I was being interrupted after a most remarkable statement by the Minister, informing the Committee that, after having come this far, to clause 23 and after publication of a consultative document, we are being recommended to vote against the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple and elementary point that I wish to make is that it should be possible for the Minister, with the resources of the Ministry of Transport at his command, to decide what kind of particulars h weants displayed on a vehicle. This argument is relevant to whether they are to be painted on, put in gilt lettering or stamped on the inside of the mudguard. This is crucial. It would be simple either to write into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
clause what particulars are required, or put them into a schedule, if that would make things even simpler.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That should be done. It is not good enough to say simply that this is a matter for regulations, particularly when the regulations, as I understand the Bill, are not subject to any control by the House. If difficulties of enforcement arose—as they might well do—from a failure by the Minister, in prescribing the regulations, to ensure that it was possible for those with duties of enforcement to gain information by examination of the vehicle, hon. Members would have no redress. If the Minister wants to leave the matter to regulations, the least that he can do is to examine what sort of regulations might be used.

One of the problems that I have with the clause concerns subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>). The issue is raised in amendment No. 219. That subsection refers to a disc which
	<br><blockquote><p>"either relates to that vehicle or does not relate to any particular vehicle".</p></blockquote>
That seems to me to be like throwing a coin in the air and putting on a bet that it will come down heads or tails. Surely either a disc relates to a vehicle or it does not. It is as if one were to say "That woman is my wife or she is not my wife". One could be sure of making a sound statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot for the life of me see the virtue in constructing the clause in this way. The least that we might have expected of the Minister in relation to subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>) is that he should distinguish between those vehicles that will have one category of information marked on them and those with another. That would be reasonably simple, given that we have now determined the categories of vehicle that are to be covered by the PSV operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of including the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"may include particulars of the vehicle to which the disc relates"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (2) is to throw into utter confusion anybody seriously studying the issue of where the discretion lies. So far as I can see, that phrase gives no indication of who will use the discretion. For all I know—or the way that I would guess if I did not understand how the Government work their legislation—whether the information was put on would be left to the person who wrote out the disc. That is what the clause seems to say, and I try to read the language
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
with a common-sense approach. The wording is vague, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the matter of the penalty. That issue is crucial to the argument about how far particulars on vehicles will be necessary to enforce the legislation. I assume the Minister will agree that, even if he were to recommend that we remove the clause altogether, there would have to be exception of a penalty for not marking a vehicle in a way that enables it to be identified for some enforcement purpose. That is an important issue which should be seriously considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has rejected the idea of stressing the importance by changing the fine that someone would have to pay on summary conviction for not complying with the law covering the disc. Presumably the Government would take the same view about other means of furnishing particulars on vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some virtue in doing what the Lord High Executioner wanted in "The Mikado" and making the punishment fit the crime. If the right to run a vehicle within legislation passed by the House depends on its having some form of identification to assist the enforcement of conditions that are important for public safety—Conservative Members do not seem particularly worried about the relationship between identification and public safety, but the Opposition take the matter extremely seriously—we suggest that when an operator is convicted on a number of occasions for an offence in that respect, the means of running the vehicle should be taken away from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the great advantages of discs. It would be difficult to find some other means of showing the details that relate to the issuing of an operator's licence, which could be affixed somewhere else on the vehicle, and taken off when it was decided that the vehicle should not run. The disc has a traditional place in our road traffic law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to see whether a vehicle has a disc. A policeman walking down the road can cast his eye over a vehicle and although he may not see exactly the numbers on the registration plate, or the little brass plate attached to the chassis, and certainly will not see the number stamped on the engine block, he will see whether there is a disc on the windscreen of the vehicle. The disc has considerable merit when dealing with enforcement, but the Minister recommends that we take from the Bill the duty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
to exhibit an operator's disc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An operator's disc is of considerable importance it enables any policeman or examining officer from the Ministry to check on a number of important points relating to enforcement. There are weaknesses in the disc system described in the Bill. I will not dwell on the weaknesses described by my. hon Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East, but they are important. That is why the Opposition want to tighten up the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are totally opposed to the idea of doing away with the disc and we cannot see how one can justify having a disc requirement on the private citizen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is road tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are trying to educate me on why we have tax discs. Surely tax discs are a method of enforcement. One can see by looking at a vehicle whether a tax disc is out of date, and from that one can assume that the owner has not paid his tax. That is a straightforward enforcement procedure. We are asking for a similarly straightforward enforcement procedure in relation to public service vehicle operators. PSV operators are not all angels, as we have realised from our debates. They try to evade the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Failing to pay one's road tax is a serious enough offence to warrant a simple system of checking enforcement. It is an equally serious offence to run a public service vehicle without having the correct operator's cover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a great guffaw of laughter from the Government Benches when my right hon. Friend made the valid point on tax discs. Considerable expense is incurred having discs printed in different colours so that it is easier to identify whether they are out of date. Many tax evaders have been caught because of that. We go to that expense so that it is easier for policemen to see whether a disc is out of date without having to read it. Perhaps if we were talking about strengthening the system, instead of weakening it or doing away with it altogether, it would be easier to impose the penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. Our amendments are directed towards that strengthening and it would be in keeping with their spirit and intention
	<span class='label label-info column'>1242</span>
if we sought to improve identification. I know that there are limits. We would not want the disc to be 6 ft in diameter and would not specify that it should be covered in glow paint or have a reflective surface that can be spotted at night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disc system has served us well in identifying certain forms of licensing requirements whether of tax payments or operations. But, now, when the operators' licence is becoming much more important under our legislation, because of a reduction of requirements in other ways, the Government propose to take away this simple means of identification at a time when they are removing the requirement of a road service licence for express buses. There will be no check on them, such as now applies to road service licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we understand that the Government are schizophrenic in this sort of legislation. On the one hand they want to do away with controls and licensing, but on the other they want a respectable piece of legislation so that they can say "We are looking after public safety." Sometimes the Government are so schizophrenic that one day the Minister will walk into the Committee split into two by his great dilemma. I will not attempt to describe that in another way, Mr. Dean, as I believe that I may have been out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a serious issue. At this late stage in our proceedings, after months have elapsed, we can only say that we want to hear much more about the justification. Many of the arguments in support of the amendments are totally relevant. The Minister may say that the commissioners have said that they did not want discs exhibited, but did he put to the commissioners the propositions contained in the Opposition's amendments? Surely the Minister anticipated the important issues raised in our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister put this draft of the clause to the commissioners and asked, "Do you want a duty to exhibit a disc to be framed in our law, whether the disc relates to the vehicle or not?", I can understand why they replied, "We do not want that sort of disc, as we do not think that it will be helpful to us in trying to enforce the operator licensing law." Had the hon. Gentleman put to them the proposition that they might have a disc giving not only the name of the operator, but the conditions under which it was issued, whether a vehicle was to be placed under certain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1243</span>
operating restrictions and so on, which enabled it to be identified immediately, I believe that he might have received a different response from the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I return to congratulating the Minister. In examining him on the Bill we have found that operators have been against him, employers have been against him and local authorities have been against him. But now he has a small body of powerful men—whom we were told his hon. Friends did not much like, because they believed that those men had too much power to make sweeping decisions affecting the livelihoods of operators, their employees and public services—on his side in this one proposition. That is what he has managed to accomplish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not convince me and I shall be interested to hear from the Minister whether the proposition that he put to the commissioners was the one in the clause or our option of a disc-operated system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman wants to know only whether we put his amendments to the traffic commissioners, the answer is "No."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That underlines my point. I suspected that, although I granted the Minister the benefit of the doubt that he had anticipated the questions that we are raising. They are not questions which come from our own experience, but questions which arise largely from the experience of those to whom we have talked who work in this industry. Therefore they are questions which need to be answered before we proceed to the next amendment. When we deal with the next amendment we are dealing with another aspect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely this is the right hon. Gentleman's clause stand part speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. I had assumed, as my hon. Friend had, that we were now moving, in the light of my right hon. Friend's statement, to a debate on clause 23 stand part. The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has not touched on the key amendment—the insertion of a vehicle registration number—for as long as I can recall, during a speech, the beginning of which goes beyond my personal recollection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is talking about the disc.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my understanding that everything said by the right hon. Gentleman for some time has not related to any amendments but is his assertion of the value of the disc system. The disc system comes under the debate on clause 23 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can help the Committee. I have allowed a wide debate on this series of amendments and I thought that it would be for the convenience of the Committee to do so. In view of the Minister's statement early in the debate about the Government's intentions, I shall certainly not allow these arguments to be repeated on the clause stand part debate, if we eventually have one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Dean. I am not challenging your ruling, as Conservative Members will discover if they listen. I just want to know how we shall be able to debate new clause 13, which is unrelated to any of the topics that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 13 has been selected for debate, so matters relevant to it will be in order in that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I call the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), can he give me any indication of how long he is likely to take with his speech, as it is getting past the hour when it is convenient to adjourn for dinner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might take me another 10 minutes or so to sum up. It depends how long it takes me to correct the mistaken impressions of the Parliamentary Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hour, it would be convenient to adjourn for dinner now.
