<div class='page-header'><h1>TRANSPORT BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i> [<i>11 December</i>],
<br><blockquote><p>That the bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 3, Schedule 1, Clause 4 to 12, Schedule 2, Clauses 13 to 20, Schedule 3, Clauses 21 to 32, Schedule 4, Clauses 33 and 34, Schedule 5, Clause 35, New Clauses and New Schedules relating to Part I of the Bill, Clause 36 Schedule 6, Clauses 37 to 42, Schedule 7, Clauses 43 to 50, Schedule 8, Clauses 51 to 57, new Clauses, new Schedules and Schedule 9.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>[MR NORMAN FOWLER]</p>
<p>Question again proposed.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the submission I was making to the Committee on Tuesday was so rudely interrupted by the flight of time, we were dealing with difficulties that arise for the Committee from the form of the procedure motion. I crave your indulgence, Mr. English, to depart for a moment from that, to say how much we welcome you to the Chair of the Committee—I am sure I speak for all hon. Members—and the degree of pleasure at seeing you in the Chair is only equalled by the degree of our regret at the departure of Mr. Lamond, after such a short time in control of our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, soft soap will not make me rule in order things that are out of order, such as personal references to myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not for a moment suggest that you would be diverted, Mr. English, from the most impartial of judgments completely in accordance with the procedures, traditions and precedents of this House, by anything I might say. Equally, I hope there is no implication in your remarks that I might try to influence any Chairman, and certainly not yourself, to depart from lines of complete impartiality in your rulings in accordance with the procedures of the House.<br><br>
We are in a difficulty which is, I think without precedent. When we started to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
discuss this matter on Tuesday, a whole series of amendments to clause 1 was held to be out of order—a ruling we accepted. When we were guided by Mr. Lamond as to part of the reasoning behind that, we were able to make a submission to him on which he undertook to re-examine whether, on the basis of his ruling he had given, certain types of amendment should be selected and we know from the selection this morning of amendments Nos. 8 to 10 that one type of amendment is clearly in order.<br><br>
We understand that the difficulty we face in seeking to amend clause 1 arises from the relationship between that clause and subsequent clauses of part I. therefore, we suggested, this difficulty could be avoided if the Minister had put down a different form of procedure motion. If clause 1 is restrictive because it can relate only to the contents of the remaining clauses of part I, it would seem to us more reasonable and more logical to take clause 1 after the other clauses of part I when we know the views of the Committee as to what those other clauses should contain. Up to now that has not been accepted by the Minister as a proper way of proceeding. Although we have asked the Minister for his precedents for such a clause, he has said only that there are precedents. He will not tell us what they are. Therefore we have been unable to examine them to see when any Standing Committee ever met with such a difficulty previously and how the difficulty was overcome. I still contend that the difficulty must have been overcome in such cases because we can find no instance in which this House has accepted that it cannot amend a clause in Committee.<br><br>
If amendments can deal only with "the purposes" of the Bill, to use the wording of the clause, which are referred to in other parts of the Bill, then certainly a number of other clauses are not mentioned in clause 1 which definitely give purpose to the Bill. Those are mentioned in some other amendments and therefore we shall look later for your guidance, Mr. English, on this point. But it would be wrong of me to leave any member of the Committee under the impression that the only difficulty we face in debating clause 1 would relate to whether clause 1 accurately describes the purposes. We have contended justly that, not only does it fail accurately to describe them, it does not include all the purposes.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
There are other difficulties. This might be best illustrated if I refer to a difficulty which arose with the interpretation of the Employment Protection Act, 1975 which, in section 1(2), said that the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service should be
<br><blockquote><p>"charged with the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the development and, where necessary, reform of collective bargaining machinery."</p></blockquote>
I submit that that was declaring the purpose of setting up this body.<br><br>
Section 14 that Act gave the Service a clear right to determine by any means it thought fit a certain procedure. The words were,
<br><blockquote><p>"In the course of its inquiries into a recognition issue under section 12 or 13 above the Service shall ascertain the opinions of workers to whom the issue relates by any means it thinks fit,"</p></blockquote>
Those of us who debated that clause in Committee—and I was the Minister responsible—it thought that it gave a clear and unfettered right to ACAS to determine the means by which it took the opinion of workers. This has been subsequently tested in the courts and the courts have ruled that that is not the intention of the Act, that the clause cannot be read in isolation in that way. It has to be read in connection with section 1(2). Therefore there is not an unfettered right for ACAS. It must be tempered, qualified, restricted and circumscribed, in order that it will fit in with a court ruling about how it should promote the extension of collective bargaining and development of certain machinery.<br><br>
It seems to me therefore that in the absence of any indication from the Minister as to precedents, I can quote a clear precedent established in the operation of the Employment Protection Act which must lead us to believe that, if we passed clause 1 and the rest of the Bill went through unamended a case could be brought to the courts on some subsequent occasion in which it would be argued that the rights or even duties set out in subsequent clauses for bodies responsible for the administration of Bill if it becomes law—that is, in respect of the licensing of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
buses, the checking of the extent to which operators have complied with their duties, and so on—may be subject to the provisions of clause 1.<br><br>
Let me refer to one in particular, a very simple and straightforward one at first sight. Clause 1 (<i>c</i>) refers to the purpose of "making it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences and restricting the power to attach thereto conditions as to fares". It does not take a great deal of imagination to see that somebody who has been turned down by a traffic commissioner or who has difficulty in dealing with any official of any department will go along to the court. If that official should defend himself on the basis of any clause of part 1—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Much of what the right hon. Gentleman says would be in order if we were discussing clause 1, but we are not. We are discussing a procedural motion. Will the right hon. Gentleman, who in the last debate said he might move an amendment, meanwhile address himself to the main question? Will he make clear to me what exactly he is suggesting in relation to the procedure motion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My apologies for not making clear that reason for my line of argument concerns the difficulty that arises from the procedure motion. If we discussed clause 1 often all the other clauses in part 1 that difficulty would be avoided. We might then be able to table amendments indicating the Committee's view of the purpose of the Bill flowing directly from our consideration of those clauses. I therefore contend that this is a matter appropriate to the way in which we proceed. If it is your guidance Mr. English, that I can now put down an amendment which would have the effect of doing that, I will be only too glad to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should certainly like to see the text of the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, but it may possibly have escaped his attention that we have already amended this sittings motion up to "clause 36". Therefore we have passed the possibility of amending anything before that. Any amendment must relate to anything after "clause 36"—to the latter portion of the motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had appreciated that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
which was why I was addressing myself to the motion rather than to the amendment, Mr. English. What I will have to do is to persuade the Committee that we should defeat this procedure motion before I can return to my point. So I hope that it will now be in order for me to submit to the Committee that, because of the difficulty that arises from taking the procedure motion in the form as amended on Tuesday, it should be defeated. For that purpose I want to show four ways in which accepting the procedure motion as presently drafted will cause considerable difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are different interpretations of the procedure, and I am a little uncertain and seeking guidance from the Chair. I understood you to say, Mr. English, that we had reached clause 36 in the motion. On Tuesday we agreed an amendment to take the new clauses and new schedules relating to part 1 at the end of the discussion on part 1. Could we not extend that principle, by amending the procedure motion further, to the rest of the Bill? That would mean taking the new clauses and new schedules on Part II after our discussions on that part, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would seem consistent with the amendment which the Committee passed last time if we made similar amendments to deal with the other parts of the Bill, as the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has just suggested. If my reading of the Bill is accurate we could discuss the new clauses and new schedules relating to part II after schedule 7 and after the new clauses and new schedules relating to part III after schedule 8. I am happy to agree to amendments to that effect, or to move them if the Opposition wish.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>; That is a rather different issue from the one which we are now discussing. I very much welcome that information by the Parliamentary Secretary. It is nice to have here a Minister who is obviously seeking to help and co-operate with the Committee, and I hope that at the appropriate time those amendments will be moved. It is completely in line with a suggestion which came from this side of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
the Committee on Tuesday, and it is very welcome. It will make for better proceedings.<br><br>
What it will not do is to overcome the major problem that we have had with the restriction of amendments to clause 1. By way of evidence of difficulty arising from another Bill which attempted to declare a purpose in the first clause—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is not out of order, but I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we dealt with the amendments first and then came back to debate the main question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it would, Mr. English. I am not sure whether the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) is moving the amendments. Perhaps I had better move them. I beg to move as an amendment to the proposed motion, after "Schedule 7", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"new Clauses and new Schedules relating to part II of the Bill,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendments made:</i> After "Schedule 8," insert
<br><blockquote><p>"new Clauses and new Schedules relating to part III of the Bill".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>After "Clauses 51 to 57," insert
<br><blockquote><p>"remaining".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>After "new Clauses," insert
<br><blockquote><p>"remaining".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>—[<i>Mr. Kenneth Clarke.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the intervention by the Parliamentary Secretary which has enabled us to take four quick, unanimous decisions. I would not embarrass him in any way, I hope, by suggesting that his presence as opposed to that of the Minister has contributed to our progress. He is acting as a very able representative of his Minister, as well as applying his own considerable experience and talents in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0040">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
these matters to the work of the Committee.<br><br>
As you have reminded the Committee, Mr. English, I am barred by our own rules of procedure from moving an amendment to achieve any fundamental purpose, and so my only course is to ask for a rejection of the motion.<br><br>
I make it absolutely clear that if the Committee accepts this it will be my intention and, I hope, that of my hon. Friends who will naturally indicate their views—unlike some hon. Gentlemen opposite who seem to have been reluctant to do so up to now—to proceed immediately with that amendment and with no other, to determine the way in which the Committee should proceed.<br><br>
It is my contention that clause 1, if taken at the beginning under the restriction by which it would be debated, could have an effect which would not be the Committee's wish. If it were passed, it would be possible in a subsequent court action for an official who carried out his duties in the control of the issue of vehicle operators' licences, to be challenged and told that he had not done so in a way that made it easier for the applicant to obtain his road licence. That could open up a whole area of litigation which could be totally contrary to the purposes of the Act.<br><br>
The other difficulty that would flow is that there is by no means unanimity on either side of the House as to what the "purposes" should be. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) made it clear on Second Reading that he believed one of the purposes of the Bill should be to prevent cross-subsidisation of bus services. That is a serious intention, I accept, something which I hope would be completely within the scope of the Bill, but which finds no expression in clause 1. If it is not possible—and as there is no amendment down I presume that it has proved impossible for the hon. Gentleman to put forward this indication of purpose—there is a restriction in the suggested method of proceeding which prevents our even defining "purposes" as viewed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
It seems to me that if any purpose which is already defined in the Bill cannot be added to clause 1, there is a special difficulty. I understand, however, that amendment No. 10 has been selected and that certain types of purposes can be put into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
the Bill and certain types cannot.<br><br>
That brings me to a matter which I understand one of my hon. Friends wishes to develop. My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) is concerned that clause 1 appears to be selective as between which purposes should be declared and which should not be declared. This relates to the way in which the courts will deal with the Bill's provisions if in certain cases they are given no guidance in clause 1 on the purpose, while being given guidance on other provisions.<br><br>
Before proceeding to a debate on the subject, it is important that we should understand how precedents may enable the Bill to be dealt with in a way which would prevent certain cases being declared, and how part of the judgment on which cases should or should not be declared, should be left solely with those who draft our Bills.<br><br>
The next issue which concerns us is about the judgment of purpose, since clause 1 must include a decision by the Committee as to the purposes of parts of the Bill. I submit that there can be a difference of view on certain of the purposes. This came up clearly on Second Reading when I sought to define what I still believe the purpose of the Bill to be in respect of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure it will also come out clearly in the debate on clause 1 when we reach it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it may well be brought out then but it will be brought out at a time when, if my view were accepted by the majority of the Committee, that could not be reflected in an amendment. In fact the Committee would have to proceed either by rejecting the clause <i>en bloc</i> or by accepting that the purpose is—to take one example—to redefine and reclassify public service vehicles. There is not only a difference of opinion. There is a clear difference as to what we require of the Bill. It is the Opposition's contention that it should not be the purpose of this Bill to reclassify all public service vehicles. We have tabled an amendment which makes that crystal clear. We want a certain type of vehicle exempted from the Bill. We have no way, as of now, of indicating that to the Committee in an amendment. It is a unique situation. I do not accuse the Government of going into a conspiratorial arrangement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
to bring about such a restriction of the Committee; it may well have occurred by accident. I cannot believe that it is the intention of the Minister in a British Government Department so to instruct parliamentary draftsmen as to put this massive barrier in the way of the traditional role of a Standing Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Committee, which one would have liked to have been straightforward in terms of arguing about transport matters, has got off to the most confusing start. I hope it will not get worse. While we are arguing about this procedural motion I think we should take firm steps to put things right, so that we can get on with arguing about transport matters, and not have an interminable wrangle about what we do first and what we do next.<br><br>
However, this is not solely a matter of procedure because there are issues of principle involved. Although I would not accuse the Department of Transport of sleight of hand, it seems to me that clause 1, and the way it has been wrapped up in this legislation, is more trouble than it is worth. It seeks, as I understand it, to outline the purposes of part I of the Bill.<br><br>
Let us look at the explanatory memorandum for guidance. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 sets out the purposes"</p></blockquote>
the definite article is used, Mr. English, "the". It sets out the purposes, not some of the purposes, not the major purposes, not the majority of the purposes, but "the" purposes. However, when one examines clause 1 one finds that it does nothing of the sort. It is quite selective in its operation. Let me go on to read the rest of that explanatory sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"for which Part I is put forward and lists the major repeals which result."</p></blockquote>
Now that is a matter of dispute as well, because I do not agree that it lists the major repeals entirely. So the plain fact is that clause 1 is misleading, and if we allow this procedural motion to go through as it is, we will compound the error at every stage. Clause 1 looks innocent, but it is nothing of the sort—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee will be aware of the ruling that we could have a wide debate on clause 1, because of the paucity of amendments that are permissible to it. But we cannot have it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
twice and if we are in effect to debate clause 1 on this motion than there will be no wide debate on clause 1 when we come to it. I leave that thought with the hon. Gentleman. I think it would probably be better if we did it in the normal course and debated clause 1 when we come to it. If we debate it now, we shall not debate it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a "Catch-22" situation.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each time I stand up here I become more confused than ever. I take the point. If we are going to have a wide-ranging debate, we do not want to go over the same ground twice.<br><br>
Clause 1 has got us into this difficulty. On Tuesday we were faced with the monstrous proposition that we could not amend the clause. Frankly, I would not have been in the Chairman's shoes at the first sitting for any money because he was in impossible difficulties. It is a major piece of cheek to come before a Committee on a major Bill with a clause which is highly selective. Our arguments concern not only what is put in, it is also what is left out, and that leads to major issues of interpretation.<br><br>
I am afraid that the Opposition will be put in a situation where many of the arguments that we could have put forward about this will be ruled out by procedures which come to us in a sudden way and to which we cannot respond as we should wish.<br><br>
The whole argument about part I is what the public interest is in terms of licensing, bus transport and related matters. We are arguing about the public interest, which goes right back to the 1930 Act on licensing and is the core of all the propositions we are debating in this connection, but there is no mention of the public interest in clause 1, no indication of whether it is to be defined in any kind of way. Therefore, it is more than selective.<br><br>
I am against this procedural motion because if we accept it every procedural step we take will compound the error. If amendments Numbers 8 and 10 are carried which I see from the list of selected amendments, then we shall be adding to the selective nature of clause 1 as we go along. If clause 1 purports to be setting out the purposes, but only some purposes,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
and then, through the process of amendments we add other purposes then we are being selective at every step of the way, which is a direct contradiction to what the explanatory note tells us about clause 1. The sooner we put these difficulties right the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a newcomer to Standing Committees, I think I may need your guidance on these matters, Mr. English. In particular, I should like to remain in order throughout the whole of my speech and, indeed, throughout the rest of the proceedings of the Standing Committee. I would imagine that once we get round actually to debating matters of substance to do with the future of transport in this country, it will be a great deal easier to remain in order than it is in these extremely peculiar circumstances.<br><br>
In a sense they are not peculiar and strange to me because I find the ways of the House amazing, mystifying and calculated to produce poor legislation. That is what the House has done in the past and it seems to me that the Bill is calculated to do the same thing.<br><br>
I seek your guidance, Mr. English. As I understand it, it will be in order to conduct what might be described as a mini-Second Reading debate on clause 1, and we really ought not in that mini-Second Reading debate on clause 1 to go into too much detail over each of the subsections in it for fear of preventing ourselves debating in great detail some of the substantive clauses later in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation as I see it is that when we come to clause 1 when this motion is passed we shall first debate amendment No. 8, with which I have selected amendment No. 10, and then, unless of course some other amendment has been tabled, we would have a debate on clause stand part. I think it would be convenient for the Committee if that were a very wide-ranging debate as, apart from the one set of amendments, it would be almost the only opportunity to discuss clause 1.<br><br>
As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), if we had that debate now, it would be very difficult to permit it to be a wide-ranging debate on clause 1. While I do not mind people referring to the existence of clause 1 at this stage, I do not want its substance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
discussed now which would thereby prevent it being discussed later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I take it that you are ruling that what we can discuss now are only matters relating to the procedure, that is matters which relate to whether we should proceed to consider the Bill in accordance with the amended motion now before us or in some other way. If we want to amend that procedure motion in such a way as to take clause 1 at the end of part 1, the only way open to us is to defeat the whole of this motion and then table another. Therefore I take it that any member of the Committee who now wishes to speak must address himself to reasons why the procedure is inadequate. In doing that we shall not, I take it, provided that we keep within those reasons which affect the procedure, be held to have been discussing the merits of clause 1, and, therefore, we shall not have restricted our rights to a debate on clause stand part or on any amendments to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perfectly correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. I find your ruling most helpful, Mr. English. It seems to me therefore that, while I really ought not to address myself at all to what might be described as the content of clause 1, it would be in order to explain why its nature causes problems on our side. We had hoped that clause 1 might be either withdrawn altogether or considered last because of its peculiar nature. I shall try to avoid referring to its content.<br><br>
The nature of the clause is such that we feel that unless we can debate the content of clause 1 last and make sure that it is amended in line with the material changes in the other clauses in part 1, there is a significant danger that we shall produce legislation which will provide a field day for lawyers and a quagmire for the transport industry, including such organisations as the traffic commissioners, the operators, the pressure groups which are attempting to influence what is happening in transport in their area and may wish to seek injunctions to force people to carry out their statutory duties, and for the Minister and his officials and successors in their attempts to ensure that the law is properly carried out.<br><br>
It appears from the ruling in a number of cases recently that there is a singular
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
danger that the courts may turn to what might be described as the more descriptive parts of an Act and, reading on from those descriptive parts, may read in an intention which is not there in a specific section of an Act at a later stage. As we all know, only the House of Lords—and then only in the most desperate circumstances—is allowed to go behind the face of an Act of Parliament. No lower court can do other than interpret an Act on the face of it. I had better not give instances or you may rule me out of order, Mr. English. There is a danger that, if one of the later clauses, say, from 12 to 14, referring to trial areas, is substantially amended, since we shall already have debated and decided on clause 1, we may find that it is either wholly or partially at variance with what we have done. As an outsider, I know, and I am sure that you, Mr. English, and other hon. Members who have been here much longer and are much more experienced than I, know that it is quite possible in the legislative process for there to be some slip up, and corrections which everyone had intended should be made during the passage of a Bill are not made.<br><br>
It seems that the only way we can properly discharge our obligations, therefore, is to consider clause 1 last, or to have it wholly deleted from the Bill. Consequently, I most strongly support my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) in inviting the Committee to save itself and, what is more important, save the road transport industry a great deal of trouble. Indeed, the only benefit we are likely to provide if we proceed with the present procedure motion is to give lawyers a lot of money, and that ought not to be the object of the Committee. We have a duty to ourselves and to the public generally to ensure that we produce workable and decent legislation. I cannot believe that it would be to the advantage of anyone, least of all the Minister, to produce unworkable legislation or so to push through the present procedure motion that he finds himself in difficulties at later stages in promoting this Bill. At our meeting earlier this week the intrangigence of the Minister wasted a great deal of his own time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Gilroy Bevan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And if the Parliamentary Secretary were to rise now and say that he accepted our argument and was willing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
to come forward with a revised procedure which would allow us to debate clause 1 last, it would be as much to his benefit as to ours. Conservative Members appear to be joking about this, but I suggest that if on Tuesday the Minister had chosen to accept immediately the proposal from my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) that we meet only on Tuesdays before Christmas or that we meet on Thursday afternoons before Christmas, we would have started debating clause 1 there and then. As all our amendments have been ruled out of order, we would not have had much to debate, and had he been helpful we could well have been debating clause 2 on Tuesday. As we did not have any amendments down on clause 2, we could all have been debating clause 3 or 4 by now.<br><br>
I believe that there is some evidence this morning that the Parliamentary Secretary is more willing to see sense and to compromise on these matters. I hope therefore that he will join us in seeing that the way to expedite his business—and not only to expedite it but to make it more effective and more responsible—would be to accept the proposal of my right hon. Friend.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
There is one further point on clause 1, and I seek your guidance on this, Mr. English, because I am not sure when we can discuss this matter or seek your guidance on it. While some of the provisions in clause 1 appear to be descriptive there are others which it seems to me would change the law. That presents another reason why we should discuss clause 1 at a later stage. Subsection (2) and possibly subsections (3) and (4) substantively change the law, whereas the first part of the clause is purely descriptive of the intention of the Bill. It will be extremely difficult to go any further, even with the decision on what our procedure should be, until we have clarified whether it is accepted that subsections (2), (3) and (4) substantively change the law and are different from the earlier part of the clause. If it is accepted that those subsections would change the law by themselves without any of the subsequent clauses, we need to give a different type and quality of attention to those parts of clause 1 than the general Second Reading, or mini-Second Reading, debate which is envisaged.<br><br>
Would it help, Mr. English, if I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
explained my difficulty over this. Clause 1(1) reads
<br><blockquote><p>"accordingly the provisions mentioned in subsection (2)…shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
Then subsection (2) lists the provisions which shall cease to have effect. That seems to me a substantive change in the law and it is different in quality and time from the rest of clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman can take it that the clause does change the law, or it would change it if it were passed. If it did not change the law a clause would be unnecessary. The wording could be incorporated in a preamble, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. English, I certainly do not want to dispute with the Chair, but it seems to me that paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) in subsection (1), if passed on their own without any other clause being passed, would not change the law, whereas the remainder of the clause, if passed, would. It seems to me, therefore, that there may be some difficulty over that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather stunned, perhaps because of my lack of experience, by the ruling you have just given, Mr. English. I was under the impression, and indeed it is the whole basis of the argument, that clause 1 was not amenable—we will keep to that argument for a second—because it only indicates changes that will follow from changes in the following clauses. The argument is now that clause 1 is indicating change of law, which was the substance of our argument to begin with and our claim that we should be able to amend it, because courts would say that that was what the Bill intended. We were prepared to accept that the clause did not actually change the law.<br><br>
If you are ruling, Mr. English, that clause 1 in fact makes changes to the law, that is quite contrary to the advice that we have received. It makes the clause substantive and changes laws and, subject to your ruling, should be open to all the amendments that we have put down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's difficulty is caused by the use of a blanket term, "clause 1". I think that the hon. Gentleman's colleague actually had it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
right when he rather carefully distinguished between various parts of clause 1.<br><br>
Quite clearly, clause 1 changes the law somewhere in it and, equally clearly, not every word changes the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. English. I want to get this clear in my mind. I looked carefully, but perhaps not carefully enough, at clause 1(2). Subsection (1) says that certain things will follow, and I understand that. It is clear, that it is the intention of the Bill to give guidance. Clause 1(2) indicates the pieces of legislation that will be changed, but they are changed not by clause 1(2), as I understand it, but by following clauses. Clause 1(2) outlines only the Bill's intentions and if we passed only clause 1 we would not change legislation but only the intention to change it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is probably quite right about subsection (2), because there is a repeal schedule. But, as I said earlier, the hon. Gentleman, having addressed his arguments to say, subsections (3) and (4) would not have been able to use the same argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear. I am not trying to be difficult, but in reading the Bill and looking at how we might amend a clause that we strongly thought had to be ammended, we had to take on board the argument that it was indicating the intention of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neither my predecessor in the Chair nor I have ever said that it is impossible to have amendments to this clause. All that we have done is to rule out of order, or to be more precise, not to select certain amendments. I, very definitely, said earlier that after we had discussed amendments Nos. 8 and 10 we would not necessarily come to clause stand part if other amendments had by that time been tabled and if they were in order and had been selected. Nobody has ever suggested that it is impossible to put down an amendment that might be selected. All that we have said is that those amendments that were put down were not selected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that everybody is in a difficulty, including you, Mr. English. It is not necessarily of our own making;
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
the Bill has caused it. Amendment No. 10 was not selected on our first sitting. No amendment was selected. We are now informed that amendment No. 10 is to be selected, so clearly there is a lot of rethinking going on. We had an amendment that was not in order and now is in order, or the possiblity exists that it will be in order. That supports our point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just clear up that small point before the hon. Gentleman goes on? The amendment was always in order. It was only a question of whether it was selected or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave that matter for others to work out. For the moment may I say, Mr. English, that I do not accept it, as I do not understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. Some amendments are out of order and cannot be selected and debated. Amendment No. 10 did not fall into that category. The Chair has a discretion whether it selects or does not select amendments that are in order. Actually, all selections are made provisionally and usually discussed in Committee with the two Front Benches and with the Back Benches on both sides, and the Chair naturally tries to select amendments for the convenience of debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. I understand that and I should like to refer later to the further consideration of amendments. As you said, one of our difficulties is that we tried to obtain a joint submission with the Government on the clause and failed to get that agreement. That is one of our difficulties.<br><br>
I return to clause 1 (3) and (4). On reading subsections (3) and (4), I thought again that even subsection (4) was only outlining what the interpretations in other pieces of legislation will be if we pass the clauses after clause 1. Therefore again, subsections (3) and (4) do not change any law whatsoever. They deal solely with interpretations that will apply if the subsequent clauses are passed. If that is correct, no part of clause 1 changes any law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I continue my argument? We all welcome your interpretation, Mr. English, which was lucid, as usual, and I accept the questions raised by my hon. Friend. I do nor intend any slight
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
on you, Mr. English, or Mr. Lamond who was Chairman on Tuesday, but it is clear that even to hon. Members and members of Mr. Speaker's Panel of Chairmen, who have given a great deal of attention to the detail of legislation over the years, have been put in difficulty by the introduction of this peculiar—I accept that it is not unique—clause 1. It has thrown the Opposition into difficulties, and I believe it to be reasonable to say that it has also thrown the Government into difficulties.<br><br>
In particular, the Minister is finding it difficult to discuss the substantive part of the Bill.<br><br>
I hope therefore that not only as a result of what I say, but as a result of what the Parliamentary Secretary has heard from my Right hon. Friend and what I am sure he will hear from other of my hon. Friends, he will see fit to accept what we say. It bores my crust off to have this sort of discussion. There is nothing I like less than discussing how we shall proceed.<br><br>
We should be discussing matters of material consequence to people outside the House. The only way we can discharge our proper function as an Opposition is by scrutinising the legislation and making our political points against it, as well as trying to make sure that we finish with a workable law which those in the transport industry can implement for the benefit of the public in so far as such benefit is not already limited by the Bill.<br><br>
We have to try to get a workable piece of legislation.<br><br>
I urge the Minister, in his own interests, in our interests, in the interests of the Chairman and, above all, in the interests of getting a decent piece of legislation, to accept what we are saying and not hold to some vainglorious virility symbol of defence of this ludicrous piece of drafting. I hope that he will also convey the message to his own Department and every other Department and to parliamentary draftsmen every where that, if they want to introduce a few novelties, they should introduce them in discussion groups that they establish for themselves, rather than lousing up the procedures of the House.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Did I hear you say that there was no question of amendments having been ruled out of order; it was simply that they had not been selected by the Chair at out previous sitting?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go over the history of all the amendments at this stage. In general I think that they were not selected, rather than out of order but I am not pinning myself to that statement in relation to every single amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. I am in some confusion because, with respect, there seems to be some difference between yourself and Mr. Lamond on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept full responsibility for all that was done, as I am the regular Chairman of the Committee. Mr. Lamond took the last sitting as a convenience and assistance to myself, but I made the decisions in that selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English, but may I draw your attention to what, in your absence, Mr. Lamond said to the Committee on your behalf when he was acting as Chairman? May I draw your attention to the proceedings of our Committee on 11 December when Mr. Lamond said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It might be helpful to the right Hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I made this point. I cannot say how Mr. Speaker will judge these matters, but in my view it would not be possible to amend this clause unless and until amendments have been made to the substantive clauses which follow. The position when it came before Mr. Speaker would be possibly that amendments had been made to the substantive clauses. Therefore, the position would be altered."</p></blockquote>
I think that Mr. Lamond meant that the position would be altered when it came before Mr. Speaker. He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"At the moment no amendments have been made to the clauses following clause 1, and therefore, in my opinion, no amendments are possible in clause 1."</p></blockquote>
Then, Mr. English, I draw your attention to what Mr. Lamond said in his second sentence,
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 1 is, in effect, a list of the contents of Part 1. In my view, as I have already said, it unless and until amendments have been made to the substantive clauses that follow. That means, of course, that once we have debated clause 1 on the stand part motion there is no going back. The position, of course, is that when the Bill reaches the Chamber again, on Report, the Speaker will select such amendments as he feels appropriate. Certainly, it would be within his jurisdiction to select amendments to clause 1 as a result of subsequent amendments in later clauses. At the present time it would not be possible to amend this clause until amendments have been made to substantive clauses which follow. I have not, therefore, selected any of the amendments tabled by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and his colleagues. It will be in order to have a broad general stand part debate about the purposes and ambit of part I of the Bill in which the right hon. Gentleman will no doubt be able to refer to a number of the points he is concerned with in the amendments which have not been selected. I would hope, However, that hon. Members will not use the debate to go into too much detail on the individual purposes of part I which will be more appropriately discussed when the relevant clauses are reached. As I say, clause 1 is, in effect, a list of contents"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Lamond also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The right hon. Gentleman has raised a point of substance in his remarks in looking at amendment No. 10. I would be prepared to look at my ruling"</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether the word "my" includes both himself and yourself, Mr. English—
<br><blockquote><p>"before Thursday, but I point out that any debate arising on amendment Number 10. would be extremely narrow and that proper debate would be best. If members of the Committee wish to have a substantial debate on this matter it would be better raised on a later clause."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Certainly, I should be prepared to look at that ruling with regard to amendment No. 10 because of the point mentioned."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 11 December 1979; cc. 43–48.]</p></blockquote>
I will not quote any further, Mr. English, but I could also quote column 49. I think it is clear from what Mr. Lamond said that there was a ruling that these amendments, as tabled before the meeting on Tuesday, were not admissible, and it was not simply a case that the Chair had exercised discretion—a discretion which we all accept—in deciding which amendments to select, and in the wisdom of the Chair he decided to select none. We were told in your absence, Mr. English, that none of the amendments tabled before Tuesday was in order, but that Mr. Lamond would consider, according to his words, whether it was possible for him to change what he described as his ruling in respect of amendment No. 10.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the use of "our" instead of "my" in that context might have been more appropriate. Mr. Lamond was substantially quoting from a text which we had agreed. I have another copy of it here. Like other Chairmen of this or any other Committee, after hon. Members had made their representations in the columns mentioned by the hon. Member, he offered to reconsider the rul-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
ing and we have done so. You can see in the provisional selection of amendments, amendments Nos. 8 and 10. There is nothing unusual in that. Chairmen as well as other hon. Members are at liberty, within the rules of order, to change their mind, and endeavour to do so if it is for the convenience of members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to clarify that there had been a change. I think you said a few minutes ago, Mr. English, that there had been no such ruling and that it was simply a matter of the discretion of the Chair in deciding which amendments were to be called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite say that. When the hon. Gentleman sees the text of the proceedings, he will see that he is slightly misquoting what I said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very sad day. Speaking as one who sat on the transport Bill Committee in 1978 for some 25 weeks I find it sad that this Committee has begun in this manner. Obviously, nobody is to blame. However, it would have been reasonable if the Government had stood up a long time ago in the interests of progress and put forward the proposition of discussing clause 1 at the end of part I. This is the sole reason for the opposition to the procedure motion.<br><br>
If we look at the minutes we seem to have been told at that point at the last meeting that, whilst we in Committee could not amend clause 1 it could be done on the Floor of the House. It seems reasonable that the Government could have stood up a long time ago and accepted that clause 1 be amended. It is important to look beyond the discussions in Committee and even on the Floor of the House. We have to look to the stage where the Bill becomes an Act. Any lawyer worth his salt will make a large amount of fat fees out of the words "the purpose", because everything else follows from that point. Whatever one does with subsequent clauses, the purpose will be deemed by the legal profession to be the intent of the Bill. That is why it is extremely important. If the Government had said that they could get over the difficulty of clause 1 by discussing and making it amendable at the end of the Bill, a great deal of this somewhat fruitless and negative discussion could have been avoided.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
It also contains the major repeals. After the last meeting we found ourselves in great difficulty because all the amendments were, in effect, ruled out of order, but with the proviso that they would be looked at.<br><br>
But if all those amendments were ruled out of order, what, we had to consider, was likely to be ruled in? A clear indication was being given that because clause 1 stated only "The purposes" and that will be vital when the Bill becomes an Act. We were told initially that we could not amend clause 1. Subsequently we have been told that we can now amend it. Certain amendments have been selected some of a purely drafting nature. Am I to understand, Mr. English, given the value of your vast experience, that further amendments to clause 1 would be acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman is simple. Nobody would dream of committing themselves to hypothetical amendments. If hon. Members wish to draft amendments and submit them to the Clerk in the normal way they will be considered upon their merits. I cannot possibly give the hon. Gentleman a blanket assurance that amendments will be selected when they are not even drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have been very surprised if this blanket assurance had been given. The difference, from the last sitting till now, is that we have the assurance from the Chair that further amendments will be considered. That is a very important gain. We had the ludicrous situation of walking into this Committee with the full sheet of amendments, only some of which would have been selected. In essence at that stage, we were being asked to start this Bill with a debate on clause 1 stand part. Is there any precedent for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was once in the Chair when a Bill went through in three minutes because there was no discussion and no amendment. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to follow that precedent I will be very happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. I appreciate the speed at which you chair sittings. Maybe it should go in the Guinness Book of Records.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Could I ask for the title of the Bill which was referred to?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I have forgotten it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was so fast.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad for that intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis), because, on leaving this Committee, I shall make it my business to find out the name of the Bill. No doubt my hon. Friends will get together and see if we can get it into the Guinness Book of Records. However, leaving that very fast and serious point, let us return to the business at hand. The Minister said that this was a very complex Bill and we want the fullest discussion. He was applauded right across this Committee, rightly so. We want the fullest discussion and people outside want that, too. I do not think that it is too late for the Minister and his colleagues to consider reversing the procedure and allowing us to debate clause 1 last. That would make sense. It is being said that the Department of Transport is so efficient—no doubt it is—that it cannot make a mistake in the purposes of clause 1.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Until today we were under the impression that clause 1 was unamendable and in the interests of people outside we were not to be allowed to discuss it, other than in the debate on the clause stand part. The decision that was reached this morning—and I appreciate it, Mr. English —means that we are now in a position to amend the clause, but I hope that you appreciate the situation we were in, not knowing until we entered this room this morning whether our amendments would even be valid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we have discussed this matter at sufficient length. It is certainly not something I would be prepared to permit if a reasonable reconsideration such as Mr. Lamond indulged in at the last sitting were in itself a cause of discussion. The Chair endeavours to help the members of the Committee, and did so by reconsidering this particular point. There is an old adage about not looking gift horses in the mouth.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it will assist, Mr. English, if I reply briefly to the debate at this stage. I appreciate that the Opposition do not want to deal with the Bill with undue haste, but nevertheless it seems to me that the arguments are reasonably clear. I appreciate the difficulty the Committee was in at the last sitting. It is unusual to have a Bill containing 57 clauses and nine schedules, all of a controversial nature, and, at the first sitting of the Committee, for the Opposition, having tabled 12 amendments, to find that they have not been selected. That was an unusual situation and I can understand that it gave rise to some fears. In particular, it appeared at that stage to give rise to fears that it might not be possible to discuss such major issues as the abolition of express carriage licences and the way in which the Bill intends to make it easier to obtain road service licences and so on.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend the Minister made clear at the last sitting, and subject, of course, to your ruling, Mr. English, any discussion on clause 1 can in no way cut out the very substantial debates we would have on the later substantive clauses. We can go on to discuss them once we begin to make progress.<br><br>
Amendments that were tabled last week were not selected, but it is clear from today's selection that it was not intended to rule out possible amendments. Indeed, it may help us to make progress if I indicate at this stage that it is possible that the amendments that have been selected will be accepted by the Government when we move on to discuss them. I hope that that will be helpful. I hope that we do not have second thoughts, should a great deal of time elapse before we get on with the first amendment, but as of now it is likely that we will accept the first amendment.<br><br>
The first half of clause 1 could affect the interpretation of the Bill if doubts arise about the purposes of Parliament in enacting the substantial clauses. That is a matter that we can debate on clause 1. The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has already touched upon this, but it seems to me, again subject to your ruling, Mr. English, that that is a matter which we can consider very fully once we get on to the debate on clause stand part. If we get on to that debate as you have indicated, Mr. English, we can then have a general debate on the pur-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
poses of the Bill. I would have thought that would be helpful to the Committee.<br><br>
Naturally, in considering the Bill it would help if we cleared the air, as it were, by having a general debate about the purposes of the Bill as envisaged by the Government. The Opposition could then deploy their case, challenge the purposes set out, and indicate why they feel certain of them should be removed. That would make our debates interesting to those outside; it would enable people at an early stage in our proceedings to see exactly the position of the Government and of the Opposition, what we are seeking to achieve and what they are seeking to frustrate.<br><br>
The usual procedure in Committee is to deal with clause 1 before going on to clause 2, and so on. That makes for the orderly conduct of debate, and I think it is clear that it would be right to take clause 1 first. Having heard all the discussion, I do not think that anything has been put forward which should make us reconsider the motion we have put down, and I trust that we can now clear the procedural matters.<br><br>
I entirely share the view of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) that it is unfortunate if too much time is taken on procedure.<br><br>
There are many people interested in this Bill who will read our proceedings. Many have no doubt eagerly awaited the first report of the Committee. Most, I feel, will be utterly bewildered to find that the Opposition have spent so long talking about an extremely narrow procedural motion and if we now make progess—let us say we could go to an amendment which I am minded to accept—and then go straight into a general debate in which I am sure my hon. Friends and all the Labour Members will anxious to take part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to protest at the content of that speech by the Parliamentary Secretary. Matters have now become quite clear from this debate that were not clear to begin with and on which the Opposition asked for co-operation from the government in an approach to the chair. We would have been quite happy to have, made these actual approaches to get us out of our difficulties. We received no co-operative response to that except to say, "It is not up to us, it is up to the Chair". Of course we accept that, but as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
a Chairman would be more easily persuaded if both sides of a Committee were to say that they could foresee difficulties. If we cannot remove the clause then we can leave it in the Bill—I have no strong feelings as to its removal—but at least we could consider it at the end of part 1. That was, indeed, one of our aims with the procedure motion.<br><br>
We have before us a procedure motion. It is a bit much to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary accusing us of delaying the Bill when the whole issue was quite clear on the first day that apparently, for whatever reason, we could amend clause 1. We now accept the interpretation given by you, Mr. English.<br><br>
I would like to put on record, Mr. English, that whatever our criticism, you have a difficult job and as had Mr. Lamond on Tuesday. We have received the most courteous attention from you both in dealing with our difficulties in this matter. In that sense, we have no criticism whatsoever.<br><br>
However, now the Parliamentary Secretary has said that he is quite prepared to accept our amendment, provided we do not delay. Therefore now the possibility now exists that there may be other amendments that he could possibly accept.<br><br>
We were limited in the amendments we have put down. That was, as we explained, because we needed time to put proper and substantial amendments down rather than rushing out with a lot of "delete" and "take out" amendments. But the people who could advise us as to the substance of the amendments did not have sufficient time to give us that information.<br><br>
The complexities of the radical changes which the Government have proposed in this Bill pose difficulties for those giving us information—and considerable amounts of information are coming to us. Therefore, if the possibility exists that the Chair might consider other amendments we want to look afresh at that to see whether there are parts now that can be amended. We are however, accused of delay if we carry out our proper function of amending the clause. Once we have moved on to clause stand part there is no way that the Chairman can accept amendments to the clause. Let us be honest. When looking at these matters assessments are made by as long it will take to go through a particular clause. I know it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
is supposed to be the role of Oppositions to delay. In no way have we sought to delay the Committee, except perhaps on the first sitting, when many of us felt very unhappy at having to make arguments about procedure and be repetitive—it is on the record for anyone who wants to read it.<br><br>
Conservative Members may shake their heads and pass comments, but our endeavours have proved things that various points were not correctly interpreted. The Conservatives have a responsibility to scrutinise legislation as much as we have. All we have heard is mumbles but not one speech from any of them about any of the matters which affect their constituents as much as they affect ours. I hope we can prompt them this time not to make comments about delay but to do their job—not to write letters, but to scrutinise the legislation.<br><br>
Perhaps that is a lesson we might start off with on this Bill. My right hon. Friend said that it took 25 weeks to get the 1978 Bill through—that was when the present Government were in Opposition. I recommend Government Back Benchers to read the <i>Official Report</i> of the Committee sittings on that Bill. They will find that most of the debate came from the Labour side, and we were in Government.<br><br>
I know that Back Benchers are expected to keep quiet but I thought I might just appeal to them to think about their statutory obligations, and indeed their political ones, in scrutinising legislation. We would contend, Mr. English, that this procedure motion leaves us in considerable difficulty, as was pointed out by my right hon. Friend. We are not able now at this stage to debate on clause 1, which is relevant to the whole Procedure motion. In view of our difficulties I think we are left with no alternative but to oppose the procedure motion. We are in a bit of a "Catch-22" situation, and I hope that you can give further guidance before we get to any clause 1 debates—certainly before we get to the debate on clause stand part, Mr. English, as to whether the clause changes the law, or whether it merely gives notice of what the Bill intends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it happens, the Minister is a very able lawyer himself, so I think I will leave him to answer that question when we come to it. I am hoping to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
be pleasantly surprised, but the idea that we are likely to reach the debate of clause stand part at this sitting is something which I have not hitherto contemplated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that you will accept, Mr. English, whatever your thoughts about the speed at which the Committee moves, that one of the reasons for delay, especially at our first sitting more than today perhaps, was because we were unhappy. I admit that there was some delay. Parliamentary procedures mean that delays are incurred in the passing of Bills, so that a proper assessment of the Bill can be made. I do not know what the three-minute Bill that you mentioned was, Mr. English, but certainly anybody who listened to the Rhodesia debate last night is not convinced of the wisdom of rushing through legislation at high speed. It is our job to analyse the Bill, and I will be quite frank and honest about it, there was some delay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that we delayed the Bill has meant the selection of amendments to a previously unamendable clause. One would assume that if we had just accepted the position we would have been discussing clause stand part now, rather than discussing an amendment to a clause which we were previously told could not be amended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have confirmation from the Chair that any amendment is, quite rightly, treated on its merits. I think it was also brought out that Chairmen, like anyone else, are entitled to look at rulings when arguments are presented to them; that is the function which the Chairman carried out and we are grateful to him. But my point is that we felt strongly about that point on the first day, and if we had listened to the Government and listened to hon. Gentlemen arguing the case that perhaps we should go on to clause 2, we would have missed out on an important point here.<br><br>
I think the question of whether the Bill merely indicates to the courts in this clause, or whether it changes the law is very important, and we look forward to a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary on that point. It is of considerable relevance to us in our approach to clause 1. Indeed I would suggest that the Government should perhaps start thinking about whether it would be better if clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
1 were taken out of the Bill, though I got some indication of the Government's thinking when the Parliamentary Secretary said that the clause gave an opportunity of showing the country at large where parties stood on particular issues. Perhaps that is the intention. Perhaps clause 1 is caught up with the political actions and definitions of the position outside this House. We will wait to see that, bearing in mind that one of the controversial amendments that we will seek to put forward on Land Transport is one that is clearly in the mind of the electors and of those who hope to be elected at the present time.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
We have established our case this morning, Mr. English. There certainly has been a need to establish a case for amendments. We hope that we have the opportunity now to give further consideration to other amendments than those selected because the Government have shown willingness to recognise the arguments in suggesting that amendment Number 10 will possibly be accepted when we reach it.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>Motion made, and Question proposed, that the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 3, Schedule 1, Clause 4 to 12, Schedule 2, Clauses 13 to 20, Schedule 3, Clauses 21 to 32, Schedule 4, Clauses 33 and 34, Schedule 5, Clause 35, New Clauses and New Schedules relating to Part I of the Bill, Clause 36, Schedule 6, Clauses 37 to 42, Schedule 7, New Clauses and new Schedules relating to part II of the Bill, Clauses 43 to 50, Schedule 8, new Clause and new Schedules relating to Part III of the Bill, Clauses 51 to 57, remaining new Clauses, remaining new Schedules and Schedule 9.</p></blockquote></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
<p>There might be a new air of co-operation now, since we have established a point in Committee. The Parliamentary Secretary should not say to us that he will not accept the amendment unless we cooperate and speed up the process. Frankly, the amendment should be judged on its merits, not on the basis of whether we co-operate. If we had cooperated in the way he suggested, we should not have had the amendment for him to consider accepting.</p>
<p>The arguments on procedure have been inevitably caught up in clause 1, but I think we have substantiated our point. I know it is somewhat late in the day for a procedure to be found whereby clause 1 may be got out of these difficulties.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put.</span></p>

<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 6.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. The Committee has now voted and decided the order in which to take the clauses and therefore the amendments. I should like to make a submission to you. Will you consider the possibility of adjourning the Committee now, because I suggest that an important decision has been taken. We have decided the order, and this morning we have had a change of ruling from the Chair. May I explain—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. As he will know, it is customary for the hon. Member in charge of the Bill, in this case the Minister, to move motions for the Adjournment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. May I have your guidance, Mr. English, as to what action may be taken apart from an initiative by the Minister? The experience we have had during the last sitting and this morning does not lead us to believe that the Minister will take any such initiative. I am therefore in a quandary and a difficulty.<br><br>
It is always possible that we may persuade the Minister to see what we regard as common sense—[<i>Interruption.</i>] but as the only way we can address our remarks is through the Chair I should be grateful if you, Mr. English, would allow me to explain why I make this submission.<br><br>
At our sitting on Tuesday we were given a ruling. We accepted it. We were concerned about it and we made representations. I do not complain about that ruling. I am sure it was made in the utmost good faith. Nevertheless, the ruling was made, and today it has been changed. I suggest that the ruling which we were given on Tuesday, or at least the ruling that we were led to expect—I submit that you must allow me that—about the admissibility of amendments, was certainly held effective whether amendments were put down or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and certain other hon. Gentlemen are in grave danger of talking themselves into the belief that the Chair has totally reversed itself. This is not so. At the last sitting the alternative Chairman offered to consider the question of amendment No. 10 with which, of course, amendment No. 8 is inseparably linked. That has been done. One is always prepared to consider any other amendments should we not reach clause stand part this morning. But it does not follow that such a consideration will automatically lead to amendments being selected that were not selected before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. English, but may I explain why I am concerned? We were given to understand that the clause was not amendable, and this would certainly have discouraged Back Benchers from putting down—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the text of the actual ruling in front of me, and while it may have been misinterpreted, and possibly might have been phrased differently, the intention of the Chair, which was carried out by the alternate Chairman, was to explain that it was difficult to draft an amendment to the clause that would be both in order and capable of being selected. But to say that something is difficult does not mean that it is impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what you say, Mr. English, and I am grateful for your explanation.<br><br>
But may I put to the Minister through you that some of us at least would have been discouraged from putting down amendments. The Minister has now indicated that he may be prepared—he has not committed himself—to accept amendment No. 10. The problem then is that we shall go straight on to the clause stand part debate, if I understand the procedure correctly, and we shall not be able to table other amendments. On Tuesday, Mr. Lamond said that he would not accept manuscript amendments. Therefore, we shall not be able to put down amendments to clause 1 in an attempt to have them selected. Unless we adjourn we shall have passed the appropriate stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman perhaps has a lower regard for the wit of his colleagues than he should. I should have thought that it would have been possible, and not beyond them, to discuss the amendment during the remainder of this morning's sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. I hope that you will not take anything said by my hon. Friend as implying criticism. I hope that we have not appeared somewhat obtuse in considering some of the clear and valuable guidance that you have given us. We appreciate, and I think it is helpful to put it on record, that when we table amendments there are two considerations which you have to bear in mind.<br><br>
Of course on the fundamental one as to whether they are in order, we appreciate that we may not succeed in drafting all or our amendments so that they are all in order. We now understand from your ruling that a number of those amendments which were tabled before Tuesday's sitting were in order and that the consider-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
ation which laid doubts as to whether they should be debated related to whether it would be for the convenience of the Committee and make for orderly debate.<br><br>
I very much appreciate that and, having that in mind, I approached the Minister. I felt that it would be helpful if he and I could have made some joint submissions to you to indicate what might have been agreed views from both sides of the Committee as to what was for its convenience. I did not get a response to that then, but I hope that I am not stretching optimism too far and that I am not a little too early in imagining forming interpretation of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that the Christmas spirit is abroad. I think he was indicating, albeit in a way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member is strictly on a point of order but I am not quite clear what it is yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry Mr. English, I shall try to come to my point of order. Allowing that we do not terminate our debate on amendments Nos. 8 and 10, would it be in order for the Minister and I, jointly or separately, to make submissions to you, Mr. English, as to certain other amendments solely on the grounds that it might be for the convenience of the Committee to have a limited but orderly debate as to "purposes" on clause 1. We should of course understand that in considering those submissions, you would be considering only such amendments as were in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that every member of the Committee will be well aware that this sitting will inevitably end at 1 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English, we shall have amendment No. 8 before us for discussion. There were other amendments which have not been selected and we are in a difficulty about whether other amendments may be selected. If we wish to ask why other amendments were not selected when would it be in order to seek your reconsideration, Mr. English? Should we do it before we start the debate? If we move on to amendment No. 8 will we be denied any chance to argue for amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If amendment No. 8
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
had been moved and if it has been carried, hon. Members clearly could not go back in the clause to an earlier stage than that which was covered by amendment No. 8. The same applies to amendment No. 10. If however an amendment were moved and subsequently withdrawn with the permission of the Committee, the clause would be open to amendment from the first word, if it was possible to produce an amendment which was in order and capable of being selected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>; You mean by that a manuscript amendment, presumably, Mr. English?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would sincerely hope that there would be real need for consideration of such amendments. I think that it is unlikely that such a necessity will arise.</span></p>

Preliminary</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in 1, page 2, leave out 'and'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 10, in 1, page 2 line 8, after 'Licences', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and (h) providing an appeal a refusal by the London Transport Executive to enter into an agreement with a person other than the Executive for the provision of a London Bus Service'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments are tabled to Bills for various purposes. They are sometimes moved to provide a way of indicating a judgment on the part of those who table them as to the Form the legislation should take, a judgment in which they dissent from the government as the proposers of the Bill. They are sometimes moved in order to obtain information, and they are sometimes moved in order that the legislation may be improved, in order that it might be clearer, in order that its purpose might be fully understood<br><br>
In amendments No. 8 and 10 there is an element of all three. If we are convinced by the Parliamentary Secretary that the purpose of the Bill is right in this respect and that it is an important purpose, then we would see these amendments as servicing the cause of good legislation by at least getting some constituencies in clause 1. If, on the other hand—and it will be for the Minister to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
indicate to us whether this is so—it is the Government's intention in this construction that the courts should be guided by clause 1 as to how certain other clauses of part I operate, but not guided as to others—that is to say, in others it would be for the courts to be guided only by the wording of a single clause—then we shall have to look at the matter again.<br><br>
The specific issue of these amendments stems from a declared purpose in the long title, but not in clause 1, namely, to provide an appeal against decisions by the London Transport Executive on applications which have to be made to them under the present law by anybody who wants to come into London to operate a service.<br><br>
We would like to know what criteria the Minister is using in determining what is an appropriate role for traffic commissioners. The form of appeal that is laid out in the Bill runs in exactly the contrary direction to that in which it runs in all other parts which deal with the role of traffic commissioners. On all matters other than the provision of bus services by operators other than London Transport within the London Transport area, the role of the traffic commissioners is curtailed. The commissioners are curtailed by this Bill in many ways in their dealings with the issue of fares as to the criteria which they should exercise. It is a Bill which, generally speaking, has in its first part an aim of limiting the role of the commissioners, of curtailing their power, of making it easier for people to press their views against views which, as of now, can be exercised by the commissioners in judgment.<br><br>
When we come to the London part of the Bill the role of the commissioners is opened up. They are given a power which they do not possess under present legislation. I was going to say that they have never had it before, but I will have to check that. But, certainly, it is a power which they do not possess, a power to do things ehich commissioners in other areas will not be allowed to do.<br><br>
So, first, we need, on this question of a purpose defined in clause 1, to know what are the criteria which the Minister will exercise. This will come up again and again as we go through the Bill in defining the role of commissioners and discussing why that criteria is so wide as to allow the power to be extended in London and cur-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
tailed elsewhere. I appreciate that to judge this issue fairly one has to look at the peculiar nature of London's services, and I do not propose to go into that at the moment. However, there is in this part of the Bill a special duty and a special responsibility of the London Transport Executive, which, again, is curtailed.<br><br>
I know that it is held by some that LTE, in deciding what bus services run in London, is judge and jury in its own court; that it considers the applications, it decides them, and when it has decided them, there is no appeal. It is a final arbitrary authority on who should be running the service.<br><br>
Therefore when determining whether this is a proper and appropriate purpose to put into clause 1, we have to consider whether there is any evidence that this system which exists now of allowing LTE to make this determination has worked effectively or badly. We have to take a view whether, as was implied by the Minister in his Second Reading speech, we have operating at present a very rigid, inflexible system, one which stops changes being made in stage carriage routes, one which stops new operators coming in or places very formidable barriers in their way.<br><br>
On reading this part of the Bill, I contacted LTE. I talked to a number of people who operate in the area, and I asked for the statistics of applications for new services to find out how London Transport has worked in this way. I found that LTE over the past five years has agreed to 99 applications from other operators to come into London and to provide services in London, and has refused 23—hardly evidence that the present system prevents any other operators from coming in and running in London. Of the 23 refusals, I think that more than half were for a single service, a rather peculiar service which might figure later in our debates when we come to discuss this matter in detail. Here we are not discussing it in detail. We are, of course, discussing purpose. It is no doubt a service which some people would consider a very profitable one to run, but the grounds on which it was turned down, as far as I can ascertain, were not related solely to that matter. They also related to matters which I know will concern the Committee in later stages—the sort of vehicles which were to be used and the sort of people who would drive them.<br><br>
To clear this point, first of all, we would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
ask the Parliamentary Secretary for what purpose there is included in the Bill an appeal against a body which has not, in exercising its duty up to now, been intractable or had any implacable opposition to new operators coming in. On the contrary, it has agreed the great majority of applications put before it.<br><br>
There is also the consideration, that, if it is accepted that the body which is primarily concerned with deciding whether new operators will come into an area should be subject to an appeal procedure, why should that be peculiar to London? We understand that London services are highly complex. They should be well integrated. We may need a higher proportion per square mile of operations than any other part of the country. But that cannot change our view about whether the basic decision is one which should be subject to appeal.<br><br>
Finally on this issue, there is a difficulty which we have on the purpose of the Bill, which was not referred to on our Second Reading, so far as I can see, and certainly not in the proceedings of the Committee subsequently. It concerns the factors that will be taken into account in an appeal or an initial procedure in this case.<br><br>
I suggest that whatever body is to listen to the views of other operators in the area before deciding in what circumstances the role of operators should be changed or new operators should be admitted, that cannot be decided on a basis peculiar to London. If it is right, it is right for every county and metropolitan operation. Yet there is no reference to this in the Bill. There is no reference to who should be consulted, and even more strange, there are no references to the criteria to be used by the commissioners.<br><br>
In other areas, the criteria to be used by the commissioners are spelt out very clearly in the Bill. For London and the metropolitan services—the very area in which there is change of procedure, a major change in the role of commissioner and an expansion of his powers in contradistinction to the way the Bill operates on commissioners in any other part of the country—the criteria are not laid down. Therefore, to enable us to discuss this matter covered by amendments Nos. 8 and 10 properly, it would be very helpful if we could have some guidance from the Minister on these specific points which we will then be able to consider more fully.<br><br>
What criterion is the Minister exercis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
ing? What has he in mind about the proper role of commissioners which makes their role so different in London as opposed to the rest of the country? Has he accepted a criterion which up to now has outlived its usefulness? Is it his contention that any appeal against the LTE's decision should be regarded as a reflection on the way that it has carried out its duties, or does he concede that on the evidence which is at present available to the Committee, it has carried out those duties fairly and properly and has not prevented the operators coming into London.<br><br>
Finally, can the Minister indicate to us how we can discuss the purpose of the Bill in respect of this operation in London and its appeal rights without knowing what guidance there should be about how the commissioner carries out his role. Why should commissioners in the rest of the country have such clear, detailed guidance—terms of reference, as it were, specifically laid out in the Bill—but not have them in London where they are always being opened up?<br><br>
If we could have that information, we could then proceed to debate this important purpose of the Bill. Without making too much of the point, I hope that the Minister will say why this purpose was not included among his other purposes. Obviously it is one of our intentions in putting this amendment down to find out how one distinguishes between the purpose of the Bill in clause 1 and those purposes in part 1 and do not appear in clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could invite the Minister to give us some indication. This is an amendment of some substance. We are concerned about it, and that is why the amendment has now been accepted. If he could explain to us, we may begin to save some time if we know how it is intended to work and what is the Government thinking behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly I will respond to that. As it has already been discussed and debated quite extensively on the points of order that we had, this part of clause 1 is really explanatory of what follows, and there is a list of the major provisions of part I of the Bill. The purpose of this part of clause 1 is to simplify and clarify the aims of the Bill and, therefore, to assist those who will have to interpret and use it. It is not an exhaustive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
list. It does not purport to list every provision of part I. The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) claimed earlier on that by describing the purposes as "the purposes", it was purporting to be an exhaustive list when it was not. It is not an exhaustive list, but if we read the first line of clause 1—
<br><blockquote><p>"The purposes for which this Part is enacted include"</p></blockquote>
—the word "include" makes clear that the list that follows is not intended to be exhaustive or total. There is nothing sinister about the selection from clause 1 (l)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) of the principal purposes which have been listed. They were believed by Government and by the parliamentary draftsmen to be principal purposes and were set out accordingly.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
There is no distinction between those purposes and the one which is now sought to be added to the Bill by the amendment. As that amendment is an accurate description of a substantial change in part I of the Bill—an accurate description of the provisions of clause 28, in fact—the Government see no objection to including it.<br><br>
I believe that clause 1 (1) will be of assistance to the courts when interpreting the Bill if any difficulties arise over the interpretation of later clauses. In considering how to interpret legislation before them, courts pay regard to the context of an Act itself, because they do not have regard to any discussions that have taken place in Parliament, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
If any doubts arise, therefore, in later proceedings, for example, about what was Parliament's intention in making changes such as those proposed in the Bill to the criteria for the obtaining of road service licences, it would be helpful for the courts to be able to refer to clause 1(1) (<i>c</i>) where the provision was set out. The intention of Parliament is to ease the restrictions and therefore, if anyone argues in subsequent proceedings that a change in the Bill should be interpreted in such a way as to narrow the criteria for road service licences, it will be plain to anyone and of assistance to a court or a commissioner that Parliament's intention was the reverse. Parliament seeks to make the application easier and, therefore, any doubtful provisions will be interpreted in that way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
Concerning the amendment, I do not see that that sort of problem will arise with the description which is to be added,
<br><blockquote><p>"providing an appeal against a refusal by the London Transport Executive".</p></blockquote>
It appears to be a straightforward description of clause 28. In respect of the appeal to the Metropolitan Traffic Commissioners in the case of a refusal of an agreement by the London Transport Executive, I suggest that that topic can be most conveniently debated when we reach clause 28.<br><br>
We are considering now whether we should add to clause 1 this restriction of provisions later contained in clause 28. But at this stage I shall give only a general description of what we propose.<br><br>
London is in a different category from the rest of the country. We all know that the LTE has a statutory position which is not matched anywhere else in the country. When we consider the problem of London, therefore, it is clear that unless we go in for a major reform of the entire arrangements of the London Transport Executive, we shall have to deal with London in a special way. In fact, when considering the Bill we were anxious to deal with London in a fairly limited way. We did not wish to engage now on a major re-examination of the role of the LTE and its function.<br><br>
It seemed to us, on the other hand, that it would be anomalous to ease restrictions on new operations and new services in the rest of the country, and make no change whatever in London, so that the LTE would be able to exclude every applicant if at its discretion it so wished and prevent changes taking place in London services of a kind which we seek to encourage in the rest of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What possible justification can the Minister have for that remark? We have seen the effect of London Transport Executive operating precisely the powers that it has now, and over the past five years there is no evidence that the LTE has refused every applicant. On the contrary, it has granted to the majority of applicants who have agreements with it, the agreements that those applicants have sought. Why should the Minister, on the basis he is now putting before us, suggest that the LTE will suddenly change and start refusing every applicant?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that the LTE will suddenly change as I have no control over the London Transport Executive. All I say is that it seemed to us to be wrong for the law to be left in such a way that, if it wished, London Transport Executive could refuse to enter into agreements to admit new forms of service and new operators of a kind that, in the course of time, proved to be successful in other parts of the country.<br><br>
We have provided in the Bill what is accurately described in this amendment,—a form of appeal against any refusal by the London Transport Executive so that it shall not be judge and jury in its own case. I am not suggesting—if I seem to be doing so, I withdraw it—that the London transport Executive has been unnecessarily restrictive; I am not suggesting that I have any reason for thinking it will be. I should like to think that when London Transport Executive sees what is proposed in the Bill, sees that the proposals for most of the country are that there should be an opening up of road passenger transport innovation, new services and more competition, it will reflect that in its own policy. But if there should be disputes between London Transport and any other operator who wants to come into London and provide some service, either complementary to London Transport or in competition with it, it seems to us to be right that London Transport should not remain the judge in its own cause and that some provision for appeal should be made. Whether we have got the right form of appeal in the Bill is a matter which we can most conveniently debate when we get to clause 28.<br><br>
I listened with interest to what the right hon. Gentleman said. It is certainly right that this is the one and only instance in the Bill of a new right of appeal being given to commissioners. It is also right that, as the Bill stands, it sets out no precise criteria upon which the commissioners are bound; in fact, it gives them an unfettered discretion to come to such conclusions as seem to them to fit in the case of any individual appeal. But I trust and anticipate that the traffic commissioners will act in the public interest as they see it—in the interests of public transport in London—and weigh arguments which one assumes, as we are contemplating the dispute would come from London Transport, about the damage which might be done to public transport provision from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
the London Transport Executive against the arguments put forward by a new operator of a service that a service can be provided by him which, at the moment, is lacking to the travelling public in London, and come to a decision giving weight to such arguments as they think fit, on such evidence as they care to receive, which is in the interests of the travelling public.<br><br>
I would like to believe that the commissioners would follow that. I am sure they would follow some approach of that kind, because that would be in line with the general approach of this whole Bill. Where we lay down criteria, for instance, for the provision of new road service licences, we have tried in the Bill to lay the heaviest emphasis on the public interest—the interests of the travelling public. That seems to me to be the main consideration to be borne in mind in the salient question of road passenger transport.<br><br>
It seems to the Government that in the past there has been a tendency to give undue weight to the interests of the existing operators of public passenger services, and those who work for them. There has been a tendency to forget that the most important interest of all is that of the customer. Our bus services are not provided for the benefit of the bus operators. They are not even provided for the benefit of those who drive the buses and work upon them. They are intended for the benefit of the travelling public and, just as we hope that our new provisions on the award of new road service licences will concentrate people's minds upon the benefits of the travelling public, so we hope in London when the Metropolitan Commissioners are hearing appeals in the case of failure to reach agreement between the London Transport Executive and any new operators, their main consideration will be the interests of the travelling public in London.<br><br>
I am sure no one can deny that we should all give very careful consideration to the interests of the travelling public in London, because they are a rather long-suffering section of the community. The present arrangements in London for any form of travel, whether commuting or internal within London, are far from ideal. It cannot be the case that there is not room for innovation and new services and some new thought on passenger travel in London. We hope by the provisions of the Bill to open a small avenue, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
another possible avenue, by which fresh people could come along and offer new services. If the LTE for some reason tries to block those new services by entering into agreements, there will be an appeal to a third party in order to sort the matter out.<br><br>
I will listen with interest and will consider what the hon. Member says and of course my right hon. Friend and I will listen again, when we come to clause 28, to all the arguments about the form of appeal. We have not closed our minds on the precise form of appeal. As the Bill stands, we are suggesting that the appeal from the LTE should be to the Metropolitan Traffic Commissioners. If that is thought anomalous, certainly our minds are not closed to some other possible forms of appeal, even perhaps to the Minister, in line with the provisions of the remainder of the Bill. As it stands, we are proposing an appeal to the Traffic Commissioners and, as I say, when we come to clause 28, I think that is the most convenient time to consider the substance of the matter, to consider whether the Metropolitan Commissioners are the correct body to whom appeals should be directed, and to consider precisely what criteria the Metropolitan Commissioners should follow.<br><br>
I trust that that is sufficient assistance for the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). If I understood what he was saying, I think that what I have covered is the sort of area on which he wanted guidance.<br><br>
I conclude, therefore, with perhaps the most welcome part of what I have to say, which is that the Government can certainly accept the amendment. As I have said, it is an accurate description of the later part of the Bill, it would in no way inhibit the operation of the Bill, it is a welcome amendment, and I am therefore delighted to able to say that the very first amendment selected is one which the Government can accept. I cannot promise that every amendment moved later will receive the same ready acceptance, but all will receive hearing and consideration.<br><br>
If, in the light of what I have said, the hon. Gentleman is prepared to agree with me that we should discuss the substance of the matter later on and is happy that we should accept the amendment, I anticipate that we may be in some difficulties because he said a few moments ago that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
his fear then would be that we should move on to clause 1 stand part, and he indicated that there might be other amendments to the clause which he would wish to consider.<br><br>
As you yourself said a few moments ago, Mr. English, you have no powers to adjourn the Committee. It is for the hon. Member in charge of the Bill to move an adjournment. If we accepted the amendment, I should be happy to adjourn the Committee at this stage to give the Opposition further time. I do not believe that considering amendments to this part of the Bill would exclude any amendments the Opposition wish to put down, because we shall have reached only line 5 on page 2, and there will still be room for amendments adding to the descriptive list in the first part of the clause, let alone all the amendments which I am sure could be drafted to the later subsections of the clause if the Opposition were so minded between now and next Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We on this side are undoubtedly charmed and mesmerised by the overtures of the Parliamentary Secretary, making offers of adjournments at 15 minutes to 1 o'clock. I know that Tory promises are not worth a lot. Nevertheless, I think that he has made a valid point. It has not been the intention of the Opposition to delay the Committee's deliberations unnecessarily, with the exception of the first day when we had a point to make—and we think today that we made it.<br><br>
The explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary is a very useful one and opens up other avenues of thought. As the Parliamentary Secretary and you, Mr. English, pointed out, we have a clause later on which we can debate these points in detail, so we do not give up the opportunity on that. It hangs a little on the legal opinion from the Parliamentary Secretary, put as though the clause, when passed, becomes law, but we are still operating on the lines that it is guidance to the Bill. We should like a definitive statement about exactly what it does mean. The Parliamentary Secretary made clear that it was to give guidance to those who were in some doubt, presumably of what the clause meant, so that they could refer to the intention of the Bill at the beginning.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
This almost quasi-legislation says that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0059">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
if we are unsure of what the draftsman said it was supposed to mean, we can go to the front of the Bill and that will give us a clear understanding. Whether lawyers will accept that, I do not know. It certainly seems to be contrary to what I understood the situation to be. It seems to be taking it a little further than the argument—which has not been accepted—that one reads what Parliament actually said in the debate. I understand that lawyers would carefully look at the clauses. Such provisions change quite often, particularly in trade union legislation. What a Bill actually says and what lawyers interpret it to mean are distinctly different from what the legislators intended it to mean. There are many examples of that, even outside trade union legislation. With this it is much more important than that. We should like a definitive statement about what clause 1 will mean, if we pass it, in its effect upon law and interpretations. I do not know. You quite rightly said, Mr. English, that the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a lawyer in his own right, can give us an understanding of the clause. I think it may need more than that. I think the Law Officers should give us some understanding as to what they think it means. With the greatest respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, I do not suppose he would want to take on the onerous job of giving the Committee that information. The Law Officers should give us their interpretation of what is the intent and possible meaning and effect of clause 1.<br><br>
We are very happy that the Parliamentary Secretary has accepted our amendment and justified our reasons for putting it down. Indeed, it was one of the first amendments that we drafted and it seemed to be an important one. It arose for a very good reason—and one of the reasons why we were in difficulties. Here was a major change to take place in the London Transport area. I shall seek to indicate to you, that it has implications for changes in other pieces of legislation which are not included in clause 1. I am surrounded by pieces of legislation which are affected by that decision, and, if the argument is that the intention and effect of clause 1 is to tell what is changed in legislation and how important that change is, it is relevant to argue from that, quite apart from arguing the case of the justification embodied in clause 28 and reflected in this amendment, that there are matters
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
to be further amended in the clause directly arising out of the acceptance of the amendment. I hope that I may be able to convince you, Mr. English, and put amendments down to that effect so that you can give due consideration to the argument.<br><br>
In his explanations the Parliamentary Secretary informed the Committee that he has no power over the commissioners but, on a loose reading of some of the legislation, I though it said that the Minister "can direct" commissioners. Indeed, we know that he appoints them, but he can direct them in certain matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bevan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always understood that they were appointed by the Master of the Rolls.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I get confused by the titles of various officers of the House. But I am sure the legislation said that the Minister appoints, that he appoints from a certain panel, and that he can direct. It is, I think, embodied in legislation—perhaps the point can be cleared up at some other stage—that the Minister had power of some kind over the traffic commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am assisting the hon. Gentleman to talk us out until one o'clock or whether we are trying to get an adjournment. I did compromise before.<br><br>
The appointment of traffic commissioners is by the Minister and, once appointed, their position is fairly judicial. They cannot be removed except in cases of bad behaviour. The Minister has a right to give directions to traffic commissioners. That power, I am told, has only been used on two occasions, both of them in 1931. The practice has arisen of not giving directions to traffic commissioners, and it is not the intention of the Government to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not resent being told it is time we made the point. That suggests we are delaying or talking for time. The Minister, at one stage, said that there was no power over the commissioners and I am suggesting that in the Bill there is. He has now informed us that that is true but it is not used.<br><br>
What is our job but to challenge statements if they are incorrect? That is all we are seeking to do in this case, because it is important to the burden of the argument I want to put to the Committee in justi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
fying other changes in legislation —namely, that the commissioners have a duty and responsibility imposed upon them by legislation, that those decisions have to be taken in the granting of licences based on criteria that are set out in the legislation, and that it is precisely spelled out in the pieces of legislation we have referred to.<br><br>
The distinctive difference with London Transport is that it was not subjected, in any decisions concerning the provision of services, to an appeal to the Metropolitan commissioners and, therefore, the Metropolitan commissioners did not have the same function—indeed, never had the same function; I will be corrected if it is not so—as other commissioners in other traffic areas. The London Transport Executive has a responsibility as the only authority to provide a London bus service, and anyone wishing to provide an alternative bus service has to apply to the Executive. The Government, by this amendment, seek to change fundamentally that position, and there will now be the right of an appeal, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, if an application is refused for a bus service on a route for which London has responsibility.<br><br>
The difficulty now begins to arise. If the commissioner has previously never dealt with the provision of licences, what criteria will he use to determine whether it is justifiable to grant a licence to a competitor in that area? We know that in the other areas there is a tremendous amount of case law to guide the commissioners. It has been built up since 1930, and to assist in the development of case law legislation laid down specifically the criteria that the commissioners had to consider in providing the service. The Bill is called "radical" because it changes quite substantially the criteria to be considered by the commissioners in granting any such licence.<br><br>
We know what the position is to be with the traffic commissioners outside the London area. The hon. Gentleman is now saying that the presumption should be changed, that good reason should be shown as to why it is in the public interest not to grant such a licence. There will be right of appeal if a commissioner gives a decision contrary to the person who makes the application and who does not accept the decision of that commissioner.<br><br>
The only difficulty here—and I presume it will apply to London Transport also—is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
the definition of public interest. Indeed, one of the reasons why we have an amendment down, which we shall come to later, is that the argument of the definition of public interest is fundamental to the Bill. It is as fundamental as this provision, because the definition of public interest under previous legislation is quite emphatic; it spells it out in a number of sections. The Bill seeks to remove those provisions that define public interest in the old legislation—I think sections 135 to 140—and then talk in the Bill of "public interest". But "public interest" is in no way adequately defined in the Bill.<br><br>
The difficulty now comes with London Transport, and the difference between us on the definition of "public interest" in the Bill is a matter for us to argue, either on clause 1, if the amendment is accepted, or at a later stage in the Bill.<br><br>
I want to direct the Minister's attention to the unique position of London Transport. As the Minister himself said, it is in a somewhat unique situation. We have left it to have its own separate legislation, and because it has, we have this special reason to introduce an appeal. That being so, it has a unique position as a kind of monopoly—I presume that would be the kind of argument put. It has some kind of monopoly power and, therefore, is judge and jury in its own situation. Parliament has always defined what "public interest" should be if we are giving so much power, as in this case, to a transport operator.<br><br>
Parliament has said that certain things shall not be done because they are considered to be against the public interest. Then we go on in that legislation to give definitions—as does the London Transport Act. One of our difficulties here is the reference back to other procedures—this Bill does it in this very clause. It states that if one reads in future the terms "public service vehicle" or "public service licence", it will mean in other pieces of legislation what this legislation says it means. Thus, the Bill has a consequential effect on other pieces of legislation.<br><br>
Our contention and argument about the old definition of public interest is that it will not apply in this case because now we are redefining it, although it is still not clear exactly what is meant. The Bill makes it clear what it is not, but is not very clear about what it is. What it is not is those sections that the Government are repealing in previous legislation. Presum-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
ably, any commissioner who has for a long time defined the public interest on the criteria spelled out in previous legislation will now feel that it is a new thing altogether.<br><br>
What is to be the new definition of public interest? I presume that there might be a commissioner who will look at the Bill and say, "What did Parliament mean when it said that I have to take into account the public interest? The Bill does not define it like the old rules that I had before in case law. It just means, make it easier." I think the example that the hon. Gentleman chose was clause 1(1)(<i>c</i>)—
<br><blockquote><p>"making it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences"</p></blockquote>
That is an open door to any kind of situation; just make it easier. That is hardly satisfactory if it is not defined in some way.<br><br>
Clearly, I am not going to have time to develop the case now, but I give some indication of my thinking to the Parliamentary Secretary. If we say that the London Transport Executive now can have an appeal against a decision, and it has made judgments on the public interest as defined in previous legislation, and we now change that situation, what will be the position of other sections in other Acts where duties are laid upon the Executive to provide a comprehensive transport network system? That is its duty under clause 1 of the Bill.<br><br>
It is the same problem for the county councils. They, too, have a duty and responsibility laid upon them in law to provide a comprehensive transport system. If the clause undermines that position, the proposition arises that other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
pieces of legislation should be amended in order to relieve them of that duty, because this Bill may well undermine it. That is certainly true in the case of the London Transport Executive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question of the relationship between what we are doing here and the 1969 Act, nothing we are doing will alter the general statutory responsibilities of the London Transport Executive as defined in the 1969 Act. In the 1969 Act, there is already provision for appeal to the Metropolitan traffic commissioners in the case of those people who operated services in London before 1969. The old-established operators have that right of appeal. The 1969 Act does not define any criteria for the commissioners to follow. All we are putting into our legislation is a similar right of appeal for all operators, that is, that new ones coming in now will have a similar right to that given to pre-1969 operators. That is the relationship between the two pieces of legislation, our Bill and the 1969 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the criteria which are to apply to the commissioners are to be found in other pieces of legislation. When the 1969 Act was drafted, the provision laid down that London Transport had both the duty to provide a service and the responsibility—</span></p>
