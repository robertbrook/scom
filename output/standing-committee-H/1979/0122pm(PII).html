	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 3, line 20, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'but shall not include any elements of profit'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is clear, and concerns a matter which the Committee has frequently debated. When considering what the aggregate amount of fares payment will cover, we note that the clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the running costs of a vehicle for a journey shall be taken to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
While many Opposition Members feel that there can be wide interpretation of what costs should be included in depreciation and general wear, the amendment seeks to make clear the Government's stated position, that is, the total amount of money given to the driver by car-sharing passengers must not allow for any profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the course of our debates it has become clear that although a surplus over and above normal charges may mean a profit—that is, more money than the actual costs involved—it may not necessarily mean, as I understand the matter and as courts have decided in certain cases, that by making a profit one is involved in a business. Therefore we are in some difficulty. To my simple mind, "profit"—which is a surplus over what are, in this instance, legitimate costs —always means a financial gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument seems now to have been refined to say that one can make a profit so long as that is not done regularly. When there is a similar route, that may be considered as a contributing factor to the definition of gain. Not being a lawyer, I do not know a great deal about case law—except for a reference in an earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
speech, and I am not sure where I picked that up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that courts, in defining hire and reward, have made a great many judgments that appear to have confirmed the point that the simple matter of profit—that is, a surplus over costs—does not necessarily mean that a business is being carried on. The amendment was drafted with the argument very much in mind that profit meant that a man was in business. Bearing that in mind, from the interpretations that have been made in our debates, the amendment is not entirely correct in seeking to strike out what we consider is the motive for conducting the business—namely, the securing of a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have told us that they still believe that anyone making charges—and we have been given indications of what may be reasonable charges—will be allowed to have them determined by magistrates' courts. They will decide whether a surplus that is made over and above what may be considered reasonable costs—that is for depreciation, general wear, petrol, and so on— constitute a profit and whether such profitable elements were sufficient to contribute to the definition of a business, which the Bill is designed to prevent occurring in respect of car sharing. We have the difficulty that, our amendment makes the principle clear in general but it does not state too clearly what is meant by the definition of profit. As I understand the matter, both sides of the Committee have agreed that we want to make clear to all those involved in car sharing that, while it may be possible to charge passengers an amount equal to the costs, it is not our intention that a profit should be made from the arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Bill's introduction, a great deal of time has been spent on explaining its purposes. There was some difference between us over whether Part I could be amended to include the Bill's purposes. The point was made that it would serve as an example to those who were seeking to make a judgment about what was intended in the various clauses of the Bill. Part of the argument was that those involved in making such a judgment could look at Part I for guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be interesting for the Government to consider—if not now, perhaps on Report—making a declaration in the Bill that there is no intention that those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
involved in car sharing should make a profit. As there is flexibility in the definition of profit, it does not necessarily mean that someone will be committing an offence if he makes a surplus in certain circumstances. It should be made clear that the Government do not intend that those sharing their cars and carrying passengers, and those who charge separate fares, should not make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts would then have sufficient grounds to define whether such a surplus was sufficient for them to make a judgment about profit, and whether there existed other factors that would contribute to defining whether a business was being carried. I refer to such things as whether the activity was regular or irregular, or a one-off occurrence, and whether all those matters are involved that will determine what is legitimate hire and reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment boils down to the Opposition giving the Government an opportunity, without tying matters down as firmly as we thought we had done when drafting it, to say that profit would mean a surplus. The Government were led to reconsider the matter of directions, which we discussed on earlier amendments. Therefore, we hope that the Government, even though they may not be able to adopt our amendment, will take an opportunity later to declare in the Bill that people should not make a profit as a result of offering to share their cars and by charging, as allowed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has pointed out, there is a clear need to specify in the Bill that no profit should be made under the car sharing arrangements. The need for that has increased since our amendment was tabled. Now that amendment No. 61 has been carried—and presumably the Government will also carry amendment No. 62 in due course—it is likely that the courts will be the only interpreters of this issue. We must therefore, examine the wording of clause 2(3) from that point of view. If matters are to be left to the courts, the wording is unfortunate. It states that the relevant costs will be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the running costs of a vehicle for a journey shall be taken to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
If matters are left there, we cannot have any confidence in the definition. In any
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
case, what is "an appropriate amount"? I hope that some hon. Members in the Committee with legal experience will give us the benefit of their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, would it be appropriate for a driver to make an arrangement which means that his passengers will contribute in full to the cost of depreciation of the vehicle during the journey, or would that be shared between the driver and passengers? At present, all that is left to the courts. Even if the amendment is carried, it might well be left to the courts to some degree. But at least the courts will be given guidance about the intentions of the House of Commons—that is, that there should not be included an element of profit. That is the least that we as a Committee can do to make the meaning clearer before we dispose of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that our wording keeps strictly within his stated intention as to how the provision is to be operated. As has previously been explained, that does not in any way prejudice our view of the great difficulty which we now face. Given the other wording here and the difficulty of interpretation, it is important that the intention—which is shared by both sides of the Committee—that car sharing should not involve any element of profit, is make clear in the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an amendment which, in many ways, I should like to accept. What has been said by the hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is entirely in line with our policy intention. We have already used, in general terms, words that indicate that we certainly would not wish people to make a profit out of car sharing. We are endeavouring to exclude from the protection of subsection (3) anyone who goes into business and thereby makes a profit out of what is, in effect, the business of hiring a car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to decide whether the inclusion of a specific reference in the terms to "elements of profit" would add anything to the Bill or whether it would introduce fresh complications. It appears that the addition of the phrase would add unnecessary complications without giving any advantage over the present wording. The difficulty arises because "profit" is an uncertain word. It means different things to different people. We all understand it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
to mean the surplus of revenue of some kind over costs of some kind. But in different circumstances it could be regarded in different ways, and historically the courts have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This can best be illustrated by reference to a volume entitled "Words and Phrases Legally Defined", to which lawyers occasionally resort as an aid to the interpretation of statutes. The book includes a section on profit. Pages 189 and 190 are entirely taken up with conflicting authorities about the meaning of the word profit when applied to a given legal situation. Someone complained about not having sufficient authorities, so I quote an 1895 authority. This is Bishop v. Smyrna and Cassaba Railway Company (1895) 2 Chancery Division, 265:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the word 'profits' like many other words in the English language, and even some of a technical character, is capable of more than one meaning, and it is often, and properly, used in more than one sense".</p></blockquote>
It goes on from there. There is also a case from 1911 concerning the Spanish Prospecting Company—(1911) 1 Chancery Division, 92—during which Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton launched into the optimistic words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the word 'profits' has in my opinion a well-defined legal meaning, and this meaning coincides with the fundamental conception of profits in general parlance".</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately he goes on to give a definition of profits which is not the same as that given in any of the other authorities on the two pages. It does not seem that he successfully resolved the problem thereafter, because the last authority quoted here is dated 1946. The word has given rise to endless difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to give rise to further debate, because one could start exchanging examples. However, quite apart from the history of difficulty in defining the word profit, it is conceivable that in the context of car sharing there could be real doubt about what is a profit. For instance, to return to the right hon. Gentleman's last amendment, if I have to make a journey at a certain time of day from my home to a certain destination, it could be argued that any contribution that I receive from a passenger is in a sense a profit. I shall incur all the expense of the journey in any event. Anything the passenger contributes therefore saves me money. Had we accepted the right hon. Gentleman's pre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
vious amendment, we should have been in considerable difficulty in deciding what profit was represented in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, introducing a reference to the word "profit" although, if we had a long enough debate the two sides of the Committee would probably decide on what they agreed was "profit"—will probably introduce confusion in the courts. I think we should ask ourselves "Do the words of the Bill adequately cover the situation that we want to cover"? What we have provided in the Bill is a measure, so far, that the total paid to the driver should not exceed the amount of the running costs of the vehicle for the journey, the running costs being taken to include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
That means that on a particular journey, whether a driver has to make it or not, he will not make a surplus, vis-a-vis the overall running costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that that is reasonably clear. To introduce profit as well is merely to give an alternative argument for someone arguing before a magistrates' court to latch on to, to try to say that what he was making did not amount to profit, or for a prosecutor to argue that it did amount to a profit. What we have here is more certain. It will be easier for a court to work upon than would be the case if we introduced the word "profit", as suggested by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to exclude people running a business. We do not want anybody to make money out of it, and we are seeking to protect those who do not make money out of it. What we have in the Bill will achieve that object more successfully than the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. May I attempt a somewhat more robust defence of profit than we have heard tonight from either side of the Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I condemn the incredible vehemence of some Labour Members over profit. Surely the nature of the Bill and the nature of all our objectives as presumably, Members of Parliament interested in promoting better transport—in particular for the poorer sectors of the community—means that we must look at all measures designed to improve transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
It strikes me as strange, therefore, that we are not prepared to accept that a profit motive is possibly a more effective means of encouraging more people towards car sharing than our present, apparently agreed position on a non-profitable arrangement. I will accept, if there is a Division on the point, that as a compromise to allow the Bill to proceed—and this Bill is a much better measure than any Bill I have seen—one has to accept such compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I would like to record clearly my unhappiness that profit in car sharing is not apparently an acceptable motive to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, and, I am sure, in other constituencies, there are problems, particularly in the industrial areas, where people have left their traditional homes and moved towards the country. In the towns and villages of north Warwickshire are living thousands of people who work for great industries in the Midlands. Those people have to get to work by one means or another. How do they do it? Do they come by bus? Later in the Bill we shall discuss the rural bus situation. But in the Midlands the decline of the bus has been quite marked. Do those people travel by their own cars?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is as much an important point that, in the big shire counties with big urban centres, such as Birmingham and Coventry, people find means of sharing cars, as it is that this happens in London. Much of the argument has become extremely introverted, tending towards the use of profit and the application to London. But it seems to me that if a man leaving from Lichfield, Tamworth, Coleshill, or anywhere in the Staffordshire and Warwickshire area to go to the big factories in Birmingham can share a car, he is doing as much good as a London commuter doing the same thing. If a man is allowed to make a profit he is, in my view, much more likely to offer his car to his friends because it is not just an intellectual argument. It is a practical argument. Getting up in the mornings and sharing this Committee Room at half-past Ten with fellow Members of Parliament may be exciting. Sharing a car with other people is not always as intellectually stimulating as sharing this room with Labour Members who have contributed in a splendid way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But sharing a car is sometimes a problem and people do not always want to do
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
it unless there is some little trigger. The trigger may be convenience or lack of alternatives. I suggest that it could well be profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken up the Committee's time and, having registered my protest, I would say that I have no doubt that the clause as presently drafted is completely acceptable. Just as one would, perhaps, like to see more basic changes to some of the later clauses in the Bill, one would like in future to see more allowance made for those sharing cars to make a profit. I think that the American experience has shown how more people move out of towns and than use car sharing to come back into their business life, particularly low-income families. I am talking about the ordinary working person. Everything that we can do to encourage car snaring is a vital element in saving energy, providing people with the means to go to work and giving them much more choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end with the comment that sharing cars seems to be far more of a Socialist than a Conservative measure. To have the freedom of choice to take one's own car and to go it alone is perhaps Conservative. It is strange that Socialist Members should oppose car sharing, when car sharing is a much more collective way of going to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of making my own Whip apoplectic, I want to make one or two comments. I agree with what my hon. Friend said in relation to the amendment. I do not think that it will help at all, but I want to make a point about the clause as it stands unamended. I believe that Opposition Members have a point in relation to the running costs argument. Clause 2(3) says that the running costs shall be taken
	<br><blockquote><p>"to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear".</p></blockquote>
Unless that excludes other elements, we shall be in some trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I have made privately to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, which I trust he has made privately to my right hon. Friend the Minister, is that I hope that they will consider incorporating, not necessarily now but perhaps at a later stage of the bill, a broad-brush clause which says precisely what is included in running costs. That may not be precise or altogether just and fair, but if we can say that depreciation and general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
wear are included. We might also include the point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis) and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), who made the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers should start looking at this point in preparation for Report, so that we have an exhaustive clause which sets out what is involved in running costs. I do not want to go to the lengths of enormous detail—philosophically I am against it—but if at least we could say which elements are included, individual people should be able to work out more or less what is involved in car sharing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members seem to think that the general public are half-witted. I do not think that. People are not that stupid. They will either go on public transport or join a car sharing arrangement because it is cheaper. They will be able to work it all out. But the Bill should state what elements of those running costs are included, and I urge such a clause upon my right hon. and hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It always puts me in something of a dilemma when I listen to arguments of the Parliamentary Secretary against Opposition amendments based on the difficulty of interpreting words. I draw two consolations. One is that possibly our ancestors had a better idea when they put their records down in the form of cave drawings or on tapestries. Secondly, I am led to the conclusion that perhaps there is some thing in the practice of modern economists in writing in figures and formulae rather than words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conventions of the House—I hope that I am not overawed by them—require us to table amendments in the form of words. If profit really is so hard to define—apparently the Parliamentary draftsman's textbook is not quite the same as that which engineering draftsmen use—the Minister owes us an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If profit really is so hard to define—apparently the Parliamentary draftsman's textbook is not quite the same as that which engineering draftsmen use—the Ministry owes us an explanation. I think that the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) appreciated the meaning of this part of subsection (3). If there is a difficulty in framing the Minister's meaning in words, that the car-sharing journey is not to make a profit, he should explain it to us in
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
response to my original question: what is meant by "an appropriate amount"? There is no definition in the Bill of "appropriate amount". Therefore, that is a matter which we should pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that has emerged from the debate is an argument about what the aims should be. I want to make it clear in response to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) that we do not object to people operating at a profit. If people can mount good services and make a profit from them, in many areas that is a useful contribution to maintaining a public transport system in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the purpose of the amendment or of the clause. It is on the Minister's aim that we are trying to draft the amendment. It was the Minister's aim that the car-sharing arrangements should be on a non-profitable basis. Successive decisions of Members of this House—I had understood up to now that on this point there was no break with consensus—have been that there should be a distinction in British law between those transport arrangements undertaken on a profitable basis and those undertaken on a non-profitable basis—or possibly, in the light of something that was said earlier in the Committee, I should say those which were intended to operate on a profitable basis. I recently went into an establishment which had on the wall a poster which said "This is a non-profit-making business. It was not intended to be, but it is just working out that way. "What we are talking about is are those who intend to operate at a profit.The courts would presumably judge whether a profit was being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason I must agree with the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port that it would be far better if we had a general guide as to the practice to be taken into account in determining what costs should be taken into consideration. It is particularly necessary if our amendment is rejected, but no doubt other hon. Members will have views on that and the Minister will want to give us the benefit of his view in words which I hope we shall interpret a little more generously than he does when considering Opposition amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) broadens the argument suddenly and dramatically by bringing the concept of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
profit-making into car sharing, which is interesting. On the Government side, and I gather from what has just been said on the Opposition side, there is no opposition to profit making in passenger transport. What we are talking about here is whether such transport needs to have an operator's licence or any kind of licensing control. The Bill as it stands adheres to the position that whatever form of passenger transport one provides, if one is in the business of providing transport one needs an operator's licence, and, for particular kinds of transport, other licences. Some of the established transport operators would perhaps have a legitimate complaint if new profit-making businesses in an area did not have licensing control when others did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Bill aims to open up passenger transport to new forms of profit-making, entrepreneurial business, however organised. As far as we have gone they will all need licences, perhaps unfortunately as it stands, if they are profit-making entrepreneurs. But we hope that the obstacles facing those attempting to provide new forms of transport in areas of the kind described by my hon. Friend will be very much less formidable once we have altered the powers of the traffic commissioners, the burden of proof and so on. Perhaps we should meet that point when we reach the relevant part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admire the flexibility of the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). The right hon. Gentleman promptly agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter), although what my hon. Friend had said bore not the slightest relationship to the arguments which the Opposition had been putting forward in support of their amendments for some considerable time.

My hon. Friend argued in support of a broad-brush definition. He did not espouse the regulations and charts of fares which we had been discussing. He questioned—understandably—whether in clause 2 as it stands we have adequately indicated the range of things that must be taken into account in calculating running costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons I have given, running costs are a more accurate guide than profit. I accept the strictures on legal lan-
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
guage but, even in non-legal language, it is easier to say what one means once than to try to say it a second time in different words. The right hon. Gentleman wants us to say, "You should not exceed the running costs", and then to say, "and you should not make a profit". He merely wants to say the same thing twice, but the chances are that, by trying to say the same thing in two different ways, he will produce an argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is better simply to say, "You should not exceed the amount of the running costs." However, in drafting the clause we felt it necessary to indicate that running costs should not be confined to the actual mechanical costs of running—oil, petrol and so on. We therefore included the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the running costs of a vehicle for a journey shall be taken to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the capital cost of the vehicle should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "an appropriate amount", which worries the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness, means an amount appropriate to that journey. We all know that the mileage allowance for Members of Parliament is far more than the cost of the petrol for the journey, as it is in the case of every other business mileage allowance. It includes an appropriate amount for the depreciation and general wear on the vehicle every time one adds some more miles to the clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port. Is it really adequate to mention only "depreciation and general wear" when one is really contemplating the other things that would ordinarily be taken into account for such purposes as a mileage allowance? The Government considered, for instance, an appropriate amount for insurance to be a cost properly attributable to a journey. In defence of the clause as it stands, I draw the Committee's attention to the word "include". Our intention was to give an indication of the sort of items that were to be included. The reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"depreciation and general wear and tear"</p></blockquote>
is not meant to be exhaustive, but I shall consider my hon. Friend's point that it might be a good idea to add one or two other obvious points to "depreciation and general wear" to make the meaning more clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
At the moment, I am advised that, whatever we do, we must retain the word "include". My right hon. Friend produced a quotation from Lord Denning, indicating that the moment one thinks one is launching on an exhaustive and closed list, sooner or later the variety of human life will throw up a situation in which, for instance, someone incurs a legitimate cost for his journey which was not thought of by this Committee. But if the indication in clause 2 is not adequate, we shall certainly consider whether it could be spelled out with more clarity and whether we should include a few more obvious examples of costs in order to give the courts the guidance that my hon. Friend, with his experience of advocacy, considers is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points that have been made in this debate have been repeated on various parts of the clause and different amendments. The hon. Gentleman summed up by referring to something said by Lord Denning. It may be true that one can create complications by trying to define too closely, and may perhaps not achieve one's objective, but we are nowhere near that situation in this legislation. We are simply trying to indicate what the possibilities may be if an offence is to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have agreed that, to make a profit by this action, "profit" could be defined in the broader sense as a contribution to a business, and a contributing factor to the definition of the action to be called a business activity, I must say that in that regard they have removed the deterrent, namely, that of giving directions that were in the earlier part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are difficulties in interpretation in case law, but the examples given by the Parliamentary Secretary began to show that, even in cases quoted as part of case law, they were not themselves clear as to what we interpret as profit. That, presumably, is in the case of the High Court, and we are only talking at the magistrate level, so God knows what will happen there. We are leaving it to the courts to decide, when it may have been better, as we did previously, to have left it to traffic commissioners to get an indication as to what the situation will be. That is one reason why we had traffic commissioners defining car sharing in our previous legislation. Whilst that can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
based to a certain extent on case law, it does not create the same difficulties, or the expense of pursuing an action through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was made clear by my right hon. Friend when it was raised by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills), rising to the defence of profit, whose arguments on the subject were as much directed to his own Front Bench as they were to Opposition Members. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, perhaps even more arguments ought to be made, because we were addressing our amendment to the Bill as defined by the Government, to which the hon. Gentleman gave support on Second Reading. In the definition of what may be considered profit, perhaps we can get over these difficulties about what will be considered to be the legitimate running costs. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary has made clear that one of the costs for consideration would be insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also received an assurance from the Government that the insurance companies feel that the normal provisions will apply to this kind of action. I am somewhat sceptical, as we are told that motor insurance does not make a profit, however it is defined, and is cross-subsidised by other forms of insurance. If it is agreed by the Government that car drivers in this situation can make a profit and can legitimately charge for extra insurance, the argument from the insurance industry will surely be, "You can claim this extra insurance from your charging procedures that you have in car sharing."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, that will give further impetus to an increase in the premiums. The insurance requirement will, inevitably, lead to a broad increase in the premiums for insurance which will apply both to non-car-sharing people and car-sharing people. There is a built-in incentive to that, which the Minister may welcome because non-sharing car owners may then purport to say "Perhaps I should get into this game and sell off the seats in my car." That may be the aim of the Minister. Inevitably, insurance costs will rise. The hon. Member for Meriden asked why we should be deprecating the motive of profit as such. If such an action is pursued solely for profit, there are other pieces of legislation that will apply. If a person is in the course of that business, he will either be private hire or a taxi car service. The clear intention of those who use their cars for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
that purpose is to pursue profit. It is a business exercise to achieve a profitable path by such an action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, clearly there is provision in the Bill to govern such people, though, presumably, the hon. Member for Meriden would soon begin to interpret what may be considered normal and abnormal profits. The normal business of a taxi will be considered, whatever that proportion is, as a normal profit
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are car sharing would be allowed to earn less than that and presumably the courts would have to define what the proportion of profit should be for a proper business and for those simply engaged in car sharing, which many of us feel would be a profitable enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although profit is difficult to define, it is clear that other Government Departments do it in connection with the use of cars. Particularly in the metropolitan area, it is determined what a taxi fare will be, and an element of running costs profit is taken into account. Presumably, in that instance, an idea of what legitimate charges should be is openly defined—although I do not know the proportions—and what surplus over and above them will be contribution to a fair profit earned by a taxi driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, matters are not unprecedented. The Government—not the Ministry of Transport but the Home Office—make such a definition. The difficulty is that the taxi driver does not accept that definition of profit; he argues</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>that it is an insufficient cover. There will always be debate—the Labour Government had the same problem—about what is a fair return and what is a profit.</p>
	<p>If the Ministry of Transport is in doubt about the matter, I refer it to the Home Office.</p>
	<p>Finally, I accept what was said by the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter), in whose constituency I received my education at a secondary modern school. Passengers will not be half-witted, and they will know which method of transport is cheaper. Anyone will be able to work out which form of transport—car-sharing, bus, train or taxi—will be cheapest. That is what concerns us. The provision will give rise to a transport system that is cheapest.</p>
	<p>To that extent, it will undermine the system, and therefore we feel that the profit element should be made clear. As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it is not the Government's intention that people should profit from such an arrangement. We wish to have a vote on the amendment, and hope that even if it is defeated the Government will—as they have indicated—reflect further on a more definitive explanation of a vehicle's running costs.</p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(6A)Notwithstanding anything in subsection (7), a motor vehicle used for providing transport in pursuance of arrangements made under subsection (1) of section 23 of the Education Act 1980—
	<ol>
	<li>if belonging to a local education authority, shall not for the purpose of this Part be treated as carrying passengers for hire or reward;</li>

by reason only of the carriage therein of a person who is required to pay a charge or fare by virtue of subsection (3) of that section provided that the arrangements for such charges or fares to be paid have received the written consent of the traffic commissioners for the area concerned, such consent only to be given when the traffic commissioners are satisfied that there are no other transport facilities which meet the reasonable needs of the pupils proposed to be carried under the powers contained in subsection (3) of that section.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 26 is a paving amendment to provide for amendment No. 38, which seeks to lay down conditions for the running of school buses on which fares can be charged in accordance with arrangements made by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in our law for the carriage of children to school, at fares or under the free provisions in education legislation, have developed considerably since the Education Act 1944. But even as long ago as that the House made a specific provision for transport facilities. Section 55 of the 1944 Act states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local education authority shall make such arrangements for the provision of transport and otherwise as they consider necessary or as the Minister may direct for the purpose of facilitating the attendance of pupils at schools or county colleges or at any course or class provided in pursuance of a scheme of further education in force for their area, and any transport provided in pursuance of such arrangements shall be provided free of charge... A local education authority may pay—"</p></blockquote>
the whole or any part as the authority thinks fit of—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the reasonable travelling expenses of any pupil in attendance at any school or county college or at any such course or class as aforesaid for whose transport no arrangements are made under this section."</p></blockquote>
The Education Act 1944 was clear in laying down the powers of education author-
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
ities to make provision for transport in so far as it made clear that they were to be engaged in providing free transport or subscribing towards the cost of people travelling on other transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After more than eight years of experience of that legislation, in the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1953 the House considered it advisable to be even more specific. During the intervening period a number of arrangements had been made by local authorities. No doubt by 1953 local authorities had made considerable representations to the Department of Education and the Ministry of Transport about how facilities for carrying children to school could best be co-ordinated with other transport services in their areas. The Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1953 contains the following statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this section, a local education authority shall have power, for the purpose of facilitating the attendance at any school or county college or at any course or class provided in pursuance of a scheme of further education in force for their area of pupils for whose transport free of charge no arrangements are made by the authority under subsection (1) of section fifty-five of the principal Act, to permit such pupils, in consideration of the payment to the authority of fares of such amounts as appear to them to be reasonable, to be carried in a motor vehicle used for providing transport in pursuance of the arrangement made under that subsection."</p></blockquote>
That provision is not fundamentally different from what appears in the 1944 Act. But section 12 of the 1953 Act continues, in terms not very different from those in the present Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) the powers conferred by this subsection on a local education authority shall not be exercisable by them in respect of any part of the route on which a vehicle runs in pursuance of any such arrangements, being a part outside the special area, except with the written consent of the licensing authority for public service vehicles in whose area that part of the route is situate, and shall not be exercisable by them in respect of any part of such a route being a part within the special area, except with the written consent both of the licensing authority for public service vehicles for that area and of the British Transport Commission".</p></blockquote>
Section 12 also provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) the licensing authority… shall not give their consent… unless they are satisfied that there are no other transport facilities which meet the reasonable needs of the pupils proposed to be carried in exercise of those powers."</p></blockquote>
I have quoted the existing legislation at some considerable length because it has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
shaped, to a very large extent, the bus services which operate throughout this country. There is at present a whole series of services which exist to provide transport of adults—and children not travelling in connection with their education—on scheduled services, and, simultaneously, to provide educational transport in accordance with arrangements agreed between the local authorities and the transport authorities or the bus companies of this area and also, of course, special transport services run by the local authority for those pupils for whom the authority provides free transport arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Education (No. 2) Bill there is a fundamental change in those arrangements. That Bill moves in exactly the opposite direction. In clause 23(3) of the Bill there is a provision that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local education authority—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) May make such charges as they think fit for any services provided under subsection (1) above, other than services provided for a pupil to whom subsection (5) below applies".</p></blockquote>
Clause 23(2) refers to a local authority's power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"pay the whole or any part, as the authority thinks fit, of the reasonable travelling expenses".</p></blockquote>
We are discussing a transport Bill at a time when the Government are making provisions in the Education (No. 2) Bill for education authorities to charge for travelling on their school buses. That is a very different arrangement. Simultaneously, the Government are omitting from legislation or withdrawing from previous education legislation—however one cares to interpret it—the requirement to consult the licensing authority for the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our belief, reinforced by our consultations with various bus operators, that this change will have a number of very serious consequences, highly detrimental to the maintenance of bus services in this country. A great many routes that provide the service of carrying children to school for fares depend for their viability on this service. If it is open to education authorities to decide, without any consultation with licensing authorities or bus companies, to run services for which they will charge and to run them over routes identical to those covered by other operators, one of two things can happen. The authority's charges can be set at a level which will enable it, for reasons that may make
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
sense in educational terms, to undermine the fare structure of other bus companies or the service can be run with similar fares without any regard to whether the other services can remain viable along those routes. Therefore, the amendment which we have tabled would not preclude the local education authority from seeking to make arrangements but would require it to do so with the written consent of traffic commissioners for the area. That could be given only when the traffic commissioners were satisfied that there were no other transport facilities to meet the reasonable needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements made by education authorities are many and legion. In some cases local authorities have contract arrangements with other operators if they move into this field. I leave it to the Committee to decide what those operators will do and I shall be interested to hear from Government Members what replies they have been given when they have consulted bus companies operating in their area. Up to now I have yet to find a bus company which is not bitterly opposed to this arrangement. They have varying opinions about other functions of licensing authorities or commissioners, but they seem to be unanimous that the only way in which one can have an intelligent integration of local education authority bus services with the public bus service system is if somebody, at least, can judge how the two can be worked harmoniously and decide whether it can make sense to allow an education authority to set about providing these services without any regard for their effect on the general public transport system of that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will realise the importance attached to this issue by the local authorities, by the education authorities who, as far as I can see, have not specifically asked for the power and by the bus companies who, so far as I can find out, have been unable to get a satisfactory explanation from the Minister as to why he should wish to proceed in this manner, I hope that he will give us an indication of what communications have been going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Minister goes to the Cabinet every Thursday morning, so we assume that he takes the opportunity to have a word with the Secretary of State for Education and Science about how they can sensibly co-ordinate their legislation. If they can sensibly co-ordinate the pro-

	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
visions of the Education (No. 2) Bill with those of this Bill, they will be able to do something which they have not yet explained to bus operators up and down the country or to public representatives outside the House. We wait with bated breath to see how they believe it can be possible to do something which the practical men in the field considers to be impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious issue on which the viability of a number of bus companies utterly depends and which deserves serious consideration by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has clearly explained that the purpose of his two amendments, taken together, is to retain in legal force the provisions at the moment contained in the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1953, which require the consent of the traffic commissioners before school bus services are authorised outside the road service licensing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman also rightly anticipated several times in his speech and in his concluding remarks, this is very much a matter for our colleagues on the Standing Committee considering the Education (No. 2) Bill. Clause 23 of that Bill replaces all the traffic provisions of the 1944 and 1953 Acts and clause 25 of that Bill includes similar provisions for Scotland. The Education (No. 2) Bill proposals greatly increase the discretion of local education authorities to charge for the provision of transport of pupils— which is a highly controversial matter for that Standing Committee—and remove the need for traffic commissioner consent for the operation of school bus services on which pupils are charged fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by taking up a point put to us by the right hon. Gentleman. I should be very interested to see whether the Labour Members on that other Standing Committee oppose the proposal to remove the traffic commissioner consent in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be very surprised if they do, because if they oppose that proposal they will be acting contrary to the interests of local authorities and also contrary to the interests of the parents of schoolchildren faced with the cost of getting their children to school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I deal first with the local authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
point? If one looks at the two Bills together, one can argue that this is very much a matter for the Committee considering the Education (No. 2) Bill. The traffic commissioners requirement is something of an anomaly, when one realises that the county council, in the case of the shire counties, is both the education and the transport authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities have the responsibility for school transport. They either own their own vehicles or have contract arrangements with operators, but they arrange school transport. At the same time they have their general statutory duty for transport planning in the county, which the Bill in no way undermines. The result is that two arms of the same county council are responsible for looking after the interests or schoolchildren and parents as well as the interests of the network of buses and so on in the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system, which the right hon. Gentleman wishes to retain, has interposed as an arbiter between the two wings of the local county council the traffic commissioners, who exercise a very theoretical supervisory role. It is the present intention of the Government to remove unnecessary shackles, bureaucratic constraints and unnecessary procedures from local government. We believe that local government should have clearly defined responsibilities and should be allowed to get on with them in the interests of their electors. It is absurd that two committees and one local authority come to arrangements between themselves which then have to be submitted to an outside body, the traffic commissioners, to make sure that they are co-ordinating them properly. One can therefore eliminate this unnecessary requirement, which is a worthwhile simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touch on a further point. Not only is it in the interests of local authorities to get rid of this rather odd arrangement whereby the traffic commissioners are interposed right in the middle of something which, as a matter of law, should be sorted out by the local authority, but it is against the interests of school parents. I do not want to tread on to the debate which will take place on the Education (No. 2) Bill. Everybody on this Committee could express views about the very controversial matter of charging for school transport and the costs of school transport. It is not our province; it is quite
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
outside the field of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the one thing that I should have thought members of this Committee would have been interested in is anything which encourages the economical provision of school transport. We are interested in keeping down the basic costs of school transport. We do not want the traffic commissioners intervening, causing delay and providing new services. We do not want the traffic commissioners cutting out services which the local authority wants to provide. Whatever else comes out of the education legislation, it is in everybody's interest that the costs of providing educational transport are kept to the minimun. That is why the Education (No. 2) Bill contains the provisions it does. That is why we should all be in favour of the most flexible arrangements for school transport that can be devised, so that the basic cost of providing it can be kept to the minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has come in with very special pleading on the part of bus operators who have made these representations to him. They are being ultra cautious. I understand their position, but, with respect, he was reading a brief provided to him by one of the major bus companies. We must look at this subject in the round, as we should as Members of this House, and consider the problem of keeping school transport costs to a minimum. In the debate that is going on between local education authorities, parents and others, if someone gets up and says "What about the interests of the National Bus Company? We should stop cheap school transport being provided unless the traffic commissioners agree that it will not harm the interests of the bus operators.", such remarks would not be regarded as a very useful contribution to the debate. All that we are doing is removing an anomaly which should not be there in the first place, and it is a very inappropriate time at which to remove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as I said, it is a matter which should be left to the Education (No. 2) Bill Committee. I have no doubt of the conclusion that will be reached by the educationists in that Committee and those interested in the low cost of school transport and the interests of parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, my point is that, whoever has been responsible for the law in the past, we are responsible for the law in the future, and I cannot justify to anyone—parent, child, or anyone who is not a parent—the exclusion of vehicles from the need for road service licences and public service vehicle licences simply because they carry schoolchildren. Road service licensing, and public service vehicle licensing, is there to enhance the safety of passengers, and the safety of schoolchildren is just as important as the safety of fare paying adult passengers. If we pass the clause as it stands, or accept my right hon. Friend's amendment we shall be allowing local authorities, if they own their own vehicles and charge fares, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
carry schoolchildren in vehicles which are not subjected to the rigours of the public service vehicle licensing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not, therefore, be supporting my right hon. Friend's second amendment because I will not vote now, or at any other stage, for any provision which derogates from the safety provisions relating to public service vehicles where children are concerned. I urge the Committee to do likewise. There is no justification for applying a lower standard of safety and control to vehicles which carry schoolchildren from those which carry anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to be brief, as it is a simple matter. There is no justification other than cost. But no one can plead that the cost of maintaining the safety of vehicles which carry schoolchildren is of paramount importance, any more than the cost of maintaining the safety regulations which apply to all other vehicles is more important than safety. There is no logic in singling out children. The only logic is the intention that people could keep down the cost of ferrying schoolchildren about. There is no justification for that. I will not support that or, therefore, my right hon. Friend's amendment. I appreciate the reasons behind the amendment, but they are all paved, as he would say, on the fundamental basis that there should be a lower and different standard of safety for school buses compared with other buses. I cannot understand how anyone can vote for that, and I have no intention of doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to some parts of the argument it boils down to whether the commissioner should have any say in the provision of school buses. The Education (No. 2) Bill now being considered in Committee takes that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary wondered whether hon. Members on the Committee would oppose commissioners being involved. That is a matter of judgment. I should have thought it would be wiser to retain the commissioners' controls than to reduce them, for the very good reason of public interest, and his interpretation of it in the application of buses carrying schoolchildren on routes, with the possibility of fare paying passengers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an inquiry of my right hon. Friend as to whether we have discussed this with the Secretary of State for Edu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
cation, to which the answer is "Yes". When we asked the Opposition whether they had discussed this with their colleagues on the Education (No. 2) Bill Committee, the answer we received was "No", because it is being said that the hon. Gentleman would suppose they would take this view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From talking to our colleagues on the Education (No. 2) Bill Committee we are aware that these two clauses are relevant to each other. We have a general understanding on that. I have not specifically asked what the direct policy will be on that matter. I have presumed, up to this stage, that the whole role of traffic commissioners in determining licensing control, in the way that we have considered it in all legislation since 1930, should be upheld in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (No. 2) Bill Committee has not yet reached that stage, and we are looking at the fuller implications of that part of it. But there is one matter they will have to consider, which is made clear in the Government's notes on clauses. In certain circumstances, as was also the case in previous legislation, charges can be made on certain buses provided by local education authorities or by buses provided under contract. I thought that somewhere the notes referred to the precedent of actually charging for other school children who may be travelling in the bus but are inside the radius which defines where free transport or fare paying transport is provided. Therefore, the actual payment of fare for being carried on the school buses, as a principle, has already been acknowledged, as I understand it, for those children who are inside the radius and do not qualify for free transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, what causes considerably more concern, apart from the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr.Dobson) about the definition of safety and the controls of licensing, is what would be the position of contract companies, which are by far the greatest providers of buses to education authorities for this service —some of them private, but in my area many of them belong to local authorities. Will they, on the same route, have the possibility of charging passengers? That certainly seems to be the concern of a number of bus companies which have spoken to us about the consequences of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
part of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be placed on record that when my right hon. Friend was dealing with what became known as the brief of the National Bus Company, there was a letter from that company which included references solely to the Education Act 1944, the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1953 and the Education (No. 2) Bill 1979. In fact, it was not really a brief at all. Indeed, one might think that it had been provided by the Library, but it resulted from a conversation between my right hon. Friend and representatives of the National Bus Company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is an important point that concerns bus companies. They point out that transport is provided for schoolchildren—particularly in areas such as mine, where the transport authority, Hull corporation, provides under a contract with the education authority, which in this case is the county—at peak periods. If the growth of private contractual arrangements led to a service being provided for fare-paying passengers on the same route, that would considerably undermine the economy of the bus company involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the opposition of the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), who was strongly against the principle of cross-subsidisation, it becomes clear that for bus companies to operate a bus transport system—particularly in such areas as North Yorkshire; that point was made earlier by the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: West Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Particularly in those areas that principle is very strong. The same argument applies with regard to school buses. There could be buses that are only half filled by children and buses with fare-paying passengers on the same route. That is one of the reasons why the commissioners were given the responsibility, with the public interest in mind, not to duplicate existing facilities. Those are the sort of provisions that are to be repealed by the Government in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When those fears are taken together, bus companies feel that it is the thin end of the wedge, which will eventually lead to an alternative service being provided, perhaps by private contractors against
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
municipal undertakings—or even by the National Bus Company if it wanted to compete with a local authority in the provision of school transport. That would lead to duplication of services and perhaps to a reduction of the number of buses to a level which would not be sufficient to carry out an adequate and integrated public transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the clause, while it may not be as potent in its effect as it appears at present, has caused considerable anxiety. I should be grateful if the Minister would give us an indication of the position in respect of fare-paying passengers on school buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am accused by the Minister of moving Labour Party policy a long way to the Left, and by one of my hon. Friend's of being moderate. I must bear the remark of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) with as much equinimity as I can muster. However, I do not have to take that suggestion from the Minister, when I am defending a provision that has been developed in our legislation over a considerable number of years, as I have tried to show. If anything, I am defending the status quo and it is the Minister and his Government who in this instance are moving on policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say how far the Government are moving to the right; that is something that they must judge for themselves. Of course, I object to the suggestion that I am reading from a brief of the National Bus Company. I discussed the matter with that company and asked it—quite properly—to let me see copies of the leglislation under which it was operating and the provisions of the Education Acts that it believed to be relevant. That is precisely what it did and those were the documents from which I quoted. However, that is not the only body that I have consulted on the matter. The Minister says that the Bill does not undermine the transport planning functions of local authorities. Nevertheless, I believe that what he is doing in the Bill does not comprise the total extent of that undermining. The way in which he is doing that extends way beyond the provisions of this Bill—which, incidentally, cut into those transport planning functions by taking I certain aspects of planning out of the hands of those to whom local authorities t can make representations about their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister is engaged at present in arrangements for transport supplementary grant which are making it well-nigh impossible for certain local authorities to discharge their transport planning duties in the way that they would like. That was made crystal clear to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and myself in our recent discussions with officers and elected members of the Tyne and Wear authority. The issue of transport planning function is involved in the matter. I shall come to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said, quite properly, that it should be the concern of Members of Parliament to keep the cost of providing school transport to a minimum, and I agree with him. We should ensure that nothing that we do in this Bill or in any other legislation will impose on local authorities—or on other operators, for that matter—difficulties and burdens in the way of providing of adequate school transport as economically as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if—as is the case under the combination of this Bill and the Education (No. 2) Bill that is at present going through the House—there is a duplication of services on routes, and a school bus travels along the same route as one with fare-paying passengers; there may even be fare-paying pupils—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.53 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was suggesting that the Minister's objection to these amendments is hardly consistent with his contention that we should give some plurality in this matter to keeping the costs of providing school transport at a minimum. I believe that if the Education Bill and the Transport Bill go through in their present form, there will be a serious danger of duplication on groups which, at present, are adequately served by buses which take fare-paying pupils and in some cases non-fare paying pupils by a subsidy arrangement between local authority and bus company. In their place there will be duplicate services which will undermine the viability or, if they do not undermine viability, will lead, of course, to higher
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
costs in order that two services can be sustained on a route where only one is required now to provide the service. I contend that it is not reasonable, with the aim of keeping the cost of conveying children to school to the minimum, to press ahead with the arrangements of the Education (No. 2) Bill under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister should be a little wary of attracting the cheers of his Back Benchers with propositions that, in fact, anything which cuts down the power of licensing authorities or traffic commissioners is something to be delighted with. This pathological hatred, which seems to have grown in the Conservative Party, of the licensing authorities, and which is being fostered by the Minister might happen to suit him at this stage. But he would do well to recall that he is going to require the same Members to support him when he comes to the part of the Bill that deals with stage carriage operations, in which he defines a resolve for the traffic commissioners and licensing authorities upon whom he now pours contempt and suggests are anaethema to his friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister will have to change his tune. I know, of course, that the Parliamentary Secretary can be flexible, as he was earlier tonight when he accused me of being extremely flexible. He pointed out to me that it was far better to define things with one set of words instead of a repetition—almost the reverse of the argument he used to oppose an amendment I put down at an earlier part of the same clause. So there is no monopoly of flexibility on either side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I think it almost naive of the Parliamentary Secretary to suggest that we can do away with the role of the commissioners or the licensing authorities in this area, because here, of course, the education authority is a local authority and the county or the metropolitan authority is a planning authority, sane people elected by sane constituents. They would, therefore, be able to work out, as he suggests—I take it that this is what he is implying—a very suitable arrangement between themselves whereby the people who are on the transport committee will be able to say to those on the education committee "Do not duplicate on that service, as that will be detrimental to our transport plans and will militate against our transport planning function". The Parliamentary Secretary knows probably better than anybody else on his side of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
Committee the extent to which local authorities are inhibited on two counts in the carrying out of their transport planning functions. This is not necessarily a criticism of him or of his Government. It was true under the Labour Government. It was inevitable in the way in which the transport support grant arrangements were made and, therefore, the way in which the transport planning functions of the local planning authorities could be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand, the authorities referred to here had to negotiate with the Minister and his Department as to what financing arrangements could be reached to carry out what they considered to be required for the best interests of developing local public transport in their areas. That is the first constriction upon them, or the way in which they are circumscribed in carrying out their planning function according to their own position. Secondly, they have had to negotiate with the public transport operators who operate in their areas to see how far those operators will carry out the services which they think are necessary in the public interest on the money which the Minister will allow them to spend in rate support grant and, of course, what they are prepared to raise from their electors. But those two constraints apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the local authorities are not the agents in this matter and, therefore, Parliament has decided previously that it is better referred to the quasi-judicial authority of a licensing authority which will have specific criteria laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the quangos are anaethema to a degree, along with our licensing authorities or traffic commissioners. But these are bodies set up by Parliament with specific duties and functions to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been trying to examine over recent months how they carry them out. We will come to that later in the Bill. I can see no general evidence that they have not carried out the duty which Parliament has laid upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members opposite want to complain that traffic commissioners have not been carrying out their duties, they could do it far more constructively by suggesting how the duty would be better carried out, or why there should be no such duties. If they want this to be a complete free-for-
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
all, if they want this situation to be catch-as-can, if they want education authorities to say "How can we provide for the transport of children as cheaply as possible within our education budget without any regard to the longer term costs of doing so, without any regard for how much more difficult it would be if part of the transport system in our area collapsed because what we were doing militated against the transport planning functions of the authority, of which we are members," I take it that they will be 100 per cent behind their Minister in his attitude. But if they have seriously consulted those who operate bus services in their areas, whether they be public or private, they will have received the same view, if they have consulted seriously with district as well as with county authorities about the extent to which it is possible to mount the ideal transport plan for the area, and the extent to which they are dependent upon having commissioners, or having some authority which has its specific and sole responsibility judging transport proposals against the public interest as defined by Parliament, I think they will take a different view from the rather glib view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary tonight. They will then realise that there is a lot in the argument of those who say that if we are to maintain the widest possible range of public transport services, particularly bus services, we must utilise some efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are seats going on those buses, which could be used effectively to take children to school and thereby make a contribution to cost and maintaining the services, that is a more intelligent arrangement than inviting people to duplicate on the service in a way that has no regard for the overall consideration of what is in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what underlies this matter, and that is why I have sympathy with the point raised by my hon. Friend concerning the extent to which the licensing function in respect of those who carry school children should be as great as those who operate anywhere else in the public transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not conflict with the argument I now make. What I am arguing cannot lead to a smaller number of children being carried in vehicles. It may well, in fact, lead to many more being carried in vehicles, subject to public service vehicle licensing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have that argument with my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
Friend as to the other effect of his remarks outside the Committee. He and I are at one in the proposition that we need someone in a position to judge what is in the public interests, to avoid unnecessary duplication of services and the wrecking of very delicately balanced arrangements made by a whole combination of considerations of education committees of local authorities, and of the Ministry of Transport in the allocation of transport support grant, bus companies and traffic commissioners. One can wreck a complex and detailed arrangement by this Bill, for which we may pay dearly later as regards maintaining not only the transport of children to school in an economical way, a way which saves public funds, but by acting against the maintenance of our public transport systems in the way that would be desired by the elected local authority members, who seek in very difficult circumstances to carry out the transport planning function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I withdraw the suggestion that I made earlier that the right hon. Gentleman had read a brief from the National Bus Company. I accept, of course, what his hon. Friend said about the documents in front of him. I also see that there is nothing on them but the text of the legislation, which is rather complex in this area. We are all sitting surrounded by briefing material of all kinds, including the text of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I still argue that the right hon. Gentleman? argued strongly from the point of view of the transport operators and has not considered the matter in the wider context, including the transport operators' interests, of course, as well as the interests of parents, local education authorities, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's main point was about the need for traffic commissioners. What he described as a delicate balance became increasingly complex as he described it. It is a very complex arrangement, which we are trying to simplify in this legislation. He is trying to return to the 1953 legislation. He says that Parliament always accepted it in the past and that it is well tried. But there has been an important change since 1953. The county councils and metropolitan county councils now have a transport plan function. They did not have that function in 1953.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation now is that in entire coun-
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
ties, on the same authority—the county council—is the education and transport planning authority. In the metropolitan districts, the metropolitan county is the transport authority, and the districts are the education authority. But in all cases it is elected authorities which now have both responsibilities, and it therefore seems to us wrong—given that the elected and responsible authorities have to weigh up the competing interests of the transport network on the one hand and the interests of parents and schools in cheap transport to school on the other—that the non-elected traffic commissioners should still play a role and that their consent should be required to what is entirely a local authority responsibility. That is the point that I sought to make and I do not believe that it is easily answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only fresh argument that the right hon. Gentleman brought to bear was that somehow there were difficulties for local authorities in carrying out their transport planning functions, but he is only referring to the constant problems of funds. I do not accept for example that they are starving of funds and therefore cannot carry out their transport planning functions. I could quote some local authorities—I shall not do so at this hour—where we are actually increasing the funds available from central Government for revenue support for their bus services. But the more that authorities are constrained, as we are all constrained to some extent, in the available funds for transport planning, by the present financial climate, the more they will be anxious to avoid wasteful duplication of services, and so on, because they will probably have to step in with revenue support to compensate if damage is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we can leave to county councils, because of their transport planning functions, the cross-subsidisation arguments and so on, which also exercise the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). There is a delicate balance to be struck but that balance can be struck by local authorities. I do not believe that, in the present context, it is right to intervene with the narrow interests of bus operators alone, which apparently the Opposition want to defend with the Traffic Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A quite separate point was made by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson)? I do not want to widen the gulf between him and his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
hon. and right hon. Friends with whom he is still sitting happily. But I thought he was on to a slightly more substantial point and one which had been considered before we came forward with the Bill. It is the case that the safety and other licensing requirements for the transport of school children differ from those for other passengers. At first sight, it is rather extraordinary that the licensing and safety requirements are more relaxed in the case of the transport of school children than they are for adults. However, that again is a situation which Parliament and everyone else has tolerated for a very long time, and it is not quite so bad on examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the vehicle is local authority owned—there are only 900 of them—and where it is being used for the purpose of school transport alone—I paraphrase the legislation—it is not a public service vehicle. That is a very wide exemption indeed. It takes such vehicles outside the operators' licence requirements, vehicle inspections, and so on. Although it appears at first blush to be a strange position, it is, I believe, defensible. First, these are elected and responsible local authorities. They are free from controls, the main target for control is the cowboy, the small coach operator. Here is a big contrast. These vehicles are owned by responsible local authorities and, when one thinks about it, there is no serious risk that an elected local authority will put its school children in dangerous buses owned by itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is thought to be a risky assertion, the position has never, as far as I am aware, given rise to any difficulty whatsoever and there has never been an accident—I am tempting fate by saying "never", but I am not aware of an accident—in which a school vehicle owned by a local education authority has been involved because of a safety defect in the vehicle. Certainly, one cannot guarantee that it will never happen in a local authority—one can never say "never" in this world as there is human error on the part of the mechanics, and so on—but local authorities obviously strive to keep their school buses in good mechanical condition. That is why they have this exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of vehicles contracted to LEAs—they are by far the bulk of the vehicles—the only easing of the law is that, although there may be fare-paying
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
children on them, they are regarded as contract carriage and not stage carriage for the purpose of the legislation. That does not, of course, take them out of operator licensing. They are public service vehicles and the safety requirements are therefore met. They are not in the same category and as I say, have given rise to no problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras that, given that the system has worked perfectly well so far—this apparent anomaly has given rise to no problems—this is not the right time suddenly to decide, for the sake of tidiness or completeness, to bring those vehicles into line with other operators, because the effect inevitably will be to raise the cost of providing that school transport. There is no evidence to justify change—no history of trouble, no sign that they need vehicle inspections, operators' licences or PSV drivers and all the rest. If one suddenly made all the local authorities running school buses come within this system, one would, at a very inappropriate time, be putting up the costs of the school transport all over the country, and I do not think that our electors would thank us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned about this fare-paying passenger. It is an argument which arises later but I should like to get it clear in my mind. An education authority having a bus on contract, finding that the bus was running only half full between A and B, and also providing a service for fare-paying passengers, would be in a stage carriage situation—the Parliamentary Secretary has made that clear—and therefore would have to apply for a licence. Presumably this contract hire person could then apply to the commissioner requesting a licence to continue a stage carriage service between points A and B. The only thing that prevents him from doing that now is to say "You cannot do it without permission but if you apply to the traffic commissioner he will give you permission". If that is true, the traffic commissioner now has the guidance of this legislation, whereby no longer has he necessarily to take duplication into account and the general interest of the balance of transport, which was the consideration under the old definition of public interest. He now has to show good reason why he should not, and furthermore should take into account what the local authority is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
If the local authority is being informed by the contract hire person that if he could do this he would charge less to its education service, the local authority is reasonable in saying to the commissioner "Please allow him to do this as it is in our interest". Therefore, it would be possible that an operator of what was normally an education service, albeit half full, could apply to the commissioner under more lax conditions for a licence to provide a stage carriage service between A and B. That is the concern of a number of operators. Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that it is a possibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the case that someone with a half empty "education bus"—if I may so describe a bus provided under the 1953 Act—may choose so to fill up the other places that he requires to go to the commissioners for a licence. He may still have to do so under the Bill. If he does that, he will of course be applying under the same criteria as any other new applicant under our Bill, which we shall debate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the law stands, he will not need to do that if he has fare-paying children on board the bus together with the free children. If it is local authority-owned, he does not need to bother. If he is a contractor, his fare-paying children simply</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I conclude by saying that I welcome the one point of agreement that emerged between us—it was made heavily by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth)—that we must not exhaust the possibilities of looking for ways to reduce the cost of education transport. We are, I gather, agreed about the need to keep down the cost of education transport. The fact remains that the present arrangements, which are more flexible for school buses than for other buses, have given rise to no danger and no difficulties, and have kept the cost down. We do not close our minds to the possibility of keeping down the cost of school buses in present circumstances, and we strongly resist amendments of this kind, which we believe would have the effect of putting those costs up.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for your guidance, Mr. Dean. The Opposition take your point about reiteration, in a debate on clause stand part, points that have been made in earlier debates. Perhaps a debate on clause stand part, on this occasion—as we have had considerable debate about the detail of the clause—should serve the major purpose of attempting at least to put on record a certain confusion in the earlier debates. This has appeared particularly on the part of the Government spokesmen, who have made clear that, as they saw it, the clause was doing little more than extending legislation enacted by a previous Labour Government
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was also the suggestion that the view at present put forward by the Opposition tended to reflect the political persuasion of myself and my right hon. Friend. I do not think that that is so, and indeed it is a matter of record that one can make the comparison. We have supported the principles embodied in previous legislation which clause 2 seeks to change. Those differences between the provisions are considerable, especially in regard to the definition of a public service vehicle, on which we have had some interpretation and debate, and on which we shall have considerably more debate when we come to the other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a public service vehicle, with all the standards that one associates with it—safety, control by the commissioners and the possible requirement for a licence to operate a passenger-carrying service—has been made much narrower by the clause. We shall not argue whether the increase in the maximum number of passengers from seven to eight is a major step forward. But it is significant, as we have tried to show, in relation to car sharing capacity with which the clause deals, though the Minister made clear in the debate that the change to eight was mainly for the purpose of harmonising with the EEC. It has the attraction, too, of moving to a larger car for car sharing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made clear in the debate our differences in the approach to the idea of a public service vehicle. It is mainly in the definition of vehicles to be used for hire or reward in clause 2(1) that one begins to see the major difference between the two sides over their philosophical approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been agreed that the principle of car sharing was embodied in the 1978 Act introduced by a Labour Government. As
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
we have tried to make clear, we hedged it in with certain controls. I suppose that, to some extent, that reflected a rather suspicious attitude to car sharing. We believe that it constitutes a threat of some kind to maintenance of an integrated public transport system, in which we believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is this fundamental difference in philosophy about transport which came out on Second Reading. In the Bill the Minister is set on reducing many of the controls, and clause 2 is involved in that. It is envisaged that the car sharing provision, in which the Minister has great faith, will now be much easier to operate —indeed, even at a profit. When the debate started, the Opposition assumed that profit meant a surplus. Now it is seen that this can be a profitable situation under such a limited interpretation—one can make money by the action of sharing one's car. It will be at a price lower than a taxi, bus or rail, which are the alternative forms of transport, and therefore the profit motive which we have talked about will be very evident to the passenger seeking to choose between alternative forms of transport. The person providing the car transport will find it a profitable exercise for him because of the charges that he will be able to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if he is charging in excess of what the Minister may consider to be the appropriate cost—and there is some doubt about that—there will be no means of enforcing a check. This will lead to a considerable threat to the legitimate taxi business, which we are concerned to maintain. We impose on taxi hire, because it is a profitable business, certain controls—on the building of the taxi, on the service that is used, on the quality of the driver both in terms of medical fitness and knowledge. We consider it right to impose those conditions on those who seek to use their cars in a business operation, however that is defined. In the case of a taxi applying for a licence, conditions as to costs, profits, prices and the state of the vehicle are stringently laid down by the Government authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any doubt at all, I refer hon. Members to the 1978 Act. In that piece of legislation we agreed that car sharing should be permitted. As the Minister pointed out, licensing was also to be allowed. But we were very specific about the means of advertisement that were permissible. We made it clear that only notices about journeys to be made to or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
from the place of work should be displayed at the place of work. We also made clear that only notices relating to journeys arranged incidentally in connection with the activities of a club or voluntary association could be displayed in that club or the premises of that voluntary association. We permitted the advertisement to be printed in the periodicals of a particular club or association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is distinctly different from the idea that advertisements should be readily available at the newsagent's, they may be seen by any stranger or anyone who had decided to travel from A to B, and not just by people with the motives which have normally been given as the justification for car sharing, namely that they were going to the same place of work or sharing the same social function. The interpretation of the use of car sharing in this Bill is much broader. To be fair, the Minister claims that that is so. But we have made it clear, as we did in schedule 1 to the 1978 Act, which is relevant to the subsections of clause 2 which we have been discussing, and which is now to be repealed and replaced by a new schedule, that car sharing on social occasions might be advertised. Moreover, the local authorities or the traffic commissioners would make sure that the advertisement did not have a commercial purpose and that there was no view to making a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We used the traffic commissioners as a means of assessing how the definition of profit should be used, or whether our car sharing provision, which allowed for advertisements in a club magazine, for instance, or in the church hall, was being used for profit or for social provision as was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were other controls in the 1978 Act. It should be quite clear that our approach to car sharing was very different. It is the Government's criticism that we are wedded to regulations and controls. It is noticeable, however, that the Minister will have to rely on the same kind of bodies, which are not being legislated out of existence. Indeed, the Bill imposes another level of commissioner for London. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the Government are not rejecting the commissioner principle. Indeed, the Government lean heavily upon that principle as a control, particularly in the stage areas. We are not getting rid of a level of administration; we are merely cutting off some of its functions. We felt that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
commissioners had an important function—to make sure that the car sharing principle would not be used as a means of exploiting passengers and undermining the existing taxi and private car arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would go considerably further and say that there is a certain amount of evidence, reflected in the anxiety of those who provide public transport systems, that it may also contribute to undermining the integration of a public transport system which at the moment is very much wedded to the concept of cross-subsidisation. I have noted that that concept is being rejected by some hon. Members although I do not think that it has been rejected by Conservative Front Bench spokesmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a distinct difference between the Labour and Conservative views, not perhaps on the principle of car sharing but certainly on the application and the wider use of it dealt with in clause 2, and that is why we oppose clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have gathered already that when faced with any proposal from the Government, the Opposition either denounce it in the wildest terms as being likely to have the most extreme and terrible effects or say that it is such a trivial bit of rubbish that it will make no difference at all. I find myself in that quandary when considering clause 2. I trust that all honest persons present will agree that they have found themselves in that position in the past. Nevertheless, I should like to turn to one particular aspect of clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman ought to tell us what conclusion he reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it to the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to discern, with all the wit at their disposal. But I am not sure about my views on this topic, and no one else should be sure, because they have no evidence on which to come to a firm conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been blandly assumed by Conservative Members, including the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary —more particularly the Minister, according to the impression I have received—that car sharing is good; that it will save road space; that it will save energy and that it will be altogether an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
improvement for the people concerned. I have tried as best I can—I do not have the resources of the Department at my disposal—to find out what assessments have been made of the impact of car sharing on any aspects of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may reach for something which is unpublished—in which case he has an advantage over the Opposition —but I can rely only on published documents, even if they have been published by offshoots of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport. I refer in particular to the TRRL report 893 published only last year. I shall quote three paragraphs from it, if you will bear with me, Mr. Dean. The first paragraph in the summary of the study of car sharing and car pooling in Britain says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Car-poolers (drivers who take turns to drive their own car and give lifts to the others in the group) form a small proportion of car drivers travelling to work, about 3 per cent."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most people who travel to work in non-household cars"</p></blockquote>
by which they mean cars not belonging to any member of their household—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are therefore regular passengers... and most do not have the option of driving themselves; 	<i>drivers</i> who voluntarily forgo the use of their own car and choose to be regular passengers are estimated to number as few or fewer than poolers."</p></blockquote>
If people do not have cars and they are encouraged by this legislation, or anything else, to travel by car, they are likely to cease travelling by public transport. It may well be, therefore, that there will be a reduction in the use of public transport and there may be an increase in vehicles on already crowded roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither of those possibilities are energy saving. I am not asserting that that is the case. I am saying that the studies issued by the Department suggest that that is the more likely outcome. The report goes on to say—and this is equally important
	<br><blockquote><p>"Following the 1978 Transport Act which relaxes the law on lift-giving, a number of car-sharing and car-pooling schemes are being planned. Monitoring of these should help to quantify the effects of publicity and the provision of a matching service for potential partners."</p></blockquote>
That sounds like some sort of dating bureau, but is is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
I should like to know whether the Minister has any more up-to-date information about the effects of car sharing. We heard about the effects of car sharing in the United States and I got the TRRL supplementary report on that topic. That literally comes to no conclusion. It is a most wondrous document, probably best not issued by the Department at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But is seems that there is no clear evidence one way or another on the effect of car-sharing on energy, or car use, or public transport in the United States. In the circumstances it is unfortunate, to say the least, that Ministers are asserting that car sharing is a wholly good thing, and a step in the right direction. That does not necessarily follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further point that I ought to make. It is not mentioned in either of the reports, the one Britain—which is rather more readable—or the one on the United States. There is no mention of the effects on safety. It is a fact that one is safer travelling by bus, taxi or train than by private car. I exhort the Minister to ensure that when monitoring the effects of car sharing, his Department includes in their cost benefit analysis equation the effects and costs of increased car sharing on the accident rate of both cars and passengers. I hope that I have made clear to Tory Members that I cannot assert one way or the other whether car sharing is a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassert that I could not possibly support clause 2 while it provides for a lower level of safety supervision for coaches and buses that carry children. The Parliamentary Secretary does not usually say silly things, but it was silly of him to say that, because they are elected representatives, we can rely on the education authorities which own buses to make sure that they are safe. Many local authorities used to run their own buses—I cannot remember whether this still happens under our new transport system. Those bus services were responsible to the local elected representatives. But that did not mean that they were excused from the public service vehicle regulations. It was rightly felt that outside monitoring of the standards being maintained in the local authority garages was necessary. I think that it is also necessary for the present school bus service. The last point, which I emphasise again, is that it is crystal clear that there is a close relationship between school transport and other forms of transport in rural areas. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
the past, the withdrawal of a contract for school transport has resulted in the closure of bus depots that were dependent on the cheque from the education authority. People in the wilder reaches of Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire might well say, "Eh, up, I think that you might be talking rubbish." They might think that there is a connection between the provision of their children's bus service, by special arrangement taking on a few other passengers as well, and the rest of the transport system. Some people would say "I don't agree. I think that it would be better if the school children had paid places on the normal village bus service so that we maintain our village bus service rather than having a special arrangement for the children which might well result in the village bus service disappearing altogether." [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some Back Bench Conservative hon. Members say that that has nothing to do with the Bill, I fail to understand what they have been doing while they have been sitting here. It has everything to do with the Bill. It also has something to do with the Education (No. 2) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my three comments on the clause. For all those reasons I shall certainly vote against clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tery Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout our discussions on the clause, most concern has been expressed about the effect of subsection (3), which deals with car sharing. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) has said that he still has not made up his mind whether it is a good or bad thing. He is an agnostic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I am inclined to have greater faith in the concept of car sharing. Whether car sharing is good, like many other things, depends on where you do it and who you do it with. Labour Ministers have been anxious, throughout the discussions on the clause, to ensure that the laudable aim of more car sharing in the circumstances described so often by the Parliamentary Secretary does not lead unintentionally to creating loopholes and to the abuse or a provision to create profit opportunities—not in the sense of a small profit being made by a man driving a car in which two or three other people are passengers on their way to work. That is not the sort of profit opportunity we are talking about. Labour Ministers have been concerned about subsection (3)
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
which is, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, a major change. Subsection (3) will lead to other people—I call them fiddlers and my hon. Friends have called them pirates—who will abuse the subsection and run businesses which will be difficult to stop, even though that is not the intention of the progressive members of the Government such as the Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever we have put forward possible restrictions, which might ensure that somebody does not abuse the clause or subsection, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have steadfastly refused to accept them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has said, this clause will become known as the "Fowler" clause and if it creates the loopholes that Labour Members fear may be created it will also become a pirates' charter. I accept that that may be unintentional, nevertheless it may happen. Whenever we have sought to stop it happening, the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the WRVS. Indeed, he has referred to the WRVS so often that I hope he will not take it amiss if I tell him that I nearly sent for a copy of the Register of Interests to see whether the Parliamentary Secretary had, at some time in the past, been listed as an adviser or consultant or was sponsored by the WRVS—not that I have anything against the WRVS—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He gets free meals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been very well connected with the WRVS in the past. I am sure that the description of the services provided by the WRVS, especially in rural areas, is accurate, but I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary's objection to the suggestions that we have put forward for amendments to the clause is valid. I wonder whether he has not made too much out of the WRVS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that there would be at least two defences for schemes run by the WRVS or similar organisations who assist people in rural areas who have hospital or dental appointments or who need to go to the nearest large town. Those schemes would be protected because such assistance would not be regular. The WRVS carries many people at different times on different days and weeks, but it would not carry the same people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
As I understand the notes that we were given, a basic reason for introducing subsection (3) has been the problem of obtaining regularity in car sharing schemes. Regularity supposes that there is both a recipient and the same contributor, in the sense of the same passenger. The WRVS in most cases, I believe, does not carry the same people to hospital. It runs a service for people in rural areas who need to get to a large town and different people will be carried at different times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, even if that defence is not available for the WRVS and similar organisations, I should have thought that it would still be able to plead that this was not in the course business. Subsection (3), as I understand it, does not establish the only grounds on which it can be argued that this scheme is not in the course of a business. It specifies one example where a car sharing scheme will not be regarded as being in the course of business. But I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary did not want to suggest to the Committee that that is the only basis of a car sharing scheme which is not in the course of business. Therefore WRVS, I should have thought, would have been well able to point out that it was not running the service in the course of business and therefore did not fall under the subsection. I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary has made too much of the effect on the WRVS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to associate myself with some of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras, South. I shall not repeat them because I am concerned to know what estimate the Minister has made of the effects of increased car sharing. It will not just be people who are now all driving their cars who will club together and share one car. The Minister accepts that some people now travelling by public transport will in the future involve themselves in car-sharing schemes, even in some cases where not even the driver of the car sharing scheme is using his car. It may well become more economical for people to club together in this way. That must be in the interests of the individuals, otherwise they would not make such an arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it would not be in the interests of
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
society as a whole if it led to a greater consumption of energy, rather than less, which was one of the Minister's reasons for the advocacy of car-sharing schemes. If one car makes a journey instead of four there is obviously a saving of energy, which is in the interests of society as a whole. But if more cars make that journey, rather than fewer, because people who at the moment travel on buses engage in car-sharing schemes, it is possible that the economics would be the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South I am an agnostic on that point because I do not have sufficient information. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us about the surveys that have been down and about the basis of his estimates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to put one specific question to my hon. Friend, as I am seeking some information. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) referred to the fact that it would be possible to advertise in a newsagent's. One should be able to advertise a car-sharing scheme in a newsagent's. I did not realise that that provision was in the Bill and I am seeking confirmation that that is so. I apologise if I have missed some earlier reference to it. I thought that advertising rules governed by part IV of schedule 1, which refers to places of worship, clubs or voluntary associations, premises occupied by a club, and so on, or information contained in any periodical. It does not mention newsagents. It was one of the defects of the Labour Administration's proposals that they were so restrictive in their advertising; they seemed to favour car-sharing so long as nobody knew about it and it could not possibly work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go even further. I rather like the idea of leaflets being distributed in villages to tell people that car-sharing will be available. But that kind of proposition does not appear to be entertained by the schedule and I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would confirm that it would be possible to advertise this facility in shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the second "stand part" debate, although it is probably a little too early to draw conclusions about how we should proceed with the clauses. If the two we have dealt with up to now are any guide at all, our debates on clauses lead to their being amended.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
However, I shall not enter controversial ground as to whether we improve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we started the clause it contained a provision regarding car-sharing which was the pride and joy of the Minister. I am sorry that that looks a little tarnished now. Having considered carefully a number of difficulties which were drawn to his attention, the Minister has made two amendments which have substantially changed it. I do not complain of that. I believe that Ministers should be prepared to take appropriate action when difficulties are pointed out in their legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I regret is that the changes that have been made in that respect in the course of our debates on clause 2 have not made clear what the Minister's intention is, particularly in this part which, as I have said, is his pride and joy. It was almost painful to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary seeking to answer the very direct and straightforward question of what offence was committed when one breached this provision and what was the penalty provided. He said that it may be that somebody who breaches it has been engaged in a business, but it may not, it may be that he should have had a road service licence, or it may not, it may even be that he should have been operating a public service vehicle, or it may not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a truly dramatic demonstration of lack of clarity, yet it came from a Parliament Secretary who, only a few sittings ago, was lecturing us on the great importance of clarity in this legislation. I hope that he will read his words and come back on Thursday a sadder and a wiser man. I recall very clearly his argument in reply when I argued that one of the merits of one of our amendments was that it was more elegant of phrasing and more concise. He told the Committee that we should disregard such merits if they in any way interfered with the most desirable quality of all in the wording of legislation—namely, that the meaning should be absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken that very much to heart, but it appears that the Parliamentary Secretary, with his great flexibility of mind, has altered his priorities as to how we should tackle this legislation. I shall not go over the point again. As my hon. Friends have said, the lack of clarity here would not lead, as we would desire with the passing of new legislation, to the stopping of abuses which have arisen from defects in the previous legislation, but in
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
practice would even encourage those abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting aspect of clause 2 has emerged from our debates. Certainly, it has led to my own enlightenment. It now appears that subsection (2) is really intended to cover contract carriage operation as well as taxis and hire cars. The clause is constructed, first, in subsection (1) to say what is a public service vehicle, and then, in the remaining subsections, to say what is not a public service vehicle. It then leaves one, on the basis of those two pieces of guidance, to pay one's money and take one's pick as to what a vehicle is in any particular circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that I think we can do in the debate on clause stand part, which we have certainly not been able to do up to now in the debates on the amendments, is to answer some of the questions thrown at us by the Minister and some of his hon. Friends as to what is our philosophy on car-sharing. It is a fair question. I believe that it is necessary to define a philosophy of car-sharing in the context of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I answer that question by saying that I believe that the purpose of a good law in the context of car sharing should be to recognise that the role of car sharing is to supplement rather than to substitute for public transport. If any law were to be based upon the proposition that car sharing should substitute for public transport, it would be detrimental to the transport interests of the people of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that Labour Members realise possibly more than Conservative Members the wide range of demand for public transport in our community. What may fit one area of the country may not necessarily fit another, and some of the broad generalisations that are thrown about when one debates the advantages of car sharing may be an absolute nonsense when applied in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Minister's claims about the savings of public transport, the saving of frustration and the saving of public transport difficulties which will flow from wider car sharing makes nonsense in the context of the Metropolis. I am not particularly worried about the Metropolis. I would sacrifice some inconvenience to the Metropolis for a better public service facility throughout the country. In this I might be at odds with my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), for understandable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the Metropolis, where about 90 per cent of the people come to work by public transport, even if one doubled the number of people travelling by private cars because of sharing arrangements, one would still have a Metropolis which was overwhelmingly dependent upon efficient public transport services for its operation. In that context, car sharing cannot in any circumstances that we can conceive avoid the major problems involved in sustaining and improving the public transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might abbreviate my arguments about this application because of the lateness of the hour, I should say simply this. The only circumstances in which I can conceive of a car sharing arrangement in any way easing a public transport system is in those few areas where it might be possible to organise car sharing for travel to work in peak hour times—or at any other times of peak demand on transport—in such a way that the public transport system can run with fewer vehicles. In many parts of the country the public transport service has to determine the number of vehicles it requires to run by the peak hour demand. Therefore, if one could have a carefully organised transport system which lifted off a bit of the peak, in those few places it might be possible to have a more economical public transport system. But that is not the aim of the car sharing provisions of the Bill, as was made very clear when our amendment to restrict journeys on an even wider basis was substantially rejected by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is a matter of philosophical difference in part. But underlying that difference there is a much more important argument, which we shall probably continue beyond the Bill and into many public transport debates in the House, the argument on what the approach of Government should be to public transport —whether it should be seen as the role of Government to sustain public transport on the basis of meeting not only majority but minority needs throughout the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against all the expectations of myself and a number of others, it may become possible for more people to operate private cars in the immediate future. I do not think that it will. I think that the pointers are towards fewer people. The total cost to the community and to the individual of
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
running a private car may rise to the point where the true cost is more than half the average take-home pay, in which a new demographic trend will be towards people choosing to travel in other ways and not to have a private car, to spend their money in other ways. That is more likely to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I am completely wrong and the time comes when the majority have access to a private car, there will still be a great advantage to our community if we can have a really efficient public transport service. If we can have that and develop our public transport service, we shall not only provide for the needs of those who do not have access to cars but we shall provide a valuable alternative to those who have cars but who choose at other times to use public transport services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the view that I take and my philosophy in my approach to the relationship between car sharing and public transport. It leads me, I regret to say, to wish to oppose the clause as not measuring up in any way to the real problems of that relationship in the present age or in any foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say straight away that no one is arguing or has been arguing during this long debate on clause 2 against conventional public transport. What we are arguing for is a new form of transport. It was less than two years ago that the right hon. Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers), who was then the Secretary of State for Transport, was saying in Committee on the Transport Bill that he believed that car sharing was the right way to proceed both for transport and energy reasons. We on this side agree very much with those sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are obvious differences, and it seems to me that in the last minutes of this debate we have come closer than at any stage during that debate. There are obviously differences between the two side of the Committee on car sharing and its implications. Clearly we seek to go further than Opposition Members would want to do. But I understand at any rate from the remarks of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and from what was said by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davies) and the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) that at any rate they do not reject the principle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
of car sharing. They may seek to limit it more than we do, but they do not reject that principle. We welcome that statement of policy as far as it goes, though it was certainly not the implication of much of this debate on this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the fears that have been expressed on car sharing will be groundless. We believe that this will not detract from the transport provision in this country, but that it will add to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) asks me about the amount of research that has been done on car sharing in the United Kingdom. There has been very little research in this area, for the good reason that there has been very little car sharing. But I would quote just one report, SR 358 from the TRRL. The General conclusions reached are that the potential gains from car pooling and sharing are worth pursuing and are most likely to be obtained by concentrating on work journeys, particularly in urban areas and industrial estates, with sharing arrangements initiated at the workplace rather than the home areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one aspect of the 1978 Act and it encourages us to go a step further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is our 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one aspect, I can quote all the TRRL reports, if necessary. There are three, and they are available for hon. Members to read. The point that I make is that there is little research inside the United Kingdom. In other countries notably the United States—not, for example, in respect of bus services, but in this respect—they have done far more work than we have done. Not only is this a major part of the energy conservation statement which was recently announced by the President of the United States, but Cities like Boston are seeking to bring forward major new car-sharing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have mentioned to the Committee before, that applies not only in the United States, but also in Europe—in West Germany, as I was told by the Minister of Transport there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Opposition Members who say that they believe in the principle of car sharing should at least give it enthusiastic support.</p>
	<p>I wish to echo the contention of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) that the provision would benefit the ordinary motorist. I believe that that is right. The previous Government sensibly recognised that car sharing for contributions should be encouraged and that it should be put on a legal footing. We have taken it a stage further. The 1978 Act was, in my view, half hearted in one respect. It produced the absurd situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) mentioned concerning advertising. It was legal to put on a factory notice board a notice advertising a lift, but it was illegal to put a notice on the board of the newsagent down the road. It is exactly that kind of absurd advertising restriction that we seek to remove. When we debate schedule 1, I think that my hon. Friend will see the full implications of this move. I can certainly give him the assurance that the Government have acted in the way in which we said we would act when we discussed the matter under the 1978 Bill. My hon. Friend has had a large part to play in that.</p>
	<p>We have had a long debate. The present Government intend to go forward with car sharing. The Bill is a start. It permits advertising and defines more clearly the contributions that the driver may collect. When the Bill is enacted I shall consider what can be done to increase car sharing and my Department will give it every encouragement. The provision is positive and in my view will help ordinary people and the economy. I am not going to allow it to be defeated by some of the arguments from those with vested interests. Car sharing makes sense. I think that the public support this kind of approach and I urge the Committee to support it.</p>
