	<time>Tuesday 29 January 1980</time>

	<p>[PART II]</p>

	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>TRANSPORT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>[	<i>Continuation from col.</i> 702]</p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before the perpetual bells rang I was dealing with the fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee. I risk repeating myself here, but nowhere was that difference more blatant than in our discussion on increasing the 30-mile limit to 50 miles. It puts at risk—I emphasise "at risk"—a matter of £5½ million, which could be used for cross-subsidisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the £5½ million before the Committee adjourned. I am told that the sum of £5½ million which he says is at risk outside the 30-mile limit as the Bill stands is £5½ million in receipts, not £5½ million in profits. The sum of £5½ million would not be available for cross-subsidisation even if it were the case that that was what it would all be used for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for that observation. However, it does not alter the fundamental principle that if the £5½ million is in receipts so long as a proportion of it could be used for cross-subsidisation, it is at risk. The fundamental difference between us, whether it be £5½ million or £75½ million, is that that amount of money which could be used for cross-subsidisation is at risk. We could argue about the figures. It is true that the £5½ million is in receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that that £5½ million in receipts amounts to—to throw a figure in the air—£2 million for cross-subsidisation. Whether it be £2 million or £1 million—the precise amount is irrelevant—the Bill will make less of it available for cross-subsidisation. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will concede that much. He can argue about the figures, but he cannot argue that money for cross-subsidisation is not at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
Sometimes it seems important that, as we sit within these enclosed walls, we should see each other as other people see us. The point has been made that the Opposition are throwing in hypothetical arguments. It has also been argued that the professionals who operate transport day by day have a vested interest. That could be true. Nevertheless, it is also true that they are operating those businesses day by day. When we discuss amendment No. 75 we are concerned with the level of cross-subsidisation. We are asking the traffic commissioner to look not only at the new service but also at any existing service. The key phrase is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the likely effect of each on the viability of the other".</p></blockquote>
I shall not transgress and go beyond the area which I serve, but it is well known in the House that I am an NUR-sponsored Member of Parliament. I hope that that fact is registered. Before anyone faints in anticipation I shall reveal that I have here a 38-page document. Far be it from me to read it to the Committee in its entirety. I should not dream of wasting the Committee's time by doing that. I could take the best part of three hours going through the document item by item. I am sure that during that period you would, quite correctly, call me to order, Mr. English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible that I might even point out to the hon. Gentleman that he would not be allowed to read the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Copious notes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having taken that possibility into consideration before coming back into the Committee, I shall certainly not read it. But it seems to me relevant that here we have the views not of people who sit at this time of night discussing the theatrical aspects of the Bill, but of those who work in the service. How do they, the professional operators, see the Bill? I shall not transgress into other areas, but in this 38-page document, which again I shall categorically refuse to read in its entirety, points of view are expressed which sum up the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the traffic commissioner looks not only at particular services but has the interests of the public at heart. He should not say that a service is relevant without taking cognisance of other services. In the area of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
Ashington—for the benefit of the Committee that is about 15 miles from Newcastle—the NUR, rightly or wrongly, organises busmen. That is nothing to do with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NUR members at Ashington, having read the Bill, are looking for areas that will affect them. That is reasonable. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have at our depot a number of services that would inevitably be cut if private operators were allowed to run in conjunction with our vehicles."</p></blockquote>
Their view is that competition is inevitably wasteful. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, if for example a private operator"—</p></blockquote>
I beg the indulgence of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, that is not what they are saying at all. They are saying that they do not like the effects of competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Member speak for these people when he does not have the letter? I have the letter. It is clear what they are saying. The hon. Gentleman's synopsis of what he thinks they are saying is not relevant to what they have actually said. If he will allow me to continue I shall highlight the point. They are not frightened of competition. They are frightened of what the clause is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, they say that if the lucrative areas are taken away, other areas will suffer. That is the fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee. That is what the clause is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, from what he has read out. The writers of the letter are saying that they would like to be cross-subsidised by other people paying for their fares. They are saying precisely that they do not like the effects of competition on them. If the hon. Gentleman understands what the letter is about, he will appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has his point of view, and I have mine. That is not what they are saying. If he will allow me to read from the document I shall certainly give way again afterwards. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, if for example a private operator was allowed to pick off"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
—the key phrase is "pick off"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the best of the service number 420 running from Ashington to Alnwick, which serves 9 villages on route, then throughout the off-peak period"</p></blockquote>
—this is his opinion, not mine, and he is entitled to it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I foresee no bus at all for these people."</p></blockquote>
—That is if the Bill goes through. That is the nub of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I shall upset Conservative Members, but this is a crucial issue. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If this Bill goes through, the effect of non-trade union firms, working with cheap labour, will be cuts in all services provided by United"</p></blockquote>
—the service we are talking about—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… and the loss to the public of regular services."</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the issue. If the lucrative areas are picked off, inevitably everyone will flow towards them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are asking the traffic commissioner to do is not to take cognisance of only one service, but to do so right across the board. I say again that the fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee is that Government members seek to pick off the lucrative areas and let the devil take the hindmost while we do not take that view. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking only about Ashington. Let us go also to the urban areas, such as the constituency I represent, to be considered. I suspect that this is germane to many areas. What do the people from Newcastle who operate services outside and inside the city and in the inner urban areas say? The latter states, and again we come to the nub of the problem:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In general, services in the South-East of the County are broadly profitable and those in the North-West are lossmakers."</p></blockquote>
Of course they are. An operator knows the geography of the area. It seems likely that United would have to fight back if private people moved in by cutting fares and extra services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obvious effects of that are twofold. If United cut its services one could applaud that, but if by cutting services and fares in effect it cut rural services, would transport have been improved in the networks? It is easy to say that we should let in the private people, but can any member of the Committee see private operators rushing into the rural areas? Of course not. What they will do is rush into those areas which normally would make a profit which, under present legislation, is used for cross-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
subsidising rural services. I remind the Committee that many hon. Members here represent rural constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will they say when the Bill is enacted and rural services are slashed in the areas they represent because all the operators who dashed in to make profits taken from cross-subsidisation are no longer there? It will be interesting to see what happens. I could go on. The area of which I speak covers the whole of Northumberland county council and Tyne and Wear county council. When I use the words "county council", I speak not only of Northumberland but also of Tyne and Wear. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the County Council were to allow services to be cut in the loss-making area, many of the services"—</p></blockquote>
—excuse me, Mr. English, if I refer to areas about which I know something—"in Hemhamshire might be cut, and Wooler might end up with virtually no service at all."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the Bill that will improve transport across the board!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter goes further. Alnwick, on the Northumberland Coast, is a scenic area, beautiful in summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very nice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously my hon. Friend has visited it. It is beautiful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect to consider. Let us suppose that, under the Bill, the operators run those services only during the toutist period. People will flock in because that is where the lucrative trade is, but because firms such as National Bus Company operate all year round, they find that they can cross-subsidise in an area such as Wooler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an intimate knowledge of the area of which my hon. Friend speaks. I served on Tynemouth county borough council, and I was a parliamentary candidate for a consistency which covered Tynemouth and Whitley Bay. I put it to my hon. Friend that the problem of cross-subsidisation in that area is not only one of choosing between what are and are not tourist routes. The service which runs through Wallsend, North Shields, Tynemouth and Whitley Bay serves tourists in the summer, but it is vital that it is kept running for people who need it to get to and from work in that area. So there is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
element of cross-subsidisation which depends upon the service being run all year round, with profits made in the summer keeping it going through the winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were possible, under the provisions of the clause as unamended, for people to pick the period of the year they ran services in, even if they ran the same routes, it would be detrimental to those living in the area all the year round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a valuable point. Obviously he knows the area. This amendment is again crucial here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consider what my right hon. Friend said about knowing the area well, having lived there all his life. It is true that in summer many tourists visit the area and it is profitable. But that profit is channelled back for the bad weather. In some parts of the area there can be 6-foot and 7-foot drifts, and the only means of transport is those subsidised services which do not make a profit during that time. But because we have a system whereby the profits in the summer are garnered back to the community in the winter, we have a service. If that is taken away and everyone moves into the summer trade, what happens to the people there during the winter? Can the Minister answer that? There is no longer cross-subsidisation because all the sharks have moved in and garnered off the fat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may shake his head, but that is what will happen. Who serves the communities in those nine villages during the winter? That is what cross-subsidisation is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman is giving way, the other hon. Gentleman may intervene. Only one hon. Member may be on his feet at one time. The hon. Member who has the Floor must determine for himself whether or not he is giving way. If he is, the hon. Member opposite may speak. If the hon. Member is not giving way, the other hon. Member may not speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, Mr. English, on every occasion that 1 have spoken in this debate when an hon. Member has asked me to give way, I have done so. If the hon. Gentleman will ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
me to give way, undoubtedly I will do so, but when I am not asked to give way, and hon. Members opposite are holding a sub committee, to whom do I give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member was to rise at this time and catch my eye, without doubt I would do so. But until that happens how I know who to give way to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all the earnestness and sincerity I can muster, I ask the hon. Member to give way. I notice that he has already done so, for which I am truly obliged. Will he put some figures to the tremendous generalisations he has made? Will he indicate what profit level, if there is one, bus operators are making in the areas of which he speaks? Also, will he indicate in actual figures what further subsidy is being received from other sources, in order to make valid his argument that cross-subsidisation is the only reason for the survival of those services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the valid argument in my point about the profit margin. One effect, until these sharks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am trying hard if we are allowed a few hours to debate the matter. Time is irrelevant to me. The nub of the issue is that such figures would be relevant when the sharks have moved in. Without cross-subsidisation and, in some cases, help from the county council, a large number of the services I have talked about, in Wooller, Alnwick and places like that, would not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go to Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in Cornwall, which he and his colleagues seem to have a great interest in, there has been no threat to cross-subsidisation but that the threat to remove county council subsidies has caused the pruning of services? It seems that the hon. Gentleman is still evading the question. He must
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
be far more clear about the percentage of profit being made in the profitable services to apply to cross subsidisation, otherwise he is making a lame argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member has not been listening very carefully. When I referred to the document from which I was reading—it has about 38 pages and I assured the Committee that I would not mention those pages—I specifically said that I would not stray into the realms of other hon. Members' constituencies. That is why I have not strayed into Cornwall, much as I should like to go to Cornwall, as it is a beautiful place. I shall deal conclusively with the area I know best. Undoubtedly the hon. Member can deal satisfactorily with Cornwall. He would not want me to stray to Cornwall from the North-East, nor would it be my pleasure to do so. Who am I to stray across his borders? I have refrained from doing so, and yet he invites us. Do I need to go to page 29 of the document? I shall leave that for the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no shadow of doubt that over a period the areas I am talking about would lose if there were no cross-subsidisation. That has been proved time and again. When some long routes have been cut and the county council has had to step in, there had to be negotiations between the United Bus Company and the county council and cross-subsidisation had to be made, otherwise that service would not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of the Bill that would cease as people moved into the lucrative sector. Can the hon. Member for Babington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) see all these people who intend to move in moving into the rural areas where the loss-making parts of transport are? If he can, I shall be interested in what he has to say. But, competition is the process of getting a monopoly. One cuts prices and puts the other guy out of the trade, then one has the monopoly and puts the prices up. That is the fundamental of competition and has been from time immemorial. We maintain that that is not in the best interests of transport. It may be in the best interests of certain transport, but to maintain the network across the country it is not the way to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have noticed that the hon. Gentleman has failed totally to produce any figures. I ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
him this simple question. Does he think that it is fair that those who happen to be on routes which are most used should pay towards fares of those on unprofitable routes? Does he think it fair that those who happen to travel in the peak season should pay towards the fares of those who happen to be there in the winter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is perfectly reasonable. Why not? We are talking about the good of all. That is a fundamental difference between this side of the Committee and the Government. Conservative Members are saying that those who can afford it can have a service. The hon. Member asked whether I agreed that people on routes which are most used should pay towards fares of those on unprofitable ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think it fair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, why not? We pay taxes and the subsidies are taken out of taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taxation is authorised by this House, but what the hon. Member is describing is a purely arbitrary arrangement that applies in a particular locality. I ask the hon. Member again: does he think it fair that people should pay if they happen to be on a profitable route for those travelling on an unprofitable route and who are not prepared to pay what it costs to run that section of that route?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I believe in networks. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is fundamentally this: I believe that a transport system should serve the vast majority of people. Having said that, let me rephrase what the hon. Gentleman said. He seems to be in favour of a lucrative route being hived off to private enterprise and the profits going into the individual's pocket. There is a fundamental difference between us on that because I support the lucrative routes being used to subsidise those that are not lucrative. But the hon. Gentleman is quite prepared to have a long-distance route going to the private individual. He is saying "The devil take the hindmost and never mind the rural areas." I disagree with that view. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
what the hon. Member is saying is fair in this context, the crippled and the lame can go to the wall. Why should we worry about the crippled and the lame? The hon. Member says that if someone cannot pay, let them go to the wall.

I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary was laughing, but he so agrees with the point I am making that he is crying. There is a conversion in itself. The Parliamentary Secretary is converted to the belief that, overall, everybody should benefit. That is not what the Bill says. The Bill says "The devil take the hindmost and if the Conservatives can get the profit into private individuals' pockets, it does not matter whether there is a service in the villages."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should a traffic commissioner not have a remit to look overall at all services? It makes a fundamental difference that if one can hive off all those things that are good, it means that at the end of the day other people have no service whatever. The Bill will do nothing to serve the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get back to these people who are doing this not because they have a draftsman's clause in a Bill but because it is their bread and butter. When it is one's bread and butter, one is fond to look at how one is affected by it. Nothing clarifies one's mind as much as those who depend on the business at hand. Those are people who have looked at it very closely and considered all aspects, because, if they had not done so, they would never have written it. They said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even if we were to be attacked only in the rural areas on poor routes"—</p></blockquote>
they are looking at the overall situation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"this could have an adverse effect".</p></blockquote>
The next part sums up fundamentally why the amendment should be carried—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even a loss-making route will be making a contribution"</p></blockquote>
to overall finances. The poor routes will, without doubt, be subsidised by the more lucrative routes. Some proportion of even a loss-making route will make a contribution. One could compare it with a tree and consider the trunk as the lucrative area. The arterial movement in the trunk would depend on the branches to feed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are saying that we shall have the trunk and anybody can have the branches. If there are no branches and no profit, that is it.

We say to the Traffic Commissioners "Do not look only at the services placed in front of you, but at the overall service to the community." I wonder what will happen when the Bill becomes an Act. We win all the arguments, even though the Government win the votes, but the Bill will become an Act. Then shall we see Conservative Members tripping in their thousands to the Minister of Transport and saying: "Did you mean this, bonnie lad, because in my area all transport has ceased?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will forgive me but his theory that there are Conservative Members in their thousands, proves that he is staying from the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should it be hundreds of thousands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your superior judgment, Mr. English. Whether it be thousands, hundreds, or just one, the principle is the same. They will be beating a path to the Minister and the carpets in Transport House—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. The hon. Gentleman said 10 minutes ago "In ending". Does he have no obligation to use those words in their accepted meaning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will find, particularly when he comes to be in Opposition, that the farther end of the word "ending" is an almost limitless distance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the present Government are ever in Opposition, I doubt whether I shall be here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter statement was one that, knowing the hon. Gentleman well, I should not have made. However, since he has made it himself, who am I to disagree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But without a doubt Conservative Members will be beating a path to the Minister's door to say "Did you mean this?", and he will say "No". But we shall say "Ah, but you did". Rural areas that have no transport will be able to blame the Bill. It will give freedom without
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it for me to seek to bore the Committee. I am undoubtedly successful at that, but let us consider amendment No. 76. Normally I have two pairs of glasses because if I miss what the Under-Secretary says, at least I can see him. He replied to my hon. Friend on that amendment. For those who do not know what I am talking about, it is contained in a letter that anyone may read. Amendment No. 76 seeks to leave out "by those authorities". The Minister replied that that could not apply only to the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make sure that there is no chance of anyone reading the Bill, seeing the words "by those authorities", and supposing that it means only by those authorities. The Minister said that subsection 3(	<i>c</i>) makes that point. With great respect—I have a great respect for the Minister's arguments, although I do not always agree with them—that does not take care of the point at all. If "by those authorities" is removed, the subsection would clearly mean that not only those authorities but anyone else could make an objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to help the Government, as we have done time and again, with constructive amendments yet the Minister says that the matter is cleared up by subsection 3(	<i>c</i>) which provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any objections or representations made to the commissioners in the prescribed manner which in their opinion are relevant."</p></blockquote>
Fair enough. But the previous paragraph says "by those authorities". If a layman reads that he would say "That applies only to those authorities". If we take out "by those authorities", the layman—who will undoubtedly, night and day, carry the Bill in his pocket as his Bible—will realise that it does not mean only those authorities but
	<br><blockquote><p>"any objections or representations made to the commissioners in the prescribed manner which in their opinion are relevant."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that the Minister does not create a lawyer's paradise, but agree to the amendment and makes clear beyond doubt that objections may not necessarily be made only by those authorities. He has said that it will add nothing to the clarity of the Bill. But we are seeking to help the Minister and make sure that there is no confusion. He has the audacity to say that we are not helping him. We have had a great debate on whether to take out "by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
those authorities". Why should it not be taken out? It would make the Government's intention clear to everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a full debate on this group of amendments, which is not surprising because as has been said, they seek to make a substantial policy change in the Bill. All the amendments turn on the important point of how the traffic commissioners are meant in future to approach their task of granting road service licences. I agree entirely with the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member of Faversham (Mr. Moate) who clearly put the Government's case for the Bill, encapsulated as it is in clause 5. He revealed thereafter the very wide gulf between the various approaches to public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change made in clause 5 is often referred to as a change in the burden of proof or the onus of proof, both of which are rather legalistic terms. From the point of view of the general public, it is easiest if one establishes what the traffic commissioners' duties will be once we change the climate by passing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will in future be their duty to grant an application for a road service licence in accordance with the terms of the application, unless they are positively satisfied that it is against the interests of the public to do so. The result is that, when applications are made, the traffic commissioners will refuse only those cases where it has been seriously established and proved that the grant of a new licence would be against the public interest. Again, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) said, the assumption will be that the applicant will get his new licence, but the application will be tested by the traffic commissioners to make sure that no damage will be done to the public if that licence is granted. It is a wholly different approach from anything previously contemplated by many people in public transport and certainly by many Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one approaches the matter as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) just did, on the basis that the main interest is to be established by looking at the views of those who happen to work in an NUR-dominated atmosphere in the particular pattern of services in North-East England, one comes to the conclusion that there should be no change in the setup, that anybody who subsidises the
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
services he works on is thereby doing a service to the public and that the best thing to do is to leave matters alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that that approach, which has persisted in one way or another over the last 50 years, has in recent years led to an increase in the rate at which the standard and pattern of bus services on the road has deteriorated steadily. Unless something is done to change the climate, that deterioration is liable to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central summed up the argument which has crossed my mind before. I think that I said on Second Reading that it was often the favourite argument of the more traditionalist people in public transport to say "We don't mind if it declines. If you leave it alone, it will carry on declining in a way with which we are familiar and which we understand. We hope thereby that the loss of our members' jobs will be somewhat slower, if we are lucky, than it has been in recent years." That is a thoroughly defeatist approach to public transport. Since this is a market, parts of which are under-travelled and probably under-exploited, it is not a good one for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we are putting this new duty on the traffic commissioners and altering the climate in that way, plainly we are still preserving a traffic commissioners approach. We accept that there is public interest and that there is a need, outside trial areas, which I shall reserve till later, for traffic commissioners to go in for quantity licensing to make sure that the interests of the general public are not damaged by random applications for new licences which will bring short-term benefits but long-term disadvantages. That is what the traffic commissioners must consider before they grant any licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are discussing in all these amendments is how best we should illustrate the task of the traffic commissioners and to what criteria they should address themselves. The two points which we are setting out and which arise in all the amendments are, first, what criteria they should apply in determining the most important thing of all—the public interest in any application—and, secondly, who shall be directly involved in the process of giving evidence and in discussion at the public hearings to help the traffic commissioners arrive at the right conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue in both cases is how far Parliament should produce a list either of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
those criteria or of the people who ought to be involved. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) pointed out the absurdities to which one would come if one tried to draw up an exhaustive list of people, thus illustrating the dangers of a list approach. If one tries to produce an endless list of criteria—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One already exists. The hon. Gentleman is deleting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —one can produce arguments, some of them doctrinal arguments, some of them competing arguments, about the economics of passenger transport such as cross-subsidisation; one could produce an ever-longer list. One runs the risk of thereby enhancing arguments which at the moment seem to us to be important but possibly excluding arguments which will turn out to be relevant in an individual application before the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if one tries to produce a list of people, one will produce a list of those who seem to be put in the forefront of the commissioners in a privileged position and then one leaves out a group with direct interest in the application before the commissioners because it is not mentioned on the stutory list of those whose representations have to be listened to—for instance, a community group representing a village which thinks that its services are threatened. They are relegated to the "others" in the Opposition amendment, whilst various other bodies take precedence. Trade unions even are relegated in the Opposition's amendment behind various other bodies which have representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are prepared to do in the Bill is to set out the principles on which we intend the traffic commissioners to act. We have set out the new duty to grant applications unless they are satisfied that it is against the public interest, and we give an indication of areas which they must examine to determine the public interest, all of which will enable the relevant arguments pertaining to that locality and that application to be admitted and given the weight which they ought to have, and allow all-comers to come to the hearing as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
Let me illustrate how far the criteria that we have chosen will embrace all these various arguments. Among the three that we have chosen, what is most important is that they are not exclusive; they are simply factors that the traffic commissioners
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall in particular have regard to".</p></blockquote>
The one factor in the end to which they should have regard is what the evidence indicates is the public interest in the locality to which the application refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, the commissioners should first have regard to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transport requirements of the area as a whole"—</p></blockquote>
the geography is slightly qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision encourages the traffic commissioners to take the widest possible view of the needs of the travelling public and, to some extent, of the interests of the operators, but basically, and most important of all, of the effect on the transport needs of the various communities affected. They must take into account not only the communities through which the new services will go but even the transport services already provided in the same communities and the effect upon the transport requirements of adjoining communities. The traffic commissioners will therefore have to listen to all evidence which tends to suggest that the application makes a positive addition to the needs of the travelling public where they are not being satisfied and also evidence, if any is brought forward, which suggests that it will cause damage to the transport requirements of some other locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), I am not happy with the version of cross-subsidisation put forward repeatedly by Labour Members. But the important thing it that their arguments are not shut out by the Bill. I do not agree with their arguments, and they are not supported by evidence from my hon. Friend the Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale), who tried to suggest to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central that the mere assertion of his NUR grant might be a little more convincing if it were backed by the slightest reference to the facts and finances of the services he is talking about, one assumes that before the traffic commissioners the hon. Member would back up some of these assertions. His assertion is not excluded and it can be taken against the competing evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
Our Bill does not shut out any relevant arguments which bear any relationship to the transport requirements of the area. Although they have not succeeded in the wording that they have chosen, what Labour Members would like to guarantee, if they could, is that the traffic commissioners would not be bound to accept the economics of public transport. They are not shut out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the NUR in the Newcastle area wants to make representations against new applicants who are proposing to provide new services in an area which its organisation serves and argue against the application, our Bill will not prevent it from going along, producing its 38-page letter and putting the case for the traffic commissioners to weigh up against other evidence to see whether they are satisfied, and whether it can be proved to them that the transport interests of the area will be damaged in the way claimed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has asserted on three occasions that the Bill does not shut out certain types of representation and that therefore the mention of these types of representation in the amendment is irrelevant. Will he confirm that a number of the types of representation included in the amendment are provisions within existing law? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If that is an argument, we can come to that later, but not on this intervention. I believe that, if the Minister examines the evidence carefully, he will see that some of the bodies we have listed are covered by existing law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right, the courts may well construe—if the matter goes to court—that Parliament intended by this Bill to shut out people who are specifically covered by the law as it stands, and they may therefore be precluded from doing what the hon. Gentleman is asserting that the Bill does, while it makes no specific reference to doing what he says it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make comparisons with existing legislation in a moment. Let me first explain that there are two points here. First, should we list the criteria by which applications should be judged? Secondly, should we list the people who should be given a special right of audience?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I shall illustrate in a moment, the provisions that the Opposition propose in the amendment are not even in existing legislation. They are a new gloss that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
Oppostion seek to introduce. The criteria are not there at present and they are irrelevant because none of the arguments that are being put forward are excluded by the phrasing:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transport requirements of the area as a whole".</p></blockquote>
That means that I need not go far into the arguments about cross-subsidisation, which have so concerned the Committee. I have indicated that I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham. Perhaps I should make a final attempt to get across to the Opposition what we mean by cross-subsidisation. We are not against the idea of cross-subsidisation in all circumstances. It has its place. But at present it is used as a catch-all excuse for continuing the present pattern of services, and it does not have the wholly desirable results that Labour Members claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point that was ignored by Opposition Members was the effect of the policy of cross-subsidisation as at present followed on passengers who have the comparative misfortune to live on quite busy routes. The elementary principle of cross-subsidisation is not quite as put forward by the Opposition. Cross-subsidisation means that those passengers who live on the busier routes contribute through their fares and through their services to the passenger needs of people who live on less busy routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we believe in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Opposition believe in, but they ignore some of the unfortunate effects that that has on the better routes and on the transport needs of the areas as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It means, for a start, that fares are higher than they need be on the busier routes. It means, as my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham said, that the services can be less intense and less well financed and invested in than they would otherwise be. It means, therefore, that, on what would be busy routes, people who might travel by bus are encouraged to travel by car, because the bus fares are kept artificially high. It means that inefficiencies are built into the network that the Opposition defend, and inefficiencies are cushioned against their financial consequences by an elaborate network of cross-subsidisation and subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
my hon. Friend's extremely clear explanation of our arguments. We all accept that there may be a limiting case over a small area where cross-subsidisation is necessary. Perhaps my hon. Friend might bring out the real absurdity of the Opposition's extreme position by supposing that there is a certain bus route, and 10 miles beyond the end of that bus route is one chap who wants to travel by bus. Do they really think that that service should be provided and paid for by all the other people on the existing routes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the extreme case. We may make the Opposition react on the basis of extremes. They have been presenting our case at its extreme, as though we are indifferent to the smaller communities and off-peak services and so on. The fact remains that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that my alternate in the Chair said that this should be a wide debate. It seems to me that it has got very wide indeed. The principal amendment under discussion, No. 75, refers to the inter-relationship of the proposed new service with any existing service. If we are discussing cross-subsidisation, which, as far as my limited knowledge goes, applies to almost every known service in the sense that the shorter services in the centre of cities are usually over-charged and longer services to the suburbs are usually under-charged, it would be better to discuss the matter when we were not discussing a rather limited amendment referring to the relationship between a new service and the existing one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Whilst there may be difficulties on the interpretations of different Chairmen, I am still operating on the understanding that "inter-relationship" refers also to the interpretation of public interest as presently defined in the Bill, and that inevitably raises the matter of cross-subsidiation. I have deliberately said nothing in the debate on these amendments because I understood that one would be able to comment on cross-subsidiation on the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. We have been discussing cross-subsidisation since we returned from dinner. I am sure you would not wish
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
us to repeat the debate time and time again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will accept your ruling, Mr. English, and will not take the matter any further. I strayed in replying to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and others, all of whom had made the burden of their speeches cross-subsidisation. I hope I made it clear that we are sceptical of the arguments and would not wish to seek to enshrine them in the Bill as a principle that the traffic commissioners would have to follow but which is not excluded by the terms of the Bill. Although they fail to satisfy us, those with whom they agree could seek to satisfy the traffic commissioners in the case of an individual application within the limits of paragraph (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to sub-paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which has caused difficulties because, again, it touches on those people who are allowed to make representations to the traffic commissioners. Sub-paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is the only reference in the section to a particular group of people whom the commissioners are enjoined to have regard to—that is, to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any transport policies or plans which have been made by the local authorities concerned and have been drawn to the commissioners' attention by those authorities;…"</p></blockquote>
This covers the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley. "Those authorities", as is made clear by subsection (4) refers, in London, to the Greater London Council but everywhere else to the county councils or the metropolitan county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are the one group of people whose views the traffic commissioners are particularly enjoined to have regard to. That is because of their statutory position as the transport planning authority—a position they were given by the Labour Administration—a position they should take seriously and which we have no intention whatever of challenging. We believe that they should take their transport planning functions seriously and that nothing in the Bill should seem to cut across their planning function. For that reason, the words "by those authorities" are retained. They are the only group of people whose opinions, policies and plans the commissioners are enjoined by statute to have particular regard to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will accept
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
that it therefore follows that they should pay particular heed to those policies, plans and representations of those authorities which are given the transport planning function. The reason we have put that in is, first, to seek to anticipate in part—I shall come later to the point about the commissioners being non-elected—the special role of county councils which take active steps to take on a transport planning role. The whole purpose of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is to enshrine their function and to give them a special voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras, South picked up from the notes on clauses with which we provided the Committee, this gives the Council's a wide brief to put forward representations of all kinds on their policies and plans. It would enable them to press upon the traffic commissioners the FTP and remind the traffic commissioners that they are enjoined to have special regard to the policies put forward in the annual PTP. It is not confined to statutory representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that arises is that the latest published policy or plan may not be up to date. So again, by way of policy or plan, it can be resolved in committee or the committee can authorise an officer's letter bringing up to date precisely what the policy of the county or metropolitan county council is towards a group of services. The council's are, therefore, given by the words "by those authorities", the particular role of bringing forward the most up-to-date information about the county's policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fail to follow all the aspects of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) on which he places so much credence was so unclear that the Government have had to table amendment No. 47 to insert "other representations". We are seeking to help the Government by taking "other authorities" out of the main part of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is there to meet the concern, which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) has been expressing, county councils and metropolitan county councils who have a transport planning function and who, understandably, are worried
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
that they might get lost in the morass of representations, having traffic commissioners taking views contrary to their own. Traffic commissioners are not bound to take their view, but I shall deal with that at a later stage in my speech. Nevertheless, the Commissioners are enjoined to have special regard to the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) covers everybody else. The commissioners are also enjoined to pay regard to any objections or representations made to them
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the prescribed manner which in their opinion are relevant."</p></blockquote>
Government amendment No. 47 is the most piffling change of wording of no significance whatever, other than representing an improvement in the language. "Representations" is an all-embracing word which includes support and objections. The result is that all objections are representations, but all representations are not objections. In order, therefore, to improve the wording of the Bill it was felt desirable to put in the word "other" to make it clear that it was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any objections or other representations".</p></blockquote>
If any member of the Committee expresses the slightest doubt about the amendment I shall drop it immediately. It is pedantry and a change of phrasing, merely to improve the English. There is no other significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where paragraph (	<i>c</i>) has significance is that it enables anybody to make representations. As the law stands, the groups who can make representations are defined, although in practice the traffic commissioners do not shut out anybody else. Anybody with a relevant interest tends to be given a right of audience. We think that anybody should be given a statutory right and the only right that should be given to refuse evidence is if someone gives evidence that is plainly irrelevant—if he has some flat earth theory of his own which everybody else for and against the argument realises is of no use whatever in assisting a conclusion. We are giving, for the first time, a statutory right to community groups, to trade unions and other bodies with an interest which might want to give evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would touch briefly on the comparisons between this and the previous law. Leaving aside the change in the burden of proof, which is the most important thing, we are making the most trifling changes to the present law, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
has not given rise to any difficulties. Some of the criteria which have to be considered are covered by paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) which are already in the 1960 Act. Paragraph (	<i>c</i>) is new in that it widens the scope of those able to make representations. The suitability of the routes and the convenience of the disabled we removed to another part of the Bill to make them conditions but in no way have we relegated the right to impose conditions on routes or the right to make conditions about the disabled. We have left out a previous criterion—the need to provide and maintain efficient services to meet those requirements. That seems to us to be a pious expression of what should be aimed at in meeting the transport needs of the area. We have, therefore, omitted it,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the criteria have not changed from those in the Road Traffic Act 1960, section 135(2)(	<i>a</i>) as amended. I think the hon. Gentleman is using an unamended original copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have excluded no one. Because people such as chief officers of police and those from district councils are people who ought to have a voice, we have put them in in subsection (5) as people who must be notified of an application. It follows from that that we are expecting them to make representations that concern them and we hope that any elected, genuinely representative body, and anybody with the responsibilities of the chief officer of police would be given a voice and a weight by any sensible commissioners. I am sure that we can trust the commissioners to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that this gives or retains power for the traffic commissioners and they are not elected and not responsible to be given that power. They have always had that power and independence. We believe, on balance, that it is right that they should. We have merely altered the burden of proof before them and made it clear that they should normally entertain applications unless they are satisfied that the applications would do damage to the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, against the commissioners, a right of appeal to the Minister who is answerable to an elected body, although I know that that will not entirely satisfy my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley, who would like the elected authorities to take an even bigger role. That might be more appropriate in West
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
Midlands county council where the county has taken an active and direct role in planning and transport. In other areas that would involve sweeping away the present powers of the traffic commissioners and giving them to county councils who are not interested in engaging so directly in transport provision. To those who want public accountability I say that all decisions can be appealed to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that all appeals are entertained by Ministers on the basis of the facts in that case and are approached with an open mind. An appeal is a review of the evidence which the commissioners receive and of the conclusion to which the commissioners came. Let there be no doubt that the policy of the Government as incorporated in the Bill will be followed through in the policy of Ministers in considering appeals. It seems to us that the duty of Ministers hearing appeals, even under present law, let alone the laws that will be amended by our Bill, is to have regard to the public interest in the broadest sense and the transport needs of the public in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy is a positive approach, which believes that new services, new applicants, changes in the existing pattern of transport service are desirable, unless one can see, on the evidence and facts of the particular case, that that will do damage to the public interest if permitted to go ahead. In the end that is the final way in which the new policy is enshrined and I hope that hon. Members will agree that clause 5, with no amendment, other than the Government amendment, will help us to bring about that concept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quoting from the notes on clauses, I am most concerned that traffic commissioners will be required:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to grant a road service licence on an application unless they are satisfied that it would be against the interests of the public to do so. They must grant the licence in the terms applied for except to the extent that they are satisfied that that would be against the interests of the public".</p></blockquote>
I am opposed to the way it is given in favour of the applicant, particularly without the standard requirements set out in section 140 of the Road Traffic Act 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of the public can be interpreted widely or narrowly. No doubt Tories will see the interests of the public being served by encouraging competition on passenger service routes without recognising that this same competition will tend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
to kill off the servicing of unprofitable routes by the established public bus companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the only Scottish member of the Committee, so I would expect to draw attention to the Scottish Transport Group, which is the major bus operator in Scotland. Its annual report and accounts for 1978—the last year for which they have so far been published—show that in 1978 gross receipts were £86.4 million, vehicle miles were 126.9 million and passengers carried were 350.9 million. The group owned 3,920 buses at the end of 1978, and employed 12,720 persons. The value of the vehicles owned by the group was £66,560,000. That was 13 months ago, and that figure has no doubt increased considerably since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly plenty of scope for private operators to move in and cream off the profitable routes, yet, under the Transport Act 1978, the Scottish Transport Group has a duty to break even, taking one year with another, after providing for the renewal of assets and establishing and maintaining a general reserve. There is only one way in which the group will be able to do that after the private operators move in and cream off the profitable routes, and that will be either by further reductions in services, both in urban and in rural areas, or by substantial increases in fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I expressed concern about the possible adverse effect of the Bill on concessionary fare schemes. I quote again from the Scottish Transport Group annual report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While concessionary fares schemes are primarily a matter for political resolution, the Group welcomed the proposals contained in the Government's Green Paper (Command 7475). Present schemes vary considerably both in form and extent. The relative cost of such schemes, however, may well vary from area to area according to population and travel patterns. Equally sensible are the provisions of the Transport Act 1978 on public service vehicle licensing. These recognise that there are areas where the social and welfare needs of a community cannot be wholly catered for within a predominantly market-based network without incurring a substantial cost penalty and the new legislation provides communities with the flexibility required to meet these needs insofar as they cannot be accommodated within existing conventional networks."</p></blockquote>
The private operators who will move in will have no regard for anything other than making a profit. The inevitable victims will again be the poorest sections of the community—the elderly, the handicapped, the poor and the disadvantaged. But, of
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
course, that is what Tory Party political philosophy is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency of Shettleston, the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive service No. 64 terminates at Auchenshuggle. For many years this has been one of the most lucrative routes in Glasgow, serving heavy industrial areas and busy shopping centres, running straight across Glasgow from east to west and through the busiest parts of the city. It will be a prime target for attack by private operators, especially during peak periods. If it becomes unprofitable, it and other routes will be at risk, and my constituents will suffer.

Two fairly large sources of employment in my constituency are Parkhead bus garage and Gartcraig bus garage, run by the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive. In addition, Baillieston bus depot of the Scottish Transport Group draws many of its staff from my constituency. In recent times, two GGTPE garages have been closed for good, namely, Partick and Bridgeton. Bridgeton garage was in my constituency and employed over 300 people. I am therefore, concerned about the effect of the Bill on my constituents and on other people throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary stated that there is a wide gulf between the two sides of the Committee in regard to clause 5. I could not agree more. The Conservative Party is clearly on the side of the entrepreneur out to make a fast buck, whereas we, the Opposition, are on the side of the people who have to depend on public transport for travelling to work, for shopping, for leisure and recreation, for education and for social purposes. That admirably sums up the difference between the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary, like his hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan), seemed to be making the point that too many groups or individuals should not be allowed to object,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
or to make representations to the traffic commissioners. This Government amendment does not alter the fact that it will be up to the traffic commissioners to decide which objections or representations are relevant, and to decide, therefore, whom they will hear. That could result in a situation arising whereby no objections or representations are considered—somewhat similar to the position that Opposition Members found themselves in when trying to make amendments at the beginning of the debate. Surely that is a negation of democracy.

To illustrate that, I have a friend who makes a habit of being a regular objector at hearings of the traffic commissioners. He is also a former employee of the Greater Glasgow passenger transport executive. He worked for over 20 years in transport and knows something about the subject. He takes a particular delight in appearing before the traffic commissioners and objecting to fare increases or to the lack of services which he believes should exist in his area. To bureaucracy and, perhaps to the elected members, he is a bit of a nuisance and a pain in the neck, but as he is very often the only objector at the hearing of the traffic commissioners, he performs a most useful function and at least keeps officials on their toes because they know that he will always be there.

As I said, he performs a most useful function and one which I would not like to see left to the traffic commissioners, as there is no doubt what their answer would be. His objection would not be relevant, or it would not be in the public interest, or there would be another reason why he would not be allowed to appear before them.</p>
	<p>To say that the Government are making only trifling changes, apart from the burden of thrift, must surely be a breach of the Trades Description Act. Clause 5 will have the most far-reaching effects on and consequences for transport for years to come.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) said, many Tory Members will be besieged by constituents who will have lost their public transport services.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall your advice to me this morning, Mr. English, to assume that members of the Committee recall decisions that they have taken on the previous clause.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
members of the Committee remember the decisions that they made on clause 1 of the Bill. One of the decisions was that the Bill has to be read as part of the 1960 Act. This of course has a special bearing on clause 5, which we have been discussing for some time now, and the amendments to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, we must bear in mind in trying to estimate the overall effect of this clause, that, amongst other things, the Bill repeals section 135(2) of the 1960 Road Traffic Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous amendment the Parliamentary Secretary drew our attention to some of the subsequent amendments to that section of the 1960 Act. Nevertheless, I urge the Committee to consider that what the Bill is doing, particularly by this clause, has to be looked at in that light. In particular, I urge hon. Members to have regard to the fact that we are wiping out a specific need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 135(2)(	<i>d</i>) of the Road Traffic Act 1960, when dealing with conditions which may be attached to licences, says that the commissioners shall have regard to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the needs of the area as a whole in relation to traffic (including the provision of adequate, suitable and efficient services, the elimination of unnecessary services and the provision of un-remunerative services). . ."</p></blockquote>
It has been envisaged in our law up to now that one of the roles of the traffic commissioner was to ensure that there should be provision for unremunerative services within the area for which he had to consider applications for road service licences—or at least that he should have regard for such provision. I suggest that that requirement has been eliminated, or if not eliminated, greatly devalued by the proposals in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may have been inadvertently misled in the notes circulated by the Minister in connection with the clause, because they refer to a particular requirement in the operation of clause 5 concerning consultations between the traffic commissioner and the authorities. Referring to the second provision of section 135 of the Road Traffic Act 1960, the note says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The second provision not re-enacted is the declaration in 136(3) that the duty imposed on the British Railways to provide certain services is not a matter to which the traffic commissioners are to have regard."</p></blockquote>
I read that section and I cannot see any reference in it to this duty. There might

be some misprint here. I am certain that it was not the intention of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If they are incorrect, it is not to be discussed. This is nothing to do with the clause. The clause is clear. We have discussed various amendments to it.

The right hon. Gentleman is confusing himself and thus confusing the Committee. It is replacing the word "replace" with the word "repeal".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am seeking to do that, but I am arguing that one can only objectively consider clause 5 if one looks at the changes that it is making in our existing law relating to this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of our existing law relating to this area is section 135 of the Road Traffic Act 1960, which is repealed by the Bill. I make no more of it than that, but I believe that when one sees it in that light—and I assume that it is intended by the Government to be seen in that light—one recognizes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
clause 5 of the Bill as threatening severely to weaken current provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1960 dealing with the granting of road service licences. That is the point on which I wanted to start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no safeguards contained in the clause to ensure that the requirements of the traffic commissioners will be standard in each traffic area. Given the changing responsibilities of the traffic commissioners under this legislation, that is a matter of some considerable importance, particularly in relation to road service licences since they will be operating on a narrower range and operating under different criteria and in slightly different ways from those which are envisaged in the existing legislation. I assume, with the repeals contained in the Bill relating to road service licences, that the commissioners will be free to decide what form the applications shall take and what information will be required—a matter which up to now we have not discussed. I suggest that the Committee might well be advised by the Minister on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite willing to help the right hon. Gentleman. If he wishes to discuss that subject now, I assume that he will not wish to discuss it again under clause 27.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. English. I want to discuss the subject now, strictly in relation to its effect on the granting of road service licences. The way in which the commissioners seek their information, or the way in which they decide on the form of application, has a direct and specific bearing on the issue of road service licences. It is that aspect, and that aspect only, that I want to mention briefly for the purpose of asking the Minister's advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from our previous debates that what we call an application for a road service licence in respect of a particular route may have to be a series of applications to a series of commissioners if the route runs through the areas of a number of commissioners. If I have understood the Bill correctly, a series of commissioners may decide quite freely to have different forms of application and to require different information. If that is correct, the Minister's own objective of simplifying the procedure will not be achieved; in fact, there may be additional complexity in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
whole system of the application for road service licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we place the clause in conjunction with clause 4(3)—and with clause 6(1), when we reach it, dealing, of course, with the conditions which can be attached to road service licences—it can be seen that, far from simplifying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>[MR. PAUL DEAN 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before our proceedings were rudely interrupted by the Division in the Chamber, and our attention was wrenched away from the fascinating provisions of clause 5 to a rather appalling act of the Government being discussed in the Chamber, I was contending that the clause 5 may have an effect entirely different from that which the Government seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that the Government are seeking where possible to simplify as well as to reduce the licensing provisions. I was contending that if the clause, taken with the repeals in the Bill to the Road Traffic Act 1960, will free the traffic commissioners to decide what form of information they require and what form of application they should take in order to determine a road service licence, some operators, or some people who are not operators but who are entitled to apply for road service licences, will have to apply not for one, but for two, three, four or more, according to the number of traffic commissioner areas through which the route for which they wish to apply runs. They might find themselves in effect making a whole series of applications in different forms and giving different particulars. If that is not the Minister's intention, if he intends to replace section 140 of the 1960 Act with another set of specific directions to commissioners as to how they should seek information, it would be useful if he would so inform the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I are opposed to the weighting in favour of the applicant as set out in the clause. However, I do not believe that we shall resolve the argument in that form. I shall therefore touch upon only one narrow aspect of it here, on which I think we may be able to make some progress. That is whether, given the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
Government's intention in the Bill, a standard form of application would better serve the Minister's purposes. If there is to be a weighting—and we accept that that is the intention of the Bill—would it not be easier to judge whether it was working in the way that the Minister intended if the applications were in standard form? If the applications vary from one set of commissioners to another, it will be extremely difficult in practice to work out whether the change of criteria or the weighting arrangements actually produce the results that the Minister now intends, and which, if the Bill is enacted without further amendment, will be the intention of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of the interests of the public in so far as they have to be taken into account by the road traffic commissioners in carrying out their duties under clause 5. I believe that the way in which those interests are defined here leaves them open to be interpreted very widely or quite narrowly. I do not doubt that it will suit the purposes of the Minister, and possibly many of his hon. Friends who support the Bill, to say that the public interest is here defined in such a way that increasing competition along certain passenger service routes is in the interests of the public, and one does not have to have regard to the fact that competition will tend to kill off some of the servicing of the unprofitable routes. The point was brought out in relation to some of the amendments, but I believe that it is relevant to the total consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is open to doubt whether, given the way in which the clause is framed, the traffic commissioners will consider applications at open hearings or behind closed doors. What are the Minister's views on that? As I read the clause, it is a matter entirely for the commissioners, and I think that we are entitled to take a view on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that the criteria governing the public interest are a matter for public interest. That flows from discussion on the clause and from contributions from hon. Members on both sides—we can also decide a commissioner should make his determinations and give his answers in public or whether he should do so behind close doors. There is a view of old of the traffic commissioner which suggests that he is an independent arbiter carrying out a semi-judicial function, in whom one has to repose a degree of trust, confidence and faith, or at least accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
that he will be a referee and that it is no use arguing over his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view him somewhat differently. I think that traffic commissioners are men who carry out a very responsible task and that it is important that those who make representations to them and live with their decisions should known something about the process of their thinking and how their decisions are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioners' view of the transport requirements as laid down in the clause may well vary from area to area and, of course, according to the transport policy pursued by different local authorities. I was interested in the contribution made by the hon. Member for Birmingham Yardley (Mr. Bevan) who showed a clear appreciation of this point. He clearly realises that if the commissioner is to have regard to the transport policy of the local authority he will have some difficult decisions to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local authority—in a democratic way and having due regard to the manner in which it will be spending taxpayers' and ratepayers' money and making arrangements with operators—has plunged a considerable amount of public money into a service on the assumption that it will be provided in a particular way, it then finds a traffic commissioner faced with an application which, if granted, will make the opposite assumption. The commissioner will have to stand as judge between the assumption underlying the democratic decision of the local authority and the interest of the applicant, and he will have to judge on the basis of what he considers is the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be an exceedingly difficult thing to do but I think it illustrates my argument. It might be worth while that when that kind of hearing is taking place it should be public and that people should know how these processes are being weighed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no mention in the clause of the need to provide and maintain the efficient service, the suitability of routes or the convenience of the disabled. That is covered in clause 6. Is that really the intention of this part of the Bill? In other words, is it the Government's intention that those factors should weigh in consideration under clause 6 but not under clause 5? If we can get a straight answer to that, we can discuss the matter further but the Bill, as drafted, is open to that interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
The proposals of the traffic commissioner in so far as they have regard to local authority policies and plans, should have to be considered whether they are drawn to the attention of the traffic commissioner by the local authority or by any other interested person. I readily accept that we have covered part of this in the amendment so I do not want to press the amendment. But under the 1978 Act there is no requirement for the local authority to consult or advise traffic commissioners of their proposals. There is a possibility that, under existing legislation, the traffic commissioners could act in ignorance of those proposals. That is a weakness of the present legislation which I would have hoped would have been put right in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also repeals the 1978 Act which required the taking into consideration of representations made by other persons providing transport facilities, or even district councils within the proposed routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I raised in an intervention has not been fully answered. If existing legislation specifically requires account to be taken of such representations and this Bill is enacted, thereby excluding that, is it not open to the courts to construe the action of passing the Bill as being one of Parliament requiring the commissioners to act in a different way, that is, requiring the commissioners not to take account of those people? If existing legislation requires their views to be taken into account, and this Bill removes that requirement, it is possible that the courts will take the view that Parliament did not want those people to be consulted or did not want their representations to be given weight by the traffic commissioner, at least to the extent that they are given weight at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it no higher than that, but if we can find some way of inserting into the Bill some indication to the courts that it is not the intention of Parliament that less weight should be given to those representations in the future than is the case at present, that would be a valuable addition to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also give further consideration to the way in which county councils are able to make their representations. Being politicians, we appreciate that there

can be differences of view as to what are the ideal PTPs for a county area as between one district council and another. That is why I am assured to some extent by the reference in the Bill to there being consideration of what borough or district councils actually say. This poses the question whether the borough or district councils will be merely informed, under subsection (5), or whether, as was indicated by the Under-Secretary when he was speaking to one of the amendments, they will be made aware when the commissioners are notified and will be in a position to make representations. If the borough or district councils within a county area are to be informed whenever the commissioners receive an application for a service that runs through their area, which is natural and proper, it is on the cards that a different view might be taken by them from that put by the TPP authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own constituency, Barrow-in-Furness, for example, was a county borough before the Local Government Act changed all that, and had a long history of running its own public transport services, back to the days when steam trams ran along the streets. It is not surprising, therefore, that the public representatives of Barrow have a clear idea of how public transport services should be run in their area. They do not necessarily coincide with the views of Cumbria county authority, which is now responsible for putting up TPPs. I should like the Minister, therefore, to give us some guidance. Does he see this specific provision as having a bearing on the matter? It seems that that must be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment, which seeks to insert "other" before "representations", was held by the Parliamentary Secretary to be of a little consequence. I do not necessarily agree with him, and I believe that he still has not answered my question on the amendment—whether the same point would be more easily achieved merely by altering the definition clause in the Bill to make clear that "representations" covered objections to other forms of representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it is clear, now that we have supported the Government on that amendment, that we are talking at least in similar terms when we refer to representations, and when we talk of objections as being representations and say that objections should be covered equally by notification, by right of representation. To

	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
that extent, a small improvement has already been achieved. However, the other issues that I have mentioned are more important, and we should hear the ministerial view on them before we determine whether the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has spent considerable time discussing the central principle of the clause—cross-subsidisation. It has become clear that there is a fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee. The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) pared the argument to the bone when he asked why people on profitable routes should pay more to subsidise those on less profitable routes. I shall come to the consequence of that argument soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is now becoming accepted that the principle of cross-subsidisation is involved here. While there has been some questioning of the cross-subsidisation principle, I feel that people are somewhat unfair if they assume that the argument about profitable versus unprofitable routes does away with the case for cross-subsidisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take, for example, a profitable route. The people who travel in the peak time will be getting their transport much cheaper than those who travel in the off-peak time, primarily because a large number of buses are needed to meet peak periods and the capital charges involved are greater. Therefore, those who want to travel by bus at 12 midday require a far smaller capital commitment than those who travel at peak periods. It is a classic economic situation and applies to most urban areas. Therefore, people who travel off-peak tend to subsidise peak travellers. Therefore one does not get away from the argument, in one form or another, about cross-subsidisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not apply in the case of the example cited by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. (Booth), where there is a service in the summer and a service in the winter. In the winter there may be no justifiable case for running the service at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my right hon. Friend's argument, which inevitably involves the idea of cross-subsidisation, is the maintenance of the network system as opposed to the routes. The honl Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan),
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
who is from the PTAs, knows that all passenger operators, particularly the PTAs, talk in terms of networks rather than routes. It would be impossible, in the large areas that those authorities serve, to talk solely of routes. By talking of networks one tends to talk largely of cross-subsidisation in routes, and also of cross-subsidisation in balancing the administrative expenses and other items involved in large bus undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause relates to the issuing of road service licences to bus operators to maintain their services. When the Parliamentary Secretary said that cross-subsidisation may not necessarily have been a difference between us and that it was a matter that could be considered by the commissioners in assessing the road service licence, our argument would be that the criteria laid down in the Transport Act 1960 for the commissioners in deciding whether a road licence should be issued—as under clause 5—are definitive about the conditions for public interest. Here we are repealing those sections. We assume that we shall not argue the repeal clauses when we reach them, and that we shall discuss the repealed sections relevant to the clauses as we discuss them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell on that matter, except to say that section 135 of the Road Traffic Act, relating to the conditions at present governing the commissioners' decision in granting a road service licence, covers some of the criteria laid down in the Bill. But, more important, it leaves out matters which are more relevant to our argument. For example, the first part of section 135 (2)(	<i>d</i>) considers the needs of the area as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 5 it is made clear that the areas as a whole are to be considered, and they are also to be considered by authorities planning the routes in transport plans, by county authorities, by PTAs, and by any other bodies who wish to make representations. But here the commissioners are told to take into account, when hearing representations, the rest of that section—which I understand is to be repealed—namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the elimination of unnecessary services and the provision of unremunerative services … and the co-ordination of all forms of passenger transport, including transport by rail".</p></blockquote>
In that they are to consider "the provision of unremunerative services", one can only assume that no operator will do that willingly unless he receives some form of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
subsidy or unless he cross-subsidises by a profitable route. Because the criteria contained those words, the cross-subsidisation argument was extremely relevant to the commissioners' consideration whether a road service licence would be given to an applicant, as dealt with under clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not deal with the other items of the criteria that are left out. The one relating to speed is interesting. Commissioners will no longer have to take into account whether offering a service between A and B may involve breaking the speed limit. That consideration is specifically taken out of the legislation. However, I shall not pursue that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend decides whether or not that is an argument to pursue in this context, I put it to him that it is quite common for commissioners, in looking at road service licences and such conditions as may be attached to them, to consider the timetable as well as the route, and the actual times between stops. If a commissioner were totally to ignore that, if he saw that there were two stops a mile apart and that only one minute was allowed in the timetable between them, would he not be condoning a breach of the law if he were to provide a licence which allowed an operator to work in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the Minister will answer, but presumably he will say that the commissioner is committing an offence and that there is other legislation to deal with that. But that, of course, was relevant to the 1960 Act, too, and it strengthened the commissioners' hand. The argument is relevant to the provision of service. It is not that an operator will be providing a service at 85 miles per hour for a bus service. Clearly, he can deal with that. It is the average speed that is relevant to these distances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that that was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary. I asked for a note from him because I was a little confused, because in looking through the piece of legislation I could not see that what was repealed. The gist of the note that I received was that it was not in the 1960 Act, but was amended by the 1978 Act, which put it in. Whether it was in the 1960 or the 1978 Act, the point that I am making—I may be wrong—assumes that the commissioner when assessing licences will take into account the criteria embodied in the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have it the wrong way round—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has got it the wrong way round. What was taken out by the 1978 Act was in fact the section that has been expressed in a totally different way. The quotation that he gave is something which had come out in the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that intervention. I tried to get information from the Parliamentary Secretary about the various repeals, but clearly I got it wrong. The point of the argument, of course, is the integration and co-ordination which is in all the pieces of legislation, which the commissioner has to take into account, and which is in the Bill. We consider the cross-subsidisation argument to be fundamental in the consideration of a network service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) made the point when he raised the issue of whether people operating a profitable route should be asked to subsidise those people who are not prepared to pay what I think was called the "going rate"—the profitable rate, or the proper fare for that particular service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>743</span>
The hon. Member for Faversham went on to make the point that those on the profitable routes suffer by this—presumably because where there is a profitable route the commissioner deliberately restricts the number of people who go on to that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, one of his conditions in considering the granting of a licence is the amount of services that are available on it. I can tell him that that is the thinking of the operators at present. They feel that if the Bill becomes law they will want to come off the unprofitable routes and concentrate on profitable ones. There will indeed be a better service on the profitable routes. I think that the point that the Minister makes is sound. It is not disputed on this side. There will be more bus services on profitable routes, giving a better service. Of that there is no doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman therefore reject the point that was made 	<i>ad nauseam</i> by his hon. Friend that those who would be coming on to the profitable routes would be what I think he referred to as the "sharks". The hon. Gentleman has just referred to the fact that the present operators would bring more buses on to the existing profitable routes, and by that he must include the National Bus Company on a very large scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the existing operators, very often, who will intensify and improve their services on the better routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the existing operators are likely to do that if they are faced with competition from others. The interesting point is why the operators say that. They say that they will increase routes to force the competitors out of business, because they will survive because of their size. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman particularly wants that situation in the long run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They say that they have the resources to be able to concentrate on a route. Anyone who attempts to undermine their position will be gradually squeezed out. We know that that is not an unusual process where there is a big operator and a small operator. We must wait to see what happens. It is not important to the argument at the moment except to say "Yes, there will be concentration on the profitable routes". That has always been an argument of this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the price will fall. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
could be another advantage to those on that particular route. The price may fall under competition, but our argument is that we are prepared to maintain a higher price structure in certain areas in order to maintain a network system. Such a system involves the principle of cross-subsidisation so we are quite prepared to say that people in those areas who offer to run those profitable routes may be asked to pay a little more in order to support a network service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say that that is the same for anyone on the principle of paying tax, and the application of the transport supplementary grant. Everybody contributes to that in the form of taxation. It is a grant that is given irrespective of whether anyone uses the service or not. This is a means by which we raise money from the community to pay for a network service that is not necessarily paid for by all the community—including taxpayers. That concept of a public service is what the Opposition believes in. We believe in maintaining a public, integrated service in the transport system. There have been difficulties on the rural side, largely because it has not been profitable for operators to go in. But if we did not have the cross-subsidisation principle—as we shall so readily learn when these clauses are passed and the Bill comes into effect—those rural services would have even less than they now have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel we are making progress and getting some common understanding. We have agreed that on the profitable routes we might have better and indeed cheaper services. As to the unprofitable routes, which the hon. Member says have been supported by cross-subsidisation, would he not concede that most of those routes exist today and have been supported—not by cross-subsidisation, which is minor element, because there is not much profit generated from the profitable routes—substantially by specific subsidies, because the losses have been identified on those services? His argument about cross-subsidisation is totally irrelevant to the survival of those routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as we can go slowly along the argument, I shall answer that point, as I have to do. In the argument on cross-subsidisation it is not simply a question of the profitable routes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
and the unprofitable routes, as the hon. Member has said. For example, in the Cornwall area, only 12 out of the 100 routes make a profit, according to the annual report. A total of 90 per cent. of the operations of the National Bus Company are in rural areas. It relies on other forms of income—the transport supplementary grant, which last year was approximately £21 million, received from local authorities—as contribution to its services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting point there, which I shall come to later, is that before the local authority gives it any money under those circumstances it expects the National Bus Company to separate its total costs and total revenue, so that the profits are used for the unprofitable routes. It is only on the difference between the cost and the revenue that the local authority make the contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One local authority at the moment imposes that principle of financing through the TSG. I think that it does the same with the PTAs. It is exactly the same principle. It is not marginal economic costing on routes, which is the suggestion behind the hon. Member's thinking. I shall come to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important obligations which I have referred to are not only the ones imposed on the Bill in the sense that the commissioners take them into account. One has to take into account the obligations on the National Bus Company, on the county authorities and the PTAs to provide a pleasant and integrated transport system. At the moment they do it on the basis of cross-subsidisation. If we do away with that principle, the corollary is to do away with the principle of the obligations on these authorities. This will clearly have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned that the difference reflected between us on the clause is fundamental. We believe in a network—as do the operators—but the Government policy is to see that the profitable routes are profitable and allow them to support themselves. The community would then have to make a decision about all the other bus services which are not profitable. It would contribute to their maintenance if it felt it was necessary to maintain them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that that principle, almost by definition, means that one will have to pay more for those services unless there is a massive reduction in the amount of bus
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
services. One cannot have the argument both ways. Cornwall was a good example and we were given a lot of examples, both on Second Reading and in Committee. The hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale), both in the Second Reading and in this Committee pointed to Cornwall as a means of showing the way forward. He told us that predominantly the system in Cornwall was privately operated, and said that that was a good example of how it worked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman take care with the description that I used? It is in the eastern part of Cornwall that transport is predominantly privately operated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quote the hon. Gentleman from a Second Reading debate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Predominantly the system in Cornwall is privately operated. Some say that that situation results from the historical refusal by Cornwall county council to put in greater sums by way of subsidy. Many hon. Members—especially Members of the Opposition—said that if subsidies were not available, the services were just not provided. Cornwall proves the case that these services will be provided by private operators."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1209.]</p></blockquote>
That is not in line with the evidence! The hon. Member has referred to the only evidence that we have on that matter; it is produced by his own county authority and his figures were, I presume, taken from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are wrong, I am prepared to look at it. I took the trouble to obtain a copy of the Cornwall report to see whether there was a secret in Cornwall which we did not know—where one could have private operators without subsidies, where the services could be maintained and we really could have a better system. I rest my case on the Cornwall evidence. It is here for any hon. Member to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of cross-subsidisation and it is relevant to the argument, as the Cornwall authority sees it, of providing services. The first point was that the public transport system provides 93 of the routes and the private 126. At first glance, it appears to be a predominantly private sector, but what are the facts concerning the number of passengers carried and the mileage travelled? It is not solely routes that determine a transport system. If we consider the number of passengers, the facts are that 12 per cent. of passengers making journeys in Cornwall were carried
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
by the private sector. Mileage covered by the private sector in this transport system was 7 per cent. That is hardly a predominance of the private sector in the Cornwall transport system—I am using only the figures from the Cornwall authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member presumably quoted from them but misled the Committee. It is right to say that there are more private routes but that is not the factor that determines a transport system, and it is the essential difference between the Government and the Opposition in determining and providing a regular integrated transport system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument about the basic predominance of the Western National Bus Company in Cornwall is true. The only problem is that in reality there is very little cross-subsidy. Out of the 80 or 90 prescribed routes in the last year, I think—18 months ago, the figures stuck in my mind—run by the Western National Bus Company, only three or four made a profit. Therefore, the whole operation is subsidised from one end of the county to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no use saying "Oh!". There is no way of getting out of that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have argued that the predominance is not correct. The other argument concerns the frequency of the service and the apparent frequency of those who offer services more than five times a week. The National Bus Company offers a service of more than five times a week—85 per cent. of its buses offer that kind of service. In the private sector only 40 per cent. offer anywhere near five times a week and its service has to be combined with picking up school children and acting as works buses, which, incidentally, the commissioner allows—certainly that area is not restricted in its use of the commissioner. Some of the profitable private buses apparently run once every two months, which is hardly the kind of integration we envisage in the Committee. It is all spelt out in the Cornwall report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Returns or singles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. From those frequencies, I assume that the report takes into account the profitable time when one might run a bus on a Saturday morning or market day, but it is hardly the public integrated system that we feel there should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the types of service, the National Bus Company in that area offers 46 per cent. rural bus services and 37 per cent, in town and inter-urban services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private bus service operates largely in the rural area and gives an 80 per cent. service. That reflects the point that the hon. Member made about the concentration between the east and the west on the bus services between the National Bus Company and the private operator. It is interesting to consider the point made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon). I was tempted to make a point about attendances, but I shall leave it there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have more sense than the hon. Member has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are not enough profitable routes to have effective cross-subsidisation. That is important. I mentioned earlier that 12 out of 93 routes on the National bus routes made a contribution to the profit of £110,000, again taking the county council's figures. But the losses are £670,000, and that has to come from revenue support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the private sector of 126 routes, 53 are making a profit. Presumably one of those running once every two months makes a profit. They receive a subsidy and revenue support of £77,000. Bearing in mind the scale of traffic with which they are dealing and the mileage they cover, there is no great gain by smaller subsidies being given to the private sector, except that in the private sector one does not have the profits from the profitable routes to offset the losses suffered in the other areas. It is easy to see that in that case it costs the community considerably more to carry that mix of loss-making and profitable sectors. It is no good the hon. Member for Faversham shaking his head. He should read the Cornwall report. He does not need to take my word for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was listening to the figures quoted by the hon. Member, and his case does not add up. He said that there was a subsidy of £77,000 paid to the private operators who carry 12 per cent. of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
passengers. A £670,000 subsidy was paid to the National Bus Company. If he relates those two figures he will see that that is a pretty dismal picture. If the £670,000 subsidy was offered to private operators, they might just as well be operating the same service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever contribution is made to the profitable service is being offset against the losses. The amount given by the authority in revenue support takes into account the offsetting of profits and losses. It is the difference between the costs and the revenue that determines the amount of support that comes from the local authority. So whatever the amount—be it £5,000, £10,000 or £110,000—it is less that amount that the community has to find, by definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By maintaining a network system, the community has to pay whatever system is involved. I shall use the conclusion of the hon. Member for Cornwall, North because North Cornwall has been seen as one of the areas that can show the way to the rest of us, but it is not the kind of transport system that we believe we should have in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by quoting from the Cornwall county council report for 1979–80, which deals with revenue support grant. Paragraph 42 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The other extreme of paying no revenue support grants would result in the collapse of any reasonable county-wide service, and real deprivation as far as transport is concerned for those without access to private cars for their journeys."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the point that we have been making.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only 12 of the Western National's 93 routes are profitable and the company could probably do no more than run a small number of basic trunk routes to and from Penzance, Camborne/Redruth, Truro and Falmouth. This would leave almost all the country villages uncovered by Western National, certainly in peak times, and possibly result in no Western National services east of Truro. Private operators would move in to pick up the most remunerative journeys on the remaining routes and abandon the rest. This would also lead to a massive increase in the school transport bill because school contract prices would have to rise to bring in as much to the operator as the most lucrative alternative stage services he could run. The prospect of a massive loss in services is completely unacceptable and the County Council will thus continue to provide financial assistance to cover the difference between actually incurred expenditure including proper provision for asset replacement and passenger receipts."</p></blockquote>
That is the alternative to a network system maintained on a cross-subsidisation principle and that is why we are opposed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
the clause and to the Bill. It could not have been said better than by the Cornwall authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some trepidation following the excellent disquisition by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) on the circumstances prevailing in Cornwall, North—and possibly Cornwall, South for that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the clause is fundamental to the concept which the Government are trying to introduce, in particular to the question of shifting the onus of proof. I do not want to dwell on that point at any great length, but want to return to the question of cross-subsidisation. I shall try to follow the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East without repeating them 	<i>ad nauseam.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we must accept the point made by some Conservative Members that the degree of cross-subsidisation within the bus industry is not of paramount importance to the future of rural services because it is a much smaller sum than the subsidies provided directly by taxpayer and ratepayer, we must all bear in mind that immense pressures have been brought to bear to reduce those direct contributions by the taxpayer and the ratepayer.

Therefore it is no good the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) saying "Never mind about the internal cross-subsidies within the bus industry; if we want our non-paying rural services subsidised, they ought to be clearly and identifiably subsidised by the public". We know and his constituents know that the Government of whom he is a supporter and the Kent county council—if that is the right county—are both dead set on reducing the subsidies upon which the hon. Member for Faversham says the villagers in his constituency will have to rely for their rural services which do not pay. All the members of the Committee will have to remember that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good talking about the marginality of the cross-subsidy within the bus industry if in some counties, partly as a result of Government action and even more as a result of action by Conservative-led county councils, the internal subsidy within the bus industry will soon be the only one available in some counties, because the other, direct forms of subsidy are being withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, however, that there is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
considerable amount of cross-subsidy within the bus industry, as can be seen from the profits, and consequently the distribution of those profits, from profitable routes to non-profitable routes—within the publicly-owned sector of the industry anyway—because that is the only place to which the profit from the profitable routes go. It goes on other services. Consequently, if there are reductions in those profits, that aspect of cross-subsidisation will disappear or at least be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I shall return, not to any part of the document produced by the National Union of Railwaymen that has been referred to already, but to a different path. I raised the question of North Cornwall, and I think that the points made in the document were borne out reasonably well by the figures provided by the Cornwall county council's document. I picked on the Derbyshire routes because they were relevant to the previous occupant of the Chair, Mr. Dean, and to the Parliamentary Secretary. But having looked at those routes, which we are warned by the NUR branches in that area will be threatened, I thought that I should draw the Committee's attention to one particular route, especially as the hon. Member concerned, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), is not with us following his serious and unfortunate accident. The document says that, according to the NUR Chesterfield East Midland Branch, among the services likely to be withdrawn are those that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"would mean that the direct link between Doe Lea, Glapwell, Bolsover, Shuttlewood, Bentinck, Woodthorpe, Staveley, Barrow Hill and New Whittington would disappear leaving passengers to make long journeys and change buses to reach their destinations".</p></blockquote>
I can see that the Minister might countenance the withdrawal of all sorts of services, but I think that if he values uninterrupted speeches in the House in future, he should at least take care to protect the service to Bolsover, particularly if he is trying to do away with it by stealth in the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover. At this point, we should say that we all send him our best wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point should be borne in mind on the question of local bus services and cross subsidies. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) in an excellent speech on the amendments, referred to the likelihood
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
of Conservative Members going barmy in a few years' time because large numbers of their rural services had been withdrawn. That reminds me of the process that was started by Dr. Beeching with the assistance of the anti-railways officials of the Department of Transport, when they set about decimating the country's transport system. At that time the Beeching cuts were strongly favoured by large numbers of Conservative Members. But it was not long before they, reflecting the views of their constituents, started making all sorts of representations about the loss of particular lines. So there is likely to be in this case also an acceptance by those on the Government Benches of the general principle of the Bill, particularly clause 5, but an unwillingness to accept the consequences to services in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to North Devon. In a previous incarnation, if that is the right word, I went to speak at an entirely non-political meeting in Bideford. I was later taken to a dinner party by people who seemed to have two or three cars each.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But the thing that stuck in my mind above all was the absolute obsession of those people—who were better off and less dependent on the railways—about the withdrawal of the railway service that formerly ran from Barnstaple to Bideford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Devon, North (Mr. Speller) is not on the Committee, but no doubt the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) will oblige by reminding his hon. Friend of the great disgruntlement that has arisen in many rural areas about the loss of rural railway lines. I believe that we shall see a similar process take place.

They were shooed into providing those services. They had no problems in providing the service that was to parallel the railway being eliminated. They had no problems convincing the traffic commissioners. It was made easy for them. In many instances they provided the services. However, as the NUR in Cornwall pointed out, when the Western National withdrew its services the entrepreneurs moved in. Because there was not enough money to be made, large numbers of them moved quickly out.

That will characterise the response to the proposals in the Bill which, in essence, are provided for in clause 5 and in one or two other clauses. For that reason, I hope that some Tory Members representing rural areas will see the error of their ways and recognise that what they are doing is likely to damage a considerable number of their constituents—in particular, those constituents in rural areas who do not have access to private transport. The elimination of public transport for those who do not have private transport will mean enormous difficulties, especially for those trying to reach their places of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members—although I cannot expect them to join with us in trying to vote the clause down—will make representations to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary in an effort to make them reflect a little further on some of the aspects of the clause so that its faults can be put right on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that most of the points in the clause have been covered in our lengthy debate on the main amendments. The clause determines the way in which road service licensing will operate in future. Our purpose, as declared in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
much-debated clause 1, is to make it easier for applicants to obtain road service licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some reason I seem to have had the effect of emptying the Opposition Benches. I cannot understand the reason for the sudden exit. I am sure that that means that the Opposition are now determined to make rather quicker progress than previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we believe that this is a way to breathe new life into the bus industry and to meet the real needs of the travelling public. Much of the debate we have had—several hours upon the amendment—contains two profound mistakes on the part of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen. That was clearly shown in the last speech before we adjourned from the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). First, he seemed to assume that revenue support cannot concontinue by some strange means under the Bill. Of course it can and will continue. The second mistake, and it is an error which both he and his hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) made, is to imagine that cross-subsidisation cannot continue. Of course it can continue. But it is a need that must be established and proved. Cross-subsidisation, when it is established and proved, is one of the factors that traffic commissioners can and will take into account in making their decisions. I shall return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key change is that where an application for grant of licence is made to the traffic commissioners they shall grant such a licence unless they are satisfied that to do so would be against the interests of the public, not just against their own interests. I should have thought that was a general principle that the public would support. The interests of the public are paramount to us. The presumption is that they are better served by granting rather than by restricting licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much talk about criteria. But there is just one criterion—the public interest. In replacing the list of relevant matters in the 1978 Act with the shorter list which we have in the clause, my deliberate aim has been in no way to restrict or to reduce the scope of the argument before the traffic commissioners about whether a proposed service is against the public interest, but to leave it as wide as possible. In direct reply to the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
Booth) that means that the disabled and organisations representing the disabled, the borough and district councils and other organisations can put their points of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have pruned the list, but we have not pruned the scope for people to put their point of view. I hope that county councils in particular will take a full part in the argument and always put the public interest first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central point of the debate has been cross-subsidisation. Shifting the burden of proof means that operators will have to satisfy the commissioners that new services will affect cross-subsidisation in a way that would be detrimental to the public interest. That was what my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) was saying. He said that those people who seek to establish that there is cross-subsidisation should have to prove their case. I should have thought that that was reasonable. We can all claim that cross-subsidisation takes place. There have been many such claims. I take the view that it can take place sometimes, service to service perhaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The typical example in many cases is not the service-to-service cross-subsidisation, but internal cross-subsidisation. That is to say, the profitable part of a day on a service subsidises the other part. All we ask is that cross-subsidisation claims are established to be correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that may not be easy, but the need to examine and justify their patterns of subsidisation will, in my view, be a healthy discipline for operators. Thus it is open to the commission to decide that the benefit to some travellers of an additional bus service down a busy High Street is outweighed by the likely loss of vital revenue to an operator cross-subsidising unprofitable services from the receipts of his existing High Street service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally it is open to the commission to decide that although a new service might take some passengers away from an existing operator on one part of the route, it is more important that the new service should</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan), who has the dubious distinction of being a constituent of mine in the West Midlands, that county councils will clearly have an important role under the clause.</p>
	<p>Although I am doubtful about the elaborate structure of plans and procedures with which county councils have been burdened since the 1978 Act—and no doubt my hon. Friend shares that view—I am convinced of the importance of their public transport responsibilities. Their view of how the transport needs of the electorate can best be met and their decisions in consultation with operators about where to direct financial support, will be important evidence for the commission.</p>
	<p>If counties are concerned about cross-subsidisation, they will be able to argue the case. They are in a position to take a broad view of public interests and I hope that they will do just that. My hon. Friend knows that we will also be tackling an issue on which he feels strongly—namely, fare control, and I share his concern.</p>
	<p>I believe that what we are proposing is sensible and that the fears that have been expressed are exaggerated. The clause is important and I urge the Committee to accept it.</p>

	<p>12.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 8, line 32, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The commissioners shall exercise their powers under subsection (3) only after obtaining and considering objections and other representations from the bodies notified under section 5 of the original grant of the licence."</p></blockquote>
The amendment stands in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and myself. If members of the Committee do not like the wording, all we can say is that it is a poor thing but our own. However, we believe that the principle embodied in the amendment is important. If the Minister feels that it goes too far in calling on commissioners to obtain and consider objections and representations for every minor variation in conditions, I am sure that the Opposition would be happy to</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>
"(5) Compliance with any condition attached to a road service licence under this section may be temporarily dispensed with by the traffic commissioners by whom the licence was granted if they are satisfied—
	<ol>
	<li>that compliance with the condition would be unduly onerous by reason of circumstances not foreseen when the condition was attached or, if the condition has been altered, when it was last altered; and</li>
	<li>that such a dispensation would not be against the interests of the public." [	<i>Mr. Fowler.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>accept his undertaking that he would produce an appropriate—if possibly slightly less restrictive—amendment on Report.</p>
	<p>We believe that it is an important point. During the discussion of clause 5, great emphasis was placed by both sides of the Committee on the need for thorough consultation and for the public and various bodies to be informed to enable them to make representations to the traffic commissioners about an application, so that their views and the facts that they brought to their attention could be put and properly considered before the commissioners decided two matters. The first is whether to grant a licence, and the second is whether conditions should be imposed in it.</p>
	<p>The point that we wish to make, and which we believe should be covered in the Bill, is that some of the conditions that can be made are of sufficient importance that it would be ludicrous to allow the licensee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>759</span>
to re-apply for some of those conditions to be changed or—as I understand the clause as drafted—for the commissioners to dispense with licence conditions of their own volition without any further process of consultation.</p>
	<p>Again referring back to clause 5, which is the only way that I can illustrate what I am talking about, I note that a large number of bodies must be informed when the application for a licence has been received. Although it will not be in the Act but in regulations that the Minister has promised, publicity will be given to that receipt of applications and people will be able to make representations about them. The commissioners will then consider those representations or objections and decide whether to issue a licence. If they do, they may impose conditions.</p>
	<p>When they grant a road service licence, the traffic commissioners will send notice of it, together with details about it, to a number of bodies that are interested in the provision of public service transport in the area concerned. Therefore all those organisations will be aware of the conditions under which the licence has been granted.</p>
	<p>No doubt some of them will be satisfied that the licence is suitable and will be happy that the commissioners have taken into account the representations that they have made because certain conditions are included in the licence. But if those conditions can be dispensed with without any process of consultation that seems to us to make the whole system quite absurd.</p>
	<p>We are prepared to recognise, as is pointed out in the notes on clauses that the Minister kindly provided, that to insist on some form of notification for every minor change that is made would cause a great deal of trouble. Examples are given of such absurdities as moving a stop 20 yards down a road or a minor timetable change of a couple of minutes, and I believe that we can all see that such changes should not be notifiable changes even under the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend and me.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, it seems that there should be an obligation on the commissioners and not just an option open to them, if they are to have regard to the public interest, to seek the views of the public and major bodies when they intend making a major licence variation. Again, the notes on clauses suggest that that can be covered but only by the voluntary initiative of the traffic commissioners. But I do not believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
that many members of the Committee want to leave very much—certainly in the way of consultation with the public.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I am sorry, but I have said this before. I will try to explain to the Committee why I will not have the notes on clauses brought into the discussion. I regard it as being of great assistance to Members of the House of Commons when notes of that type are produced. If they are produced and are used in the sort of way in which they have been used, the blunt truth is that they will not continue to be produced. Therefore, I believe that the hon. Gentleman, although he may not realise this, is really attacking something that many of us have struggled for years to achieve. The notes are provided for information to members of the Committee. They are not part of the Bill. The Bill is before us, there are amendments before us, and the hon. Member is allowed to discuss them. The notes on clauses are provided to assist him and not to be criticised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. English, and have noted that the provision of such notes must have been a great breakthrough as a result of pressure from a substantial numbers of hon. Members over the years to get them to hon. Members other than Ministers during the Committee stage of a Bill. Certainly, it was not my intention, but must have been due to my poor presentation, if what I said could have been in any way interpreted as an attack on the contents of the notes on clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I was hoping to make was that, while I accept that under clauses 5 and 6—this is highlighted by the very helpful notes on clauses—the traffic commissioners will have the right if they wish, but only if they wish, to consult interested parties about major changes in licence conditions which they have been asked to make by a licence holder, or which they want to make of their own volition, they are under no obligation to do so. I would like to see an obligation for them to do so inserted in the Bill. It was for that reason that my hon. Friend and I proposed the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that there is general agreement on both sides of the Committee that none of us is particularly keen to leave the matter of deciding whether to consult the public to the discretion of the traffic commissioners. Whilst they have certain respon-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
sibilities to the Ministry, and the Ministry has responsibilities to the House of Commons when dealing with appeals, generally speaking I think that everyone acceps that they are appointees, transport quangos, or whatever one likes to call them, and none of these appointed bodies, as opposed to democratically-elected bodies, has been too hot on consulting people about things that they do. Therefore, the more obligations that we actually impose upon them, either by statute or by regulation, to ensure that the necessary consultation takes place, the better. That would provide a protection for the public and for the constituents of all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is particularly the case in view of the change in the onus of proof. That change went through on clause 5, so it is likely to become law. There is also what might be described as a change in the onus of proof in clause 6. The licence-holder seeking a variation in conditions will not have to prove that the change will benefit the public. It will be up to the traffic commissioners to satisfy themselves that the change is not to the benefit of the public. It is, therefore, important that people should be allowed to make representations and that those affected by major changes should have the right to make representations against those changes, the better to help the traffic commissioner to assess the importance of the consequences of any deletion of licence conditions which may arise, and consequently to assess whether there will be an adverse impact on the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that that is wholly in line with the spirit of clause 5, which now stands part of the Bill, as well as of clause 6, and can only serve to improve and strengthen protection for the public from the Bill. I hope that the Ministry will therefore accept our proposal. As I have said, the amendment was drafted rather hurriedly and in its present form it would not allow the commissioners to make minor changes without going through a whole rigmarole of consultation. We accept that they ought not to be obliged to do that, but I hope that the Ministry will be able to accept the broad principle of the amendment and to bring forward on Report an amendment which will oblige the traffic commissioners to consult on major variations in conditions rather than merely having the option to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
If the Minister will undertake to do that, I am sure that we can get on to the clause 6 stand part debate straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful to the Committee if I respond straight away. Clearly, we fully understand the concern of the hon. Gentlemen and of the Committee that all relevant interests should have a chance to make representations before the licence is varied. I think that that is basic, and I entirely agree with most of what the hon. Gentleman said. I think that we can certainly help him in what he seeks to do, and I hope to give a reply that will totally satisfy him and meet all the points that he has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the current regulations, the traffic commissioners are required either to publish a notice of a proposal to vary a licence in notices and proceedings, or to give notice of the proposal to such other persons as it appears to them may be affected. That is the requirement under current regulation PSV licences and certificates regulations 1952. That allows wider consultation than under the proposed amendment because it allows the consultation of the operators. The Minister and I will continue in that particular way.

I should, however, like to give an undertaking that the principle of taking into account objections and representations will be retained in the regulations to be made under the Bill. These regulations—and this is the crunch point as far as the hon. Gentleman is concerned—will make it clear, as they do at the moment, that traffic commissioners must consider any objection or representations received before reaching a decision on a variation. There is, first, the obligation of notification and, secondly, I give an undertaking that the traffic commissioners must consider any objections or representations received before reaching a decision on a variation. I should have thought that with my second undertaking the hon. Gentleman would feel that the points he raised have been answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear what the Minister is saying about the existing law which will be carried forward, and the new undertaking that he has given. I follow that there will be an obligation to consider representations or objections made but I am not quite sure whether there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
would be an obligation to invite them in the first place. Without that obligation to invite objections or representations there would be no need for an obligation to consider them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The current regulations require traffic commissioners either to publish a notice of a proposal to vary a licence or to notify the interested parties. That is the current state of play. I give an undertaking that the new regulations made under the Bill will retain that requirement in principle. I also assure the Committee that operators and local authorities will be consulted as to the precise form of the new regulations. I hope that meets the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my right hon. Friend for that assurance, which I am certain will help tremendously. While the erstwhile proposed amendment does not appeal to me, it represents a change, a deviation from that which has happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fear that I am expressing is that subsection 3(	<i>a</i>), as it stands, whereby the traffic commission can alter
	<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as they think fit having regard to the interests of the public, any condition attached to the licence"</p></blockquote>
when applied, for instance, to subsection (1), the last portion of which states
	<br><blockquote><p>"including persons who are disabled"</p></blockquote>
will give rise to certain fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the last person to wish that assistance should not be given to the disabled. In my time, I was the first chairman of the social services committee in Birmingham. However, this point again hinges on the powers that are open to the traffic commissioners. Those powers, if wrongly interpreted by the traffic commissioners, could be extremely dangerous for the large operator and could be inimical in their effect upon the operation of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, a particular traffic commissioner could, by virtue of the clauses I have mentioned, ask for special buses or other vehicles to be provided as part of the granting of the licence, or could ask for a certain number of uneconomical seats to be given over and permanently retained for the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us in the Committee have, I am certain, a great conception of compassion
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
and humanity for the disabled. Nevertheless, we wish to ensure that a traffic commissioner, by virtue of a particular foible or for a particular reason, would not attach such conditions, particularly in regard to the disabled, which could endanger an operator, especially a large operator. Therefore, I appeal to my right hon. Friend again to lay out, if he can, certain parameters and regulations when he attaches regulations further to the Act to ensure that they are not utilised in such a manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I am in some difficulty, because I had intended to talk about the disabled, but I thought that it would be more appropriate to do so on "clause stand part" than on the amendment. Would you give your ruling?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentlemen is perfectly right, but I took it that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) was merely using the subject as an illustration at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty, Mr. English, in rising to support the amendment. It appeared to me that the Minister was accepting it without necessarily writing it into the appropriate clause. It seems ludicrous that he can accept a principle in good faith and say on the other hand that he cannot accept the amendment. The amendment is so simple that that attitude is ludicrous. All it seeks to do is to provide that, under clause 5, there should be consultation, and that people have the right to express a point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepts that principle, perhaps he will tell me why he cannot write the amendment into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I tried to say. The hon. Gentleman must recognise that by the amendment he would narrow the number of people who are being consulted rather than increase it. If we leave the matter, as I suggest, under the current regulations, a great number of people—mainly operators—could be consulted. That is more than the amendment would permit. We are not only taking on board the spirit of what the hon. Gentleman is saying but going further. I should have thought that that was helpful to him, rather than the opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>765</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point, but I do not quite understand what he is getting at. The amendment specifies
	<br><blockquote><p>"other representations from the bodies notified under section 5".</p></blockquote>
Is he telling me that there is now a wider implication than that? If he is, I shall be pleased to hear it. Can he tell me categorically that there is wider representation than
	<br><blockquote><p>"the bodies notified under section 5"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is exactly what I sought to do. If the hon. Gentleman looks at clause 5, he will see that it does not include operators, which regulations would do. Under the current regulations a wider consultation is allowed because operators are included. The hon. Gentleman will see if he looks at clause 5 that the operators are not included. I do not want to make a meal of this, but I should have thought that we are being helpful to him rather than not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the right hon. Gentleman is saying that our amendment does not go far enough. In fact, the law in the Bill is there. On the other hand, he accepts the principle and says that the Bill goes further than the amendment goes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I think that the confusion has arisen because the law includes Acts of Parliament and regulations—statutory instruments, to use the more correct term. As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the statutory instruments go wider. If the hon. Minister looks in the Official Report he will see that the Minister said that the Bill goes wider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only question at issue is whether one wants something in the Bill, or whether one wants it in regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English, that is the nub of the situation. Does the Bill go wider?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the mechanics, the fact is that the hon. Minister is refusing to take "Yes" for an answer. If he goes on doing that—it is the second time this evening—it will discourage the Government from being helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never been known to refuse to take "Yes" for an answer. Unfortunately, the right hon. Gentleman has his own point of view, but "Yes" with qualifications is not " "Yes". If the Government were to mean "Yes", full stop, that would be different. But I was told "Yes, but".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the right hon. Minister for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) intended to be helpful. The follow-up to his intervention was not helpful. Could the hon. Minister address himself solely to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. English, but I have been so diverted from the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not wish a dissertation from the hon. Member. I wish him to address himself solely to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it for me to give a dissertation, but I was going on a full point and was then diverted. I will not divert again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Minister saying "Yes, this is covered". If he is prepared to say that, why will he not put the amendment into the Bill? If he says that it is covered, accepting the amendment would doubly cover it. If it is covered by similar legislation, there is no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, we have already gone through that argument before. All the arguments were deployed about whether it should or should not be in the Bill, whether we should, or should not, do it by regulation. I do not see that there is anything to add to those arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing is making a valid point. We are seeking to help the hon. Member, and are giving undertakings on all the points on which he wants undertakings. Indeed, we are going further than he seeks to do. In the give and take of a Committee that is taking transport policy seriously, we should get some credit for doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fair enough. Undertakings are one thing. The problem that we have time and again concerns when the Bill becomes an Act. I believe that one of the Conservative Members opposite—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am very sorry. If I may say so, the Minister has slightly encouraged this situation himself, but I will not have on the subject of the rather limited scope of the amendment a major discussion on the value, or otherwise, of the Government's undertakings. We are discussing an amendment, and if hon. Members are not proposing to discuss it, we will finish the amendment and proceed on to something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem, Mr. English, because on the one hand the Government give undertakings, but when we move from here, the undertakings—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry. That is a perfectly good subject to discuss on Second Reading, Third Reading, or anywhere else but here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, on my reading, deals with the way in which the commissioners exercise their powers under subsection (3)—not under subsection (1). Subsection (1) refers to the regulation making—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need to specify it if it is not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to show my hon. Friends who tabled the amendment how it is relevant to the Minister's reply. The Minister said that their point could be covered by regulation-making powers. The regulation-making powers apply to subsection (1), and they are clearly powers to attach conditions on the granting of a licence. The amendment does not deal with the powers to attach original conditions. It deals with the power to remove the conditions originally attached or to attach a subsequent or additional condition. Therefore, I think that to say, as the Minister does, that it can be dealt with by regulations means that it could be argued that the regulation-making power was not intended to deal with this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, there are merits, as we have said before, in stating in the Bill where we desire to have the right to be consulted and notified. If we accept, as I hope we do, that we are discussing important conditions—essential matters within the condition-making powers of the commissioners over this aspect of the road service licence— it is fair to argue that one can and should
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
state within the clause the duty of the commissioners to exercise those powers in a specific way, and only after they have considered objections and representations from bodies notified under clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not challenge the Minister's contention that the power to make regulations can be interpreted in that way, but we are dealing with a power given by the 1960 Act. It is contained, as we have been reminded by the Minister, not only in section 160 but in section 158 of the Act. It is a power to make regulations on the procedure for applications for licences. Presumably that is being interpreted so widely as to cover the procedures for dealing with the changes of conditions attached to licences. If not, the Minister is relying on a much wider power given at the beginning of section 60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is better to be clear and specific about who is to be consulted. If the Minister's argument, to which we listened with great care, and to which we attach importance, is that he would want to see a wider range of consultation and a wider right to make objections than that covered by the amendment, will he be prepared to put down a later amendment to ensure that that will happen? Or he could table an amendment to provide that regulations will be made in relation to subsection (3) to provide for a wider intention than that sought in amendment No. 134.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. That must go into the Guinness Book of Records as the longest intervention that we have ever known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help hon. Members if they began to realise that we are in Committee and that they can, subject to closures and other such things, speak as many times as they wish. In Committee, interventions are unnecessary. They have a use in the House because hon. Members cannot speak more than once. I took that as a speech. If the hon. Member wishes to make another speech, he is entitled to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English, for that point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, Mr. English, I take your ruling. We disagree on this issue. On the one hand, the Minister seems to be agreeing with the amendment—I

	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
shall restrict myself to the amendment—and says "I shall do that by regulation".—If the regulation were before the Committee we should be able to discuss it, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the Minister said that it was already done by regulation. Then I must regretfully inform the hon. Gentleman that the law of the land is automatically assumed to be before the Committee. If hon. Members have not read it, that is their problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. That poses the problem that if the regulation is before the Committee now it does not meet the point of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I understood you to say that we would debate the merits of the amendment as against doing it by regulation, but only the merits of the amendment as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Cowans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit lost there, because I do not know what the right hon. Gentleman is talking about. He seemed to ask for a ruling from you, Mr. English, and you seemed to say that we are in order. The problem is that the regulation the Minister is talking about does not seem to meet the amendment. That is the dilemma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is straining this point too far. Does he wish to argue that his amendment should be in the Bill? If he does, he is perhaps unwise to impugn the suggestion that it is not already in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we are in some difficulty. On the one hand, the Minister says that what is in the Bill goes wider—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, what is in the regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, the regulation goes wider. But we do not accept that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
regulation goes as wide as our amendment. That is the whole purpose of the amendment. [	<i>Hon Members:</i> "Oh".] For goodness' sake, if the Minister can produce something that tells us categorically that the regulation goes wider than the amendment, I am prepared to accept it, but at the moment I do not think that it covers the point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand the Minister says that the regulation goes wider. Will he intervene and say how and why it goes wider? Because that is the point of the amendment. We must press the amendment, because we do not believe that the regulation which the Minister is talking about goes as wide as the amendment. I am sorry, but until the Minister can convince us that it does, we must press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to press his amendment, that is a matter for him. Anyone who has listened to this debate with half an ear will have realised that the assurances that I gave were assurances that any Opposition looking seriously at the Bill and wanting to make progress upon it would have accepted. The regulation-making power comes from section 158 of the 1960 Act, not from clause 6(1), as I think the right hon. Gentleman was suggesting. I can only repeat that under the current regulations the traffic commissioners are required either to publish a notice of a proposal to vary a licence or to give notice of the proposal to such other person as it appears to them may be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat again that this in fact allows wider consultation than the amendment would. That is for the very simple reason that it allows and includes consultation with operators, something that is not included under the amendment. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to argue that the provision should be part of the Bill rather than being effected by regulation, that is a matter for him. Our case is not only that it is already done better in the way that I have described, but also that that is the sensible way of doing it. Anyone who listened objectively to the arguments would be convinced by them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is principally concerned with a range of powers of traffic commissioners—powers to attach conditions when granting road service licences, and also, as we saw clearly from the amendments, to remove or vary those conditions. The conditions are mainly those which do not relate to fares. Interesting issues are raised about how the traffic commissioner performs his duty in view of the relationship between the conditions and the provisions of the original licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to illustrate that by reference to only one of the conditions that can be attached, namely, the condition concerning the route. I understand, that as the clause is drafted, the actual route travelled by vehicles subject to a road service licence may be prescribed by a condition. Therefore, under the provisions of the clause it can be varied. On the other hand, the actual route need not be a condition; it may be an original provision of the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right about that, in a case where the route was an original provision of the licence rather than a condition attached to it, an operator—or the person who had originally obtained the road service licence and arranged for someone else to operate it—who wanted to change his route would presumably have to apply for another road service licence. When the Minister replies to the "clause stand part" debate, I should like him to confirm whether I am right in that reading of the Bill. If so, why is the Bill drafted in this way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that a minor change in the route would be made because if the route were obstructed by roadworks or some other changes it would be nonsensical to go through a total road service grant procedure. But, if major changes in the route are to be made, it seems to me to be going rather further than conditions which should be attached under the clause. The clause does not seem to place any limit on the extent to which variations of conditions
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
can be variations of route. That is a point that we have not discussed under the only amendment we have considered and therefore it is one that I should like to raise here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause the commissioners may make conditions about the safety and convenience of disabled people. My hon. Friends and I are anxious that commissioners should have this duty in mind when they attach conditions to licences. Our recent history of the operation of legislation in relation to disabled people is not entirely happy, but local authorities, who now have responsibilities under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act, and who also have responsibilities for passenger transport policies, are responding to views expressed in the House about the importance of regarding people who suffer from physical disabilities as being no less part of the public than people who do not. If there are public buildings into which a person with a physical disability cannot go, or if bus services are operated in such a way that disabled people cannot use them, it is wrong to regard those as good or proper public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important provision and I hope that the Minister will make clear that he wants to see it used positively by commissioners to ensure that public bus services operate in a way which enables them to be used by disabled people. I contend that in very many instances the whole scope of activity of a disabled person depends on suitable transport provisions, determining whether he can work, pursue studies or have a social life. It is an important part of the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate we had on the amendment goes to the heart of one of the difficulties. If it were possible to have a condition removed, a condition upon which some disabled person depended to enable him to use a transport service, that would be an important change which should not take place without every opportunity for those who felt strongly about the issue of mobi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
lity of disabled people to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When commissioners vary conditions they must have regard, as I understand it, to the transport requirements of the area as a whole. I believe that the commissioners, on any reasonable reading of the clause, would have to consider objections by local authorities and representations made to them on the basis of their plans. But I do not see anything in clause 6 which tells us whether the commissioners would need to have a sitting to consider these or whether he would have to publish. I understand that this is to be covered by regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the important role of existing regulations and future regulations on the operation of the clause. It seems that what the Minister was saying on the amendment, that because this clause will have to operate as a section within the 1960 Act, it will be subject to regulations already made under the 1960 Act. If I am wrong, I hope that the Minister will make it clear. If the Minister is saying that when this Bill is enacted regulations made under the 1960 Act dealing with the attachment to road service licences regarding conditions other than fares conditions will automatically apply to this clause, that seems strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems strange that when we have a clause in this Bill which is different from the existing section in the 1960 Act dealing with the attachment of road service licence and conditions, we can be confident that the regulations made under the previous legislation are automatically applicable in this case. We should have some guidance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister holds that the regulations apply, I may have been remiss in not getting out all the regulations made using powers under sections 158 and 160 of the 1960 Act to see how far they are controlling the operation of these clauses. We need some guidance so that we can go to the Vote Office to obtain the necessary regulations and then look for the part of the legislation into which this will be translated and which the Minister has referred to as controlling our procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, it in no way denigrates from the argument used by my hon. Friend as to the advisability of requiring within the clause the specifying of the people to be consulted and the area to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
covered by regulations, because the regulation power, subject to negative procedure, is wholly in the hands of the Minister and his successors. If the Minister were to bring a statutory instrument under the negative resolution procedure, the House would be able either to accept it as it stood or to pray against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am aware that the right hon. Gentleman was once chairman of the Statutory Instrument Committee. He has a great deal of knowledge on this subject, but I ask him to forget that knowledge for the moment and return to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to forget that entirely and argue solely that what the Minister has said to us now in the debate on the amendment suggests that the way in which clause 6 can operate when the Bill becomes an Act could be subject to instruments that have already been made under the 1960 Act. I ask the Minister to confirm whether that is so. If it is so, will he say what effect they will have on the operation of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is fair. No doubt the Minister will now be able to answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my right hon. Friend on two matters. One is a query to the Minister. It is not intended as a personal criticism, but I am trying to do what I understand to be my task, namely, to make certain points and get queries answered. The Parliamentary Secretary tends to answer my questions, even though I do not like the answers, whereas the Minister did not answer a number of specific questions, particularly in the debate on the Question, That clause 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I must emphasise that there are one or two specific questions to which I should like an answer from the Minister before I can decide—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Gentleman realises that whether or not the Minister answered certain questions in the debate on clause 5, all he may ask the Minister to answer is on clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. English, I should be loth to go back to clause 5—or, for that matter, to clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>775</span>
There are two questions I wish to ask the Minister, and the one to which I should like a specific answer relates to the status of the disabled, if clause 6 is accepted, in comparison with the status of the disabled and the obligations of operators as they stand at present. My understanding is that under existing law the traffic commissioner may decide to refuse a licence application if he is not satisfied that adequate provision will be made for certain disabled persons or categories of disabled persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the only power that the traffic commissioner will have will be to make conditions. Will the Minister say, therefore, whether a traffic commissioner will be able in future to refuse a licence application if he is not satisfied with the provision to be made for the disabled in relation to that application? That is an important question to which I and all disabled persons and the organisations representing the disabled are entitled to an answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted with approval the documents and representations made by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. But I find the rather scaremongering representations that the association makes to members, in favour of eliminating or watering-down provisions for the disabled in public transport, entirely distasteful and something of which the AMA should be ashamed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further matter which relates to the disabled. It was raised by the AMA, and it is a relevant point. It is the fear that obligations to provide for the disabled are more likely to be imposed by traffic commissioners on public sector bus companies than they are on the private sector. Again, I hope that I and the disabled can look to the Minister for an answer tonight, saying that he will make clear by way of regulation, exhortation, ministerial statement, policy advice issued to traffic commissioners, or whatever is likely to be effective, that he will expect traffic commissioners to pursue the policy of giving priority to the disabled, whether the operator is in the public or the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those two important points will be clarified. Our progress towards a society in which the disabled are not disadvantaged by their physical disability is pathetic, and I believe that we should look at all legislation to see if we can do something to help them along that long
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
and—for them—hard road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it unique that in the whole of this Bill there is nothing which relates to the disabled and the handicapped? Are the Government so impressed with profit that they do not worry about the handicapped? What my hon. Friend said is so valid—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. On Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman is entitled to raise the absence of items in the Bill. But we are not now on Second Reading. We are on the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. I shall draw this intervention to a close, but I am sure that the point has not been lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will not, however, be replied to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause, which the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) has clearly not read, makes specific reference to the need to give particular regard to securing the safety and convenience of the public, including persons who are disabled. The hon. Gentleman should read the clause before he makes such interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause certainly makes reference to the disabled, but we must make sure that it does not in any way derogate from the present provision for the disabled and, if possible, that it takes it further. I think the two points that I put to the Minister about disablement are valid, and I hope we shall get satisfactory answers. This seems to be the only point in the Bill where attention is paid to the problems of the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust I shall not trespass out of order by referring in broad terms to clause 6, and certain aspects of it which were discussed on the previous amendment. Further to the decision of the Committee not to take on board the amendment, there is a further point of clarification. The Minister asserted that the existing regulations plus the undertaking which he gave in response to the amendment were better, wider, more thorough and more useful than the amendment which we had immediately previously been discussing. That leaves me in some confusion, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
it is my understanding that the Minister said that the traffic commissioners will be obliged—and that is the important point—by the regulations to notify and seek representations on any variation in the licence conditions. I thought that that was probably going a little far. What we wanted was an obligation to notify and to seek representations on major and significant variations, because I think that we should all support any valid, sensible and well-thought-out effort to cut down the bureaucratic flow of paper. To notify everybody of a 20-yard shift in the location of a bus stop and to invite their comments on it, seems to be carrying things to extremes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to say, bearing in mind clause 6 as drafted, the regulation to which he referred and the undertaking which he has given, whether there will still be an obligation on the traffic commissioners, in every case of a variation either proposed by a licensee or on the initiative of the traffic commissioners themselves, to notify and seek comments, as well as to consider any comments received in the case of each and every variation of a licence condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a feature of the present road service licensing system that the traffic commissioners are able to attach conditions to road service licences and to remove or vary those conditions once they are attached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1960 Act refers particularly to conditions on fares and stopping places and requires copies of timetables, and faretables to be carried on the vehicle. It also refers to the attachment of conditions generally, for securing the safety and convenience of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, this clause does not deal with fares. They are in the provisions of clause 7. But the rest remains in a modernised form. There is only one change of substance. Under the 1960 Act the commissioners were required to consider whether to vary conditions whenever the licence holder applied. Under this Bill they would be required to vary conditions as requested, except to the extent that they are satisfied that to do so would be against the interests of the public. That change is consistent with our philosophy of road service licensing. Although licensing control is required an operator is prevented from doing what he wants to do only where
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
there are overriding reasons of public interest against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the various points that have been made, undoubtedly the major point has been that the status of the disabled, with which both the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) dealt. I am sure that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South will not mind me saying that he rather trespassed backwards into clause 5 when he spoke about refusing the licence application on the grounds of a policy for the disabled. That would be possible but only if it was an overwhelming part in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as clause 6 relates to a policy for the disabled, it might be stipulated that stopping places should be arranged for the benefit of the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more general point is that the right hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that policy regarding the disabled is of fundamental importance. There is no difference between the two sides of the Committee on that. I should like to give thought to what he said about a more positive role in that area. We raised that matter in the debate on the 1978 Act. We must remember the obligations that we place on the operators. As far as possible I should like to meet what he and his hon. Friend say, namely that we should meet the needs of the disabled in a public transport policy. I am sure that that is right. Unless one is able to do that, the fundamental work opportunities that may be available for the disabled may be denied them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give more thought to what the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South have said. They have made a very serious point to which I should like to respond. I am not sure that I can respond to it in detail on clause 6, but they may be assured that the Government have it on board. I should like to talk further about this with my right hon. Friend the Minister who is in charge of policy for the disabled. I believe I am right in saying that next year is the year of the disabled. Certainly, without trespassing too far down this path, Mr. English, as I see you looking slightly impatient, I should like to see whether we cannot make a real contribution to that area. I hope, at any rate, that both the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
will accept that their points have been fully taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the rest of the clause is controversial, but the fundamental division between us is whether it is right to seek to put the conditions into the Bill or whether we should rely on regulation-making power. I honestly believe that the case for the regulation-making power, which we have sought to deploy on two previous groups of amendment, has been made out. I think that the arguments on that are by now well known. I must tell Labour Ministers that if we write more and more conditions into the Bill, or seek to write into the Bill matters which are at present dealt with by regulations, we shall have a massive Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand entirely the right hon. Gentleman's point about some of the defects of regulation-making, the negative resolution procedure and so on. On the other hand, the system has a flexibility which in terms of transport policy is often of very great benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister. The assurance that he gave has made it worth my while staying tonight. I wonder whether in the interim, between
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
his discussions with the Minister responsible for the disabled, he could see his way to giving a general indication to traffic commissioners that they should be seeking to make provision for the disabled with both public and private operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give careful consideration to that point and let the hon. Gentleman know during the course of the Committee stage. What I am anxious to do, and what I believe needs to be done, is that the Ministry of Transport should give attention to this important policy area which I do not think that any Government can claim to have got right. Next year will focus our attention upon the needs of the disabled. If we can make a contribution in that respect, I should personally wish to make it. I do not believe that there would be any difference between the two sides of the Committee on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
