	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 308, in page 35, line 26, leave out "may, with the consent of the Treasury" and insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<br><blockquote><p>"shall completely fund those obligations".</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"shall completely fund these obligations".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of this group of amendments is to put some precision and certainty into a clause that is all vagueness and uncertainty. The clause appears to be the parliamentary equivalent of the punter who backs every horse in a five-horse race, and some of them each way. The wording of the clause makes that apparent, even on the most cursory examination. It begins with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Minister, having determined that all or any of the securities of the successor company held by him or by nominees for him should be offered for sale."</p></blockquote>
The clause, therefore, begins with one ministerial option. It continues in subsection (3) by saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Minister gives an undertaking"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1796</span>
certain things shall follow. In subsection (4) the clause goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If no undertaking is given".</p></blockquote>
The general impression left by the clause on an objective reader is that either the Minister has not made up his mind on how he wants to deal with the many detailed and important questions that arise—even given that his aim is to fund part of the NFC's pensions—or, having decided upon it, he certainly does not want to tell the Committee or Parliament at this time how he intends to go about it. The Minister appears to be leaving himself a considerable number of options. But, since the choice of those options affects, first, the nature of this legislation, and, secondly, and equally important, the return which the public will get on its assets in the NFC, it is necessary at an early stage in discussing these amendments to have some guidance from the Minister on some clear and precise questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is to reject the amendments he must explain to the Committee whether it is his intention that the Committee, and subsequently the House, should give him powers to choose from at least three courses which appear to be in the clause, and which would certainly be narrowed and curtailed if the amendments were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first appears to be a choice of putting on the market, or requiring his nominees to do so, either all or a certain proportion of those shares which were produced in exchange for the loans and initial capital funding of the NFC at a fixed price and with a guarantee on how far the sale would be used to fund those pension liabilities which the NFC has arising from its employees who had road service prior to the creation of the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does that, the Committee has a direct interest in knowing, before we agree to this clause or seek to reject it, the extent to which these obligations will be funded on the Minister's decision. The price that those shares will fetch, no matter what the nominal value is, must depend to a considerable extent on how much confidence those who buy them can have that there will be a complete funding of this pension obligation. In other words, if prospective purchasers had any reason to suspect that they would obtain a part ownership in a successor company which would not have the road pensions fully funded, they would be likely either to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1797</span>
reduce the purchase or purchase at a much lower price and thereby devalue an important public asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear that we are opposed to the concept of selling off the NFC. However, given that the Government, with their majority, will push it through anyway, we see it as at least part of our duty—and we hope that some Government Back Benchers will also see it as part of their duty—to ensure that the public get a proper return on their holding. Without some of the amendments, on the present information that we have from the Government, there must be considerable uncertainty in the minds of people considering the purchase of shares in the NFC. Therefore, it is necessary here and now for the Minister to make a statement about his intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the hon. Gentleman's intention that the sale shall only be made when he is prepared to guarantee that there will be a full funding—that would accord with the general view expressed upon that matter on Second Reading—how will he bring that guarantee about, other than in the terms of our amendments? Presumably, he cannot guarantee that the initial sale will produce the full funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the case that, under the terms of subsection (3), as qualified by subsection (5), he will not be able to give an undertaking to pay more into the funding than he obtains from the sale of the shares? His own guarantee to make the payment to the trustee of the fund could not be a guarantee to pay more than is obtained from the sale. So, in any case, there will be a doubt in the minds of those who consider purchase, unless the Minister can say something this morning which will persuade us, and many people who have read this Bill and have considered the propositions in it, that there is a way of initially floating the shares which will fully fund the road service pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that with a clear appreciation that we are discussing only one of six main categories of pensions involved in British Rail and National Freight Corporation pension arrangements, but I want to keep the issue within the narrow context, believing that there will be ample opportunities on later clauses to deal with the complications which arise from other categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give a guarantee, however, in respect of this category? Or are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1798</span>
we right in supposing that any undertaking to pay into funds could not produce more money for the trustees of the funds than could the sale of share option in guaranteeing that some, or even all, of the proceeds of sale, if that were less than the cost of the road service pension funding, would be available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From that follows the next question, which seems to me to be one of the main criteria by which the amendments should be judged. If the Minister cannot give a guarantee at that stage, is it his intention to delay the flotation until he feels that there is the best chance of making the guarantee? If so, what happens under the provisions of the clause to the maintenance of the funds by the successor company in the meantime? Will the present guarantees under the 1978 Act continue to operate, or will the repeal provisions of the bill take effect so that part of the return on the successor company's holding of shares will have to be used to cope with current funding obligations? If the latter is the case, it will produce a scenario in which the sale of shares can be judged and the extent and cost of the obligations can be better estimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I am aware, the last actuarial evaluation of the cost of the obligations took place at the time of the 1978 Act. That must be considerably outdated by now. Therefore, in so far as the explanatory and financial memorandum appears to be based upon that valuation, the Committee has no accurate guide as to the kind of sale of public asset required for the purpose of funding the road service pensions of NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's current estimate of the level of sale now required to cover the road service pensions? I take it that the £25 million mentioned in the memorandum is based upon the 1978 valuation and that a much higher figure would now apply. If £100 million is the total in respect of the NFC, I assume that we admit that part of that will not be within the valuation carried out for the purpose of sale of the shares, as it relates more to initial capital funding and loans than to current working assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would therefore be most useful to have the up to date information. We may then discuss in a more intelligent way how far the amendments would go to meet the problems that I have raised, all of which fall under the broad heading of imprecision and multiple options for the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0977">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1799</span>
that we wish to see narrowed down in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the assets are to be sold in the way proposed in the Bill, at least two aims would then be achieved. First, the public's assets would be sold at the best price. Secondly, but no less importantly, those who have the duty of running the pension funds of the NFC, in so far as the funds cater for those carrying road service pension rights, will have sufficient money fully to meet the obligations that will fall upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief contribution at this stage to clarify and focus the purpose of the amendments in relation to the general purposes of the clause. My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) said in his opening remarks this morning that the whole clause was surrounded with vagueness and uncertainty as to precisely what will happen in the funding of the pensions obligations. I entirely agree with him that the purpose of the amendments is to try to put the stamp of certainty on some of the things that will be done in respect of the employees of the NFC when they become employees of the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debate clause stand part I intend to show a vivid contrast between the treatment of shareholders of the successor company and that of employees. The contrast is indeed striking. In the debate on the amendments I seek to know from the Minister the precise colour of this money when it comes to providing assurances on pensions for those who work for the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a convoluted clause. That does not make it an exception in the Bill by any means. It seeks to cover the Minister in any each-way bet he cares to make, or not to make—indeed in any combination of circumstances whatsoever. As I understand it, the clause says what will happen if the schemes are inadequately funded. The criterion is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Minister"</p></blockquote>
—that the schemes are inadequately funded. I do not know what is meant by making the matter dependent on whether it appears to the Minister that something is or is not so. Presumably actuarial calculations can be made with regard to pen-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1800</span>
sions. There is no need to rely on appearances; a reasonable degree of certainty is attainable. Many things in this world, especially in political life, are uncertain. Many things are beyond financial calculation. But on the face of it the subject of pensions is not one of them. A certain amount of mathematics can be brought to bear on that subject. A reasonably reliable range of options can be presented. However, I may be wrong. I await the Minister's wisdom, which we shall receive in due course. My point is a preliminary to the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having negotiated that first hurdle in the Grand National of the pensions obligations—the word "appears"—we come to a number of others. If it appears that the schemes are inadequately funded the Minister "may" chip in with some kind of undertaking. As I read it that means that it is optional. The Minister is proceeding with due caution over the pension schemes. He is not exactly throwing money away here—not that he should do that. But such a degree of caution strikes me as excessive in the circumstances. He should be in a generous frame of mind with regard to NFC employees. They are going through a period of uncertainty in any event. They are being pretty poorly treated. The amendments seek to clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister may chip in with some kind of undertaking. Presumably that will name a sum of money that is to be put into the schemes in an attempt to fund the obligations. But if the sale of the century flops and the NFC shares do not realise the figure given in the undertaking, that will release the Minister from any obligation. The Minister is to have it all ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is in striking contrast to the treatment given in previous clauses to future shareholders of the successor company. There was no mention then of "if it appears" to be the case. There was a straight statement: the initial capital obligations and the loan obligations were to be liquidated. There was no "if" or "but", no "perhaps" or "appears". It had the certainty of the rule of law. But now we come to deal with the NFC's employees there are all sorts of uncertainties. That is a striking contrast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us go on. There is no end to the convolutions of the clause. If the aggregate of the share moneys does not reach the undertaking threshold, so to speak, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1801</span>
understand that the Minister can still chip in. Is that so? Perhaps that point will be clarified. So if there is an undertaking, with a figure having been put on it, and the sale of the shares does reach that amount, he will be released from it. But if the aggregate of the share moneys does not reach the undertaking threshold the Minister can still chip in. Again, if the Minister has given no undertaking, as I understand the matter he can still chip in. I understand also that however the Minister chips in—with an undertaking or not—the amount cannot exceed what he has received for the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Put together, all that means is that the Minister is committing himself to nothing. In the plain light of day, all the clause says is that the Minister can give to the fund just what he decides to give—or not, as the case may be. As my right hon. Friend said, the matter is shrouded in uncertainty. He was absolutely right about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through our amendments we are suggesting what should be done in a clear-cut way with regard to the funding of the pension scheme. They state flatly that the scheme should be fully funded. There can be some argument about the types of scheme—that is, whether it would be more suitable for it to be funded or whether it should be the pay-as-you-go sort. But the fact is that the successor company will be stuck with a funded scheme. The amendments seek an obligation for that funded scheme to be fully funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the amendments are a fair set of propositions because they put treatment of the employees of the NFC and the successor company on all fours with that given the shareholders. As I read the clause, there will be no full funding unless the market price covers it. So when my right hon. Friend said that the clause was shrouded in uncertainty, if I interpret him correctly he meant that the employees will depend on the vagaries of the market place for the funding, or non-funding, of their pension schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring only to those employees of the National Freight Corporation who have road service pension rights. If my fears are realised the position would be rather worse, in that the rights of those with road service pensions would be left to the vagaries of the course that has been suggested, and those with rail
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1802</span>
service rights would be considered in an entirely different way under later provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. It is clear that the matter will become more complicated as we proceed. I fully take the point about the restrictive category of pensions that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something that is not stated in the clause and which perhaps cannot be clarified by the amendments, although it may be made clear when we debate clause stand part. If there remains a gap in the funding of these pensions, what happens to the pensioners? No one has asked that yet, but I am asking now and I shall bring it up again when we come to clause stand part. I fear the worst, and presumably, at present, so do they. There is nothing in the clause that says that if the schemes are not fully funded according to the funding principle, anyone will top them up with a pay-as-you-go scheme or anything such as that to stop them dropping without a net to the floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, this group of amendments has a common theme. First, they aim to clarify what exactly is happening as regards the funding of the pensions. Secondly, they seek to safeguard the employees by saying that there should be no uncertainty whatever and that the Minister should have the categorical obligation fully to fund the scheme so that the employees can be treated every bit as fairly as the successor shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would probably be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervened now. First, I apologise to the Committee for the fact that there may be complications in the drafting of this pensions legislation. This is not something peculiar to the Transport Bill. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Government Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen), came together for our first battles over this matter on the Social Security Bill introduced by Mrs. Barbara Castle, which again proved and established many of the points that the Opposition have raised about the obscurity and complexity of such legislation. It happens to be the name of the game that pensions legislation is, of necessity, complex, as it tries to meet the eventualities which the Opposition have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

pointed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or in this case, not meet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt wish to extend that argument later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 40 basically is to provide the power under which some or all of the proceeds of sale of the shares in the successor company may be paid over to its pension scheme so as to reduce or eliminate certain of its obligations to those schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the Minister, he said "scheme". It is one of a group of schemes within the NFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost corrected myself as I said it. I should have said "may be paid over to its pension schemes". The right hon. Gentleman is quite correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distinction I would ask the Minister to make is that it can pay over from the sale of shares only in respect of road service schemes. There are, of course, other schemes in the NFC which cannot receive money from this source.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point to which I was coming. The right hon. Gentleman must understand that this distinction has not been made by the present Government. It was made in the Transport Act 1978. On part III of the Bill we will come to railway schemes. Here we are dealing with road-based schemes and obligations. That is basically what clause 40 and the following clauses are concerned with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is likely that the sale of shares in the successor company will take the from of a public offer for sale of shares at a fixed price specified in the prospectus. In that event, it would be necessary for the prospectus also to specify what sums were proposed to be paid over to the pension schemes, as the extent to which the road-based obligations would or would not be funded would obviously be relevant to the value of the shares to be sold. In other words, everyone would want to know where they were in an individual transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the clause empowers the Minister, when offering shares for sale, to undertake to pay to the pension schemes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1804</span>
sums to be specified in the undertaking, though any such undertaking is to be conditional on the proceeds of the sale being not less than the total of the sums thus specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, the road-based obligations for the NFC pension scheme were set in 1978 at £25 million. He asked what value we can now put on that, but it is difficult for me to give an estimate at this point. My hon. Friend quoted a figure of between £30 million and £40 million as a rough estimate of the amount of the value of the deficiencies and we are talking about that sort of area. Clearly, inflation has meant that the deficiencies are greater than they were in 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1978 reconstruction gave effect to a decision of the Government of the day in the Transport Act 1978 that the NFC should receive assistance in respect of its rail-based obligations. The 1978 Act provided for the funding of the rail-based obligations to the NFC schemes and funding under the Railways Act 1974 was extended to relieve the rail-based obligations relating to the BRB schemes. Part III of the Bill continues with that assistance. On the other hand, it did not seek to change the situation in that respect for the road-based obligations. I advise the right hon. Gentleman that this was a point which the NFC put at the time of the 1978 Act—it is not a new point—and the previous Government considered the position. It was a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), who was on the 1978 Committee, will recollect was raised directly with the last Secretary of State. So, too, will the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) who attended throughout the proceedings of the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the NFC's road-based pension liabilities at present stand to be discharged by the corporation basically out of revenue. The payments are currently £2.5 million a year compared with a turnover of £480 million. That position will remain until the shares have been sold. The decision that we have already reached on the NFC is a policy decision which will continue until the sale of the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Administration did not support the road-based obligations. Obviously, I have looked at this question and do not see any reason to question
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1805</span>
their decision. Road haulage is a profitable business, and so long as the corporation remains a nationalised industry with the implied Government commitment that that entails there is no reason why it should not meet its obligations by means of deficiency payments. We feel that the position would be rather different when the corporation comes to be moved out of the public sector. Investors would be concerned if the balance sheet reflects pension fund deficiency. I entirely respond to what was said by the hon. Member for Ipswich about generosity. We shall seek to be as generous as we conceivably can be in the transfer of employment. Therefore, clauses 40 and 41 were included in the Bill basically to facilitate the sale of shares. Clearly, the deficiencies would be a disincentive to investors whom I believe would prefer to pay a high price for the NFC without deficiencies than a lower price for the NFC with deficiencies. The substance of what we propose is that the deficiencies should be funded by the private investors rather than by the Government. The Government will collect the contributions and pay them over to the pension funds rather than act as a contributor in their own right. Given that there are clear differences in the Committee in our general strategy I should not have thought that the Opposition would wish to oppose that part of the policy or challenge in principle the fact that private investors' money should be paid into the pension shemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision on the amount of funding to be provided on clause 40 stands to be made at the time of the sale. Conditions may be different from what they now are, and I believe that it is desirable to have a power to apply part of the proceeds of the sale to funding the road-based deficiencies. We need to preserve flexibility, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, and, clearly, that is what we have done. We will decide how to use the power when the sale is an immediate prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not remove the underlying obligation which the corporation has and which, in due course, the successor company will also have, to its pension schemes. In other words, the NFC as at present constituted, and the successor company, will have clear obligations to their pension schemes. It is the Government's intention that funding under clause 40 should be sufficient to prevent pension
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1806</span>
funds deficiencies from becoming an obstacle sale. Given that any substantial deficiencies would prove to be an obstacle—at least in present circumstances—I hope that this would be sufficient assurance for pension schemes members and pensioners that we wish to behave as generously as possible in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal now in a little detail with the individual amendments and no doubt hon. Members will wish to come back both on the detail and the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 308 and 312 concern the consent of the Treasury. The amendments would basically delete the requirement for the Minister to obtain the consent of the Treasury before giving an undertaking to make payments towards the funding of the road-based deficiencies. They would also have the effect of making the giving of such an undertaking mandatory rather than permissive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention is to require treasury approval in financial legislation of this kind, and I see no reason to break with that convention in this instance. The Treasury would expect to be consulted anyway, whether or not that was written into legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change from "may" to "shall" would have no practical effect since the Minister would retain discretion on the amount of the payment, as can be seen from the last part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 would delete subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>). This requires that the Minister's undertaking to make a payment to the NFC pension schemes shall be conditional upon the amount received from the sale of the shares being greater than the amount of the undertaking. In other words, the Minister may not promise to pay to the funds more than he expects to receive from the sale of the shares. The amendment would remove that restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the clause as drafted prevents a sale from taking place if the amount required for the pension funds is greater than the likely proceeds of the sale. That is a sensible provision. It is clearly nonsense for the Minister to pay more into pension funds than he expects to realise from the sale of the shares. It is therefore right to recognise that in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 40 enables the Minister to give an undertaking in advance of the offer for sale of shares in the successor company to the NFC to make a payment into the NFC pension funds out of the proceeds of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1807</span>
sale. That is the basic point. The purpose of amendments Nos. 309 and 313 is to ensure that any such payment is sufficient completely—"completely" is the crucial word—to fund the NFC's obligations to its pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that this may be a crucial point with the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. The NFC's road-based pension liabilities stand at present to be discharged by the corporation out of revenue. The payments are £2½ million a year, out of a turnover of about £480 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position will obviously be different when the corporation is moved out of the public sector. We want to change the position so that investors will not be concerned at the pension fund deficiencies in the balance sheet. However, we do not believe that it would be desirable to write into the Bill a requirement that funding should be "complete". What constitutes complete funding would be a matter of actuarial judgment, and the judgment of actuaries can differ widely. Attempts to write a requirement of this kind into the statute could lead not only to litigation but to extended and unproductive litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am happy to give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that the Government under this clause will be sufficient to enable the actuary to certify that the NFC's pension funds are in a satisfactory state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one further point on amendment No.311. Subsection (3) is not an integral part of the machinery of clauses 40 and 41. It is one of the less important provisions in the Bill, and was included by way of tidiness, since it secures that the power to apply the proceeds of sale to the funding of the road-based obligations is available, even if the proceeds of sale fall short of the sum originally specified. It is most unlikely that we would ever wish to make use of the power. If it is the wish of the Committee, the Government are prepared to accept the amendment and delete subsection (3). A very minor consequential drafting amendment would then be necessary, and if a manuscript amendment were permitted we could move a little later in the clause, on page 36 subsection (5) in line 10, to leave out "(3) or". We are, therefore, prepared to meet the point made by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the length of my inter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1808</span>
vention, but I felt it was for the benefit of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some trepidation to talk about pensions, because I have never even understood the pensions schemes of which I have been a member, still less been able to understand the NFC's pension schemes. Consequently, I will not get bogged down in detail because I do not have the command of the detail or technicalities so to get bogged down. I shall keep my comments simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first priority in dealing with the NFC pensions, or the railway pensions in part III, should be security for the pensioners and staff of those transport industries. That is the primary consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workers in the NFC are already disturbed at the prospect of their concern being sold off to the private sector. Consequently, it is necessary not only to provide actual financial security but to give some sense of security—if there is any security—as regards their pension rights and the state of the pensions funds to which they have contributed. That is particularly relevant to the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read the pensions clauses in parts II and III, I laboured under the misapprehension that the Government were concerned to secure the rights of existing pensioners and staff of these transport undertakings. But that is not so. The more carefully I read the provisions, and the more carefully I listen to the Minister and re-read what was said on Second Reading, the clearer it becomes that that is not the primary objective of clauses 40 and 41. The primary objective is to take an element of uncertainty out of the scheme for selling off the National Freight Corporation. Clauses 40 and 41 are designed primarily to take away the element of uncertainty of the underfunding of the road-based NFC schemes so that the company will be more attractive to private investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is another way of putting the hon. Gentleman's own point. Would that not provide, by the very assurance that it gives, the kind of assurance that he seeks for the pensioners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. I regard it as no assurance at all. It may be of some assurance to certain speculators

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1809</span>
in the City who may decide to buy shares in the company when they are offered, because they will have a rough idea of the extent to which they may in the future have to make up the actuarial shortfall on the scheme. They will therefore have an element of security. But that does not mean that the pensioners and staff involved will necessarily be secure in the provisions that the Minister and those private shareholders may eventually make between them, should the company get into trouble. That is something that the Minister seems to ignore. Indeed, one of the reasons why the drafting is so convoluted is that the main priority is not to provide a secure pension scheme for anyone, but to provide something that the Minister can tell people in the City that they can rely on in deciding whether to buy shares in the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments should commend themselves to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary on the basis of the objectives of the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. The Parliamentary Secretary said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What was referred to was what would happen to the ordinary pension fund of the National Freight Corporation when it was denationalised. At the moment there are actuarial deficiencies in that fund and it would be quite wrong to sell the company when that fund is in that position."</p></blockquote>
I was listening carefully to what was said about pensions, having been adjured to do so, and I understood at that time that the intention was to deal with the whole of the deficiency and not just a part of it. The Parliamentary Secretary went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So the first call on the proceeds of sale of the equity will be to put the pension fund in order."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1239.]</p></blockquote>
I interpret that as meaning entirely in order, not partly in order with one shoulder strap unfastened, as it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our amendments is precisely that—to put the funds entirely in order and to ensure that there is no actuarial deficiency when they are transferred from the National Freight Corporation to the company. The majority vote on Second Reading may have been the result of that aspect of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, so that we should be here under false pretences if he did not live up to what he said at that time. There is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1810</span>
ample ground for saying that the burden of our amendments—that the shortfalls should be fully funded—represents exactly what the House thought on Second Reading would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should therefore expect the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to fulfil—indeed to fill full—the entire shortfall on the funding. Our amendments are intended to ensure that the first call on the sale of the assets will be to fund entirely the actuarial deficiencies on the road-based schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider one detail. The Minister has referred to that part of the clause that would prevent him from contributing more than the proceeds of the sale towards funding the pension obligations. I understand that the actuarial shortfall that has been mentioned was roughly £25 million two years ago—if that is the wrong figure I should be happy to be corrected. Whereas even the notional assets of the NFC are £100 million, £60 million of which represents land last valued in 1968. I have no great faith in the competence of the Government, or indeed in that of their advisors in the City. But if they cannot sell an asset that is undervalued at £100 million so as to raise more than £25 million they ought to resign now, or at least withdraw from the loony proposals to sell off the NFC in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is entirely unnecessary. It should not be needed as a protection for anyone. Ordinary straightforward business competence ought to render that part of the clause unnecessary. We should always try not to put redundant provisions into the laws that we consider. The parts that are actually necessary are bad enough. We certainly do not want unnecessary inclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one further point. No doubt it will be treated as underhand. However, there is some irony in the Minister's trying to ensure that steps can be taken with regard to the pension rights of transport workers only with the consent of the treasury. I know that you would be unwilling to accept manuscript amendments, Mr. English. Otherwise I should like to put forward one saying that either Treasury approval would be forthcoming or—as a quid pro quo for advising that freight transport industry pensioners' rights would not be honoured—the senior civil servants at the Treasury would agree to give up their non-contributory index-linked pensions as an earnest of their com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

mitment to cutting public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be no surprise to the hon. Gentleman that I should be most reluctant to accept such an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, Mr. English. Perhaps we could pursue further the idea of such an amendment on Report. We have many possibilities in mind for Report stage. To table such an amendment would seem to be a worthwhile effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I shall deal with a semi-technical point. Personally I view amendment No. 311 as a probing amendment. We wished to find out exactly what subsection (3) intended. Although I am not entirely clear what it provides, on my innocent and ignorant reading of it that subsection seems to go some way towards looking after the rights of pensioners in the event of the Minister giving an undertaking and being unable to fulfil it. It therefore seems wise, proper and wholly just not to delete subsection (3). It is the only part of the clause that would give some guarantee in the event of the Ministry organising a cock-up in certain circumstances. Our probing amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it correct that the hon. Gentleman, have proposed the amendment, now does not want the Goverment to accept it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly. As the Minister well knows, the object of probing amendments is to elicit information and to find out whether the drafting means something that is not on the face of the Bill, or to give those who table them the opportunity to make political or technical points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in Furness (Mr Booth) agrees with my view. The amendment is probing, as have many others been which have met with some success in that they have led to further reflection by Ministers, and so on. Certainly, it seems to me that unless the Minister comes up with an explanation of the meaning of subsection (3) and its convoluted wording, it may be regarded as a minor element of protection for the pensioners and staff concerned if there were to be a total shambles in the disposal of the National Freight Corporation's assets on the market. Certainly, we would wish, with the leave of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1812</span>
the Committee, to withdraw amendment No. 311. I believe that, if the Minister were to use his majority on the Committee to allow the amendment to go through, it would sour my view of him and of the Committee's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to point out the amendment's intention. It is almost trite to say that they are probing. However, it is also true to say that often when we table amendments we simply do not fully understand the implications of a clause, or even sometimes the way in which it has been amended. Indeed, having heard explanations I may still have considerable doubts. I do not believe that I am unique in that; many experience the same problem, even those who have studied a subject for a long time. Sometimes, having listened to experts, I do not know whether I have been any clearer after their explanations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, we must struggle on as best we can to try to understand what is happening. Therefore, amendment No. 311 must be seen in the context of its being a probing amendment. If the Minister were to say, "In the circumstances, I am prepared to take out the subsection in question", one may conclude "Oh, he is bound to be party to something that will remove any obligation for the Minister to pay money into a fund."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to hear what the Minister says about the matter. If he feels that the subsection is sufficiently important to be taken out, he can do that himself, and be well aware of his responsibility in doing so. It will have become the responsibility of the Government rather than of the Opposition, who may table a probing amendment with many more implications that was first realised. In such circumstances, it is proper for the Opposition to say, "Let us hear what the Minister has to say. That will go on record and we can consider the matter again on Report should we wish to restore a subsection which has been removed by one of our probing amendments." I do not believe that there is anything wrong in that approach in such a highly technical matter as the pension proposals that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend pointed out on the last series of amendments, we are dealing with a very narrow principle concerning the National Freight Corporation. The broader aspects of pension problems are identified much more closely in part
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0984">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1813</span>
III of the Bill. As the Minister has stated, in this instance it is clear that we are dealing with the NFC's historic road-based pensions, which I gather go back to when the British Transport Commission was in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the same principle is involved as that in part III, namely, the security of those who are in pension funds at present. Indeed, that same argument has gone on in the Public Accounts Committee of the House and in the Select Committee reports concerning Government action regarding whether one is more secure with a funded pension obligation and a capitalisation programme or with a pay-as-you-go system. It seems that we are dealing with the present NFC principle of a pay-as-you-go system in regard to the road-based pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that at present the NFC pays something around £2.25 million or £2.5 million out of its turnover of £480 million as the pay-as-you-go pensions payment referred to in the clause. My first inclination is to say that that seems a small amount compared to the turnover and the relevant point is the amount to be paid out of profits, not out of turnover. That is relevant to the company's ability to fund its pension requirements and to those who want to buy shares in the company, so, while, the point about turnover may show an order of magnitude it is not entirely relevant to the matter of pensions. We are dealing with whether people under the pension schemes presently funded by a sort of pay-as-you-go system can be as assured by the Government's measures in the amendments for a new company with its pension obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is reasonably clear in the sense that the payments are to come out of profits or turnover, however one may see it, but it has the assurance that a nationalised industry carries with it a certain amount of security. Up to the present, the policy pursued was that implemented by the previous Labour Administration to capitalise certain pension funds. That would deal solely with rail-based pension obligations, as I understand matters, not those that are road-based. As the Minister fairly pointed out, we have not picked up that tab, but there was an assurance to the workers, as members of a nationalised industry, that that obligation would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1814</span>
continued for them in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments are intended to deal with that matter of insecurity. The Bill declares that the NFC is to go private, and our concern is for the people covered by the existing pension funds. Leaving aside amendment No. 311 for the present, the other amendments make clear that those covered by the pensions shall not be worse off and that there shall be complete pensions shall not be worse off and that there shall be complete pension funding so that the present obligations continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was made clear on Second Reading, a great deal of the pension funding for road-based pensions will be dependent on the sale of the assets. It is the Minister's intention to sell the assets of the NFC, and the first claim on moneys raised in that way will be by the pension obligations. Those obligations were originally estimated at £25 million, I believe, but the Minister has now indicated that that figure may be up to £35 million or £45 million at the appointed day of the sale, when the statement must be made by the Minister, which could be in 1981. There is no indication that the sale will take place this year and, therefore, another 12 months of rapidly increasing inflation will certainly bring these pension fund obligations up to about £50 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider that aspect against the fact that the assets are at present considered to be £100 million. That is an assessed value, because until the flotation of the shares, we shall not know the market interpretation of the real value of those shares, but clearly it will be less than £100 million. It is a matter of judgment whether that will be more than the actual pension obligations and, if so, by how much more, but the clause makes clear that if it is less we shall have the problem of how the difference is to be funded, if it is to be funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the estimated return on the flotation of the shares is less than the valuation by the actuarial body, will the sale be prevented, or will it still go ahead and will the Government fund the difference? In those circumstances, the public assets would not be sufficient to meet the obligations and the Minister would then have to fund the difference between what he raises from the shares and what he has to meet under the pension obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it has been suggested that perhaps the total assets will not be sold off in one flotation. The Minister may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1815</span>
consider that he will get a better price by selling 50 per cent. now and 50 per cent. later. If that is so, any outstanding pension obligations between the two separate sales will certainly affect the price of the second flotation of shares. The obligation will have become more apparent by 1982–83 because of inflation and other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister probably feels that he has gone as far as he can. He has assured us that instead of accepting our amendment to the effect that the Government will completely fund the obligation, he is prepared to assure the trustees and the recipients of pensions that the actuarial body will give a certificate of "satisfactory state". I do not know what that means to the accountant or the actuary. Perhaps the Minister can define it. What is the difference between a satisfactory state and a complete funding? We know what complete funding means, even though we may not be able to indentify the total amount of money. We know that it is a principle that must be faced and an obligation that must be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to take any more time. Time will be precious enough in talking about pensions. Perhaps the Minister could give some replies to those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is indebted to the Minister for his statement, because he has made clear certain aspects of the clause. He has shown that, under the provisions of clause 40 as drafted, it would be impossible for him and the Government to guarantee fully to fund the road service pension obligations of the NFC, unless the sale of the public assets, as I call them—that is shares in the successor company—produced sufficient to cover that funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has told us frankly and openly that nothing is hidden in the clause which would enable to him to step in and make other public money available to top-up the difference between what the shares realised on flotation and the total cost of funding the road service pensions of the NFC. Clarity is welcome in this area. The Minister has said, and I do not dissent, that other legislation dealing with pensions is not always an example of pristine clarity. After this statement about the intention and the limitation of the clause, we are faced with a number of serious questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is taking power to control the proportion of public assets put on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1816</span>
market at the time of flotation. He can decide whether it will be 40, 50 or 100 per cent. If his aim is to give the best chance of covering the road service pension obligations by the sale, there must be for him an incentive or a temptation to put the maximum amount on the market to ensure that prospective purchasers can have confidence that the full funding is met from the sale of the shares. My hon. Friends and I regard that as a double-edged weapon. We would rather the Minister retained in public ownership a substantial proportion of the shares. We find no attraction in that explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 311 is a probing amendment. Its intention is to show that subsection (5) so qualified subsection (3) that subsection (3) could not amount to any more than an intention to pay all the money that came from the sale of the shares to the trustees of the fund in certain circumstances, those being where the sale of the shares realised only sufficient, or less than sufficient, to meet the funding obligation. In the circumstances, I agree that we would be better to seek to withdraw the amendment and leave the obligation on the Minister and his supporters in the Committee, if they wish to take it up, they now having acknowledged that it is of little value to their own purposes. It is certainly of little value to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist the Committee procedurally? The only amendment that is before us is not the one that the Minister said he was prepared to accept. It is, of course, possible, with the consent of the Committee, for the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 308. Amendment No. 311 has not yet been moved. It is equally possible that anyone could move it forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that, Mr. English. I was running ahead. Amendment No. 311 has not been moved, as you say. My hon. Friends and I do not propose to move it. We leave the obligation with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to what I believe is the biggest dilemma in the clause, namely the inherent contradiction in the Government's position. They want two things that are mutually incompatible. They want to ensure that, when the shares of the NFC are floated, they will be so attractive that people will rush to buy them and ensure, among other things, that the sale
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1817</span>
price of those shares is such as to meet fully the funding. They have quite openly declared that to be their position. They have also acknowledged that whether or not the shares will be so attractive depends to a considerable extent on whether the shareholders will believe that they are buying a company on which road service pensions are fully funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand—this is the incompatible part, and where the contradiction comes in their position—the Government want to refuse to give an undertaking in the clause that the road service pensions will be fully funded. They have given their reasons for that, although not quite as clearly or fully. I do not think that I am paraphrasing unfairly the explanation of the reasons when I say that what the Government want under the clause is to be sure that, in the circumstances of a complete drop in the sale, they will not be liable for topping-up with public money in order to ensure full funding. That is the inherent contradiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's judgment is that the public interest is best served by ensuring that there is full funding, if the Government believe that with full funding the public asset will sell at the greatest value, they should back that judgment and give a commitment to full funding. If they believe that they are taking an enormous gamble or risk that they may not be able to realise enough, especially on the first sale of shares, to meet the funding if they float the NFC, let them say so openly, and we will know the extent to which this legislation is gambling with an important public asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These shares do, after all, represent a public asset. They are not only the concern of the shareholders. They are at this stage the concern of the public and in this clause they are the concern of those who have the responsibility for running a section of the NFC's pension funds and for the pensioners. Their pensions may well depend on the future performance of the company and on this very uncertain position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in view of this contradiction, the Minister must make his position clear. Is it his judgment that the government need to have this safeguard against a failure to sell? If not, why does he refuse to write into the clause a guarantee of full
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1818</span>
funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it will be most convenient for the Committee if I deal with the amendments, and the points made, in turn. I refer first to amendment No. 308, regarding the consent of the Treasury. The need to obtain Treasury consent is a normal convention in financial legislation. For instance, the Transport Act 1978 required Treasury approval to be obtained under capital grants, travel concession grants, and the funding of the NFC's rail-based deficiencies. There has, therefore, been very little, if any, argument on amendments Nos. 308 and 312.

As regards amendment No. 311, I previously sought to help the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), believing that he wanted to remove subsection (3) from the Bill, and I understand his motives for tabling the amendment. There is a balanced argument here. However, if amendment No. 311 is not moved, as I understood the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend to be saying, but they feel it would be in their interests, I will certainly give an undertaking to remove subsection (3) from the Bill at a later stage. If it is convenient to the Committee, I am certainly happy to give that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments in this group are crucial to the clause and to the argument put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. I understand the strength of feeling on these points. The Opposition are rightly and accurately taking up the case of those workers in the NFC whose employment will be changed. It is right for us to give as many assurances as we can in that respect. I believe that the balance we have achieved in the Bill does just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 concerns subsection (2), which requires that the Minister's undertaking to make a payment to the NFC pension scheme shall be conditional on the amount received from the sale of the shares being greater than the amount of the undertaking. In other words, the Minister may not promise to pay to the funds more than he expects to receive from the sale of the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably one of the points which lay behind the argument of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), was that the deficiencies should be funded in any event. It was suggested that if there are deficiencies in the NFC pen-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1819</span>
sion funds the Government should fund them, irrespective of the sale of shares. That is a matter of judgment and of clear disagreement between the two sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous Governments have only agreed to assist nationalised industry with pension fund deficiencies if that industry was unable to do so from its own resources. Many pension funds in the public and private sectors have deficiencies, and the usual practice is for them to be dealt with by annual payments spread over many years. The Labour Government took the view that, following its financial reconstruction, the NFC would be able to support the road-based deficiencies in its pension funds at a cost of £2.5 million a year. I do not disagree with that. Therefore, I believe that, in respect of amendment No. 310, the provision in the Bill is sensible. It would be nonsense for the Minister to pay more into the pension funds than he expects to realise from the sale of shares, and I advise the Committee against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last amendment, about which I believe that the right hon. Gentleman feels most strongly, there is the requirement completely to fund the obligations. I do not know whether there is much more that I can add to what I have already said about that. Pensioners and investors have a common interest. The money paid into the pension schemes reduces the liabilities and increases the value of the successor company. Equally, it provides security for pensioners' rights, as it would be invested in assets that would be held in trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the arrangements that we want the Committee to approve, we are asking for first call—this concerns what the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), said—on the proceeds from the sale of shares to go into the pension funds. That is our basic approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), asked whether, if the proceeds from the shares were not sufficient, that would prevent the sale. I agree that that would be the effect, although we do not believe that there is any reason why it should happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be right to interpret what the Minister has just said as meaning that, on initial flotation, it will be a condition of the offer for sale in that the Minister, through his nominees, will be saying, in effect, "we are offering to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1820</span>
sell the shares subject to their realising such-and-such a price, or subject to sufficient of them being taken up to realise whatever the Government estimate to be the cost of funding the road service pension scheme"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we do not wish that to happen, but it would be the purpose of what we are seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of completely funding the obligations is simply a matter for the Committee's judgment. I entirely understand what Opposition Members are saying. They would like to see written into the statute that funding should be complete. As I have said, what constitutes complete funding is a matter of actuarial judgment, which can differ widely and fundamentally, as we shall find out when we come to debate the later part of the Bill dealing with all the pension arrangements. Anyone who has gone through pensions legislation will know that to be a fact of life and will understand that judgments can vary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the case, attempts to write such a requirement into this sort of statute could lead to litigation. As I have done previously, I give an undertaking that the Government intend the amount of funding offered in this subsection to be sufficient to enable the actuary to certify that the NFC's pensions funds are in a satisfactory state. By that I mean that there are no deficiencies and that the assets and liabilities match. I understand that even that assurance may not be sufficient for the Opposition, but I believe that there are strong arguments against our going any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We thank the Minister for his explanations, which are leading to greater understanding of the matter. However, I would like to press him about "satisfactory". I am sure that he and I feel the same way about certain parts of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what the Minister said about a "satisfactory state", it seems quite a commitment to say that one is prepared to have a pension fund where the obligations are fully met and satisfied. Where is the difference between us? I assume that the estimates of what those obligations may be could be the difficulty, or the problem of the timing of the payments of such obligations, which can increase quite rapidly when one looks at the pension funds

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1821</span>
over a period of time. But, from what was said by the Minister about the actuaries being satisfied that all obligations are being met, I do not understand why it is so different to make sure that there is complete funding to face these obligations. That is what we are asking. What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is driving a hole through his own argument. The question I return to him is what would complete funding mean in a statutory sense? We are saying that when assessed at a particular time the assets and liabilities shall match and there shall be no deficiencies in the NFC's pension funds. That is the undertaking we are giving. Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen seems to be going a step further but without defining that step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I begin to understand that it is a matter of money, like everything else. The Minister is saying that he will be satisfied today but that he may not be satisfied tomorrow. The authority may say that, on the present basis of the scheme and the best judgment of what may happen, that is satisfactory at present. But the concern felt by those of us who have tabled amendments is to make sure that the obligation is one that continues if the fund is found to be in deficit for one reason or another, depending on events and the complex variables found in pension matters in two or three years' time after the Minister has reported. Therefore, the difference between us seems to be that we want to ensure that that obligation is maintained</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But that is a system that has been rejected in terms of pensions legislation, not just by itself but by successive Governments going back to the Railways Act 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee Divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>The amendment seeks to clarify the Minister's position determining the fund obligations, and to press upon him the case for having the sum required jointly determined by the Minister and the trustee of the fund or funds which cover British Road Service pensioners within the NFC. I believe that the trustee will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0989">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1823</span>
take the view that he has a responsibility to the pensioners and to the fund to declare whether he is satisfied with the Minister's evaluation of the fund's liabilities. It would be in the best interest of the Government and of the public that, at the time of floating the shares of the successor company, there should be no dissent from the valuation put by the Minister upon the historic road services obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister said that the shares were worth £30 million, and that the sale of £30 million worth of shares would completely fund the pension obligations, and the trustee said that £32 million or £35 million would be required, that would largely negate the aim declared by the Minister of ensuring that the shares were attractive to prospective purchasers. From that point of view alone, I think that there is a strong case for an agreement on fund obligations between the Minister and the trustee.</p>
	<p>The trustee, will also wish to be confident that he can carry out duties laid upon him in administering the fund after the sale of shares. At the moment it is difficult to estimate how much funding is required to cover continuing pension obligations. Given inflation and the return on the various holdings of pension funds, it is not an easy calculation to make. A big difference between the Minister's estimate of the cost of pension obligations and that of the trustee of the fund would be regarded with suspicion.</p>
	<p>That is the basis of the amendment. It is of importance in the context of the Bill as drafted, and it might have had even greater importance had the amendment been carried. But in the context of the Bill as it now stands, its direct effect is on the circumstances in which the flotation and sale are made. And whilst I would be the last person to wish to bring about circumstances which made it possible to sell off a public asset which I prefer to remain in public hands, I feel that there is a duty on the part of the Committee to the public, because their asset is being sold off, to the pensioners because their pensions are involved, and to the trustees, who have what is in all circumstances a difficult liability to discharge, but in the circumstances of moving to a completely funded arrangement at this stage, an extremely difficult one. Given those considerations, I hope that the Minister will give a favourable response to the amendment because we think it raises a serious and valid issue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1824</span>
which should be met in the context of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject matter of the amendment has been largely covered in the wide-ranging debate to which I listened with great interest on the previous group of amendments. My right hon. Friend, when replying, answered both arms of the points made on this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment questions what is meant by "full funding". An exchange took place only a short time ago between the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and my right hon. Friend about what we were aiming at, and my right hon. Gentleman gave a clear indication on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our intention that out of the proceeds of sale of shares in the company, the pension fund will be put in good order and the liability for the future removed from the company's books. There is no question of the Government entering into a continuing obligation to the fund. It is important to emphasise again that the Government do not at present give any guarantees to these road-based pension funds. They are in deficit, and are being topped up by regular annual payments of about £2½ million. Previous Governments have not guaranteed them and the Government do not intend to do so for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in order to facilitate the sale of the shares and put the company's book in order, we have undertaken to transfer the receipts from private investors that will be taken from the sale of the shares into the pension funds of the company in order to put the funds in good order. Any references to full funding in the amendment are uncertain in definition and seem to carry, for the Opposition, a continuing obligation or guarantee on the part of the Government towards the fund which the Government see no reason to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that there is little difference between us as regards the moment of sale and the moment of paying into the pension funds, because we are hoping to deal with the present actuarial deficiencies, the next question that arises is, should the amount of the payment, whatever purpose we are trying to achieve, be determined jointly by the Minister and the trustee of the fund? Presumably for this purpose the trustee is NFC Trustees Lim-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1825</span>
ited, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the corporation, established for the sole purpose of acting as trustee to the corporation's pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend dealt with that point in a different context when he dealt with the last group of amendments. Actuarial judgments are not as exact a science as non-actuaries would prefer. There is perhaps a vision of an actuary as a brilliant mathematician who, by collecting his data accurately and feeding it into his computer programme, can come up with an answer which is exact to the nearest pound. But the more one goes into actuarial judgments, the more one finds that there is a great deal of art involved. A wide range of opinions is possible between different actuaries about the validity of the various assumptions to be made for the future when arriving at actuarial opinion and advice, and, in the end, if one is seeking actuarial guidance, someone has to judge what is accurate and come to a decision. The amendment would leave no means of resolving the position that might arise if the actuarial advice received by the Minister and the trustee continued to disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could foresee wasteful and unnecessary litigation arising from a failure to understand what was meant by "fully funded" and complete stalemate and deadlock could arise if it proved impossible for the Minister and the trustee jointly to determine what the full liabilities should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way of dealing with it is as the Government intend. I am prepared to give the Committee an undertaking that we will consult fully and closely with NFC Trustees Ltd, as we have on all these pension matters. There will be consultation with it about what payment ought to be made, and, in so far as it is possible to reach agreement—and it should not be unduly difficult—I hope that that will be done. I do not think that it would be right to make it a statutory obligation under the Bill because it might give rise to conflict. In the end, one person has to carry the responsibility for making the final decision. Clearly that person should be the Minister, and that is how the Bill if unamended, would leave it. I do not see how things could be made easier by accepting the amendment. It could give rise to difficulty and I advise the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1826</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic argument arose on the previous amendment. But, bearing in mind what the Minister said about the differences between a satisfactory situation and complete funding, the question arises, what will happen in 1982, 1983 or 1984? The answer may again be shown to be the differences in the way various pension funds are funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is often made in this House that there is inflation proofing in pensions, but that in the public sector of industry pension provision tends to be better in many instances than in some private sector companies. Reference is often made to the pensions of Members of Parliament. The issue of index linking in pension provisions has been debated by the Public Accounts Committee. So a decision about pensions would clearly include consideration of index linking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other pensions covered in later parts of the Bill take account of index linking. That is certainly true of British Rail. In the private sector, however, the predominant pension provision is one that does not have a guarantee of index linking for inflation. So does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the difference between us is on whether the principle of index linking in some form should be continued from the public sector of this industry into the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is the difference. I do not think that it matters whether we are concerned with the public or the private sector. We have here a funded index-linked set of pension schemes. It is very difficult to fund index-linked pension schemes. At present anyone running an index-linked pension scheme probably finds that there is a need to top it up from time to time to make good deficiencies. That will continue so long as the rate of inflation continues to outstrip the likely rate of return that can be earned on any kind of investment. That has been the situation in this country for five or six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment we have a funded index-linked pension scheme that the NFC has entered into with its employees. It is not a scheme that the Government stand behind. It is not one that the Government stood behind in 1978. As we are about to sell the company to the private sector we are offering that the first call on the pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1827</span>
ceeds of sale should be to deal with the obligations up to the date of sale and to put the pension fund into decent order, to rid it of the present deficiencies, which are a serious liability to the company. Thereafter the position of the company and its pensioners will be no different from that which prevails at present. We cannot give a continuing guarantee after that. There is no continuing guarantee for the pensioners now. After that, as with any other funded pension scheme, everything will depend on the performance of the fund and what return it wins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, in the case of final salary linked schemes, a great deal, such as the future pay of employees, is within the control of the employer and the employees themselves. That is another reason why the Government cannot conceivably continue to stand behind the scheme regardless of the level of liabilities that may emerge as a result of future pay settlements. Various assumptions would have to be made about the likely rate of inflation and so on. All that the Government can do is to put things in order at the moment of sale. Thereafter the performance of the fund is up to the trustees, the extent of the liabilities depends on negotiations within the company, and judgments have to be made about the rate of inflation and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one makes a valuation for the purposes of a topping-up payment to put a fund back in order—in this case quite a substantial payment is involved—that implies that at the time the payment is made one will do one's best to make a judgment about all future liabilities. As things stand at present the fund does not appear to be in a condition to meet its future liabilities. What topping up is necessary? That is where the actuarial judgments come in. But it is a matter of judgment. There are uncertainties about it. We can only say that the Minister, acting on advice, will reach the best possible judgment about the appropriate level of payment once he has received the proceeds from the sale of shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the amendments, I do not accept that the insertion of the phrase "fully to fund"—it is in any event a phrase of rather doubtful meaning—will be of any help. Nor will it add a great deal to put two people under a statutory obligation to determine the correct amount jointly. We undertake to consult closely NFC Trustees Limited. We hope and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1828</span>
expect that in the event there will be agreement between the Government and the trustees about the appropriate level of the payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking to consult is a step in the right direction. However, I cannot accept the role reversal that the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to press upon the Opposition. It is no part of our contention that it is easy to determine how to fund the pension schemes. In the course of discussion on some of the later clauses the Parliamentary Secretary may regret some of the arguments that he has used. We may use precisely the same arguments to stress how difficult it will be to determine to what extent the historic railway pensions may be said to be funded at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not argue that it is an easy matter. We accept that the judgment will be difficult. We accept that it will not be easy for the Minister or for the trustee of the fund to decide what the cost will be. But we do say that when this public asset is sold off it would be far better if those who buy it could be confident that the pension schemes are funded. When the conditional offer of shares under which the first so many million pounds will be available for funding the road service historic pensions—is made those who are considering buying the shares should be confident that if the sale goes through they will not have a continuing liability to deal with the road service pensions. That is the position. It is no good suggesting that we have taken the view that that is easy, and that we are being unrealistic. We are not being unrealistic. We accept that it is hard to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of our argument is simply this. If the Minister comes to a conclusion that does not agree with that of the trustee, the trustee may well feel under an obligation to make known his difference with the Minister. If that difference between the two were as much as £1 million or £2 million that would act as a deterrent to the purchase of the shares. At least it might lead those who sought to buy the shares to calculate what their value actually was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that one could avoid that difficulty merely by not touching upon it in the Bill. If the Bill says that the Minister will seek an agreement, that will help. It may well resolve the difficulty completely. We accept that the trustee of the fund
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0992">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1829</span>
may have actuarial advice different from the advice given to the Minister. But such things can be resolved. They are resolved at present. The present understanding as to how railway pensions should be funded involves three sets of people, who may have different actuarial views, getting together and reaching an agreement. That being the case, I think that the same could be done here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making a total valid point, and one that arises not from some Opposition myth or bogey man but from the Minister's declaration. Out suggestion would help (better) to achieve his aim. The Parliamentary Secretary has not convinced me that by merely avoiding mentioning the subject in the Bill one can avoid the pitfall. The pitfall is there. It is for him to tell us what he would do, in the event of the amendment not being carried, if the trustee were to say that he disagreed with the Minister's calculation and felt that he had an obligation as a trustee to declare that difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I accept that it should be possible to reach agreement. However, actuaries do not always do so. One trusts that they will do their best to reach agreement on this occasion. The Minister will be using the Government Actuary and will have to make it clear what actuarial advice he has received. If there were a difference, so be it. If the trustee felt obliged to say that he had come to a different conclusion, that would be unfortunate. But unless some huge difference emerged, it would not be catastrophic. Would-be investors would know from their experience that actuaries</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>do not always agree. Plainly, the two sides have a different interest here. From the point of view of the managers of the fund and the employees of the company, I accept that the higher they can bump up the Government's figure, the better it will be for them. There is a possibility of the pension fund being so well funded that it will outperform the present obligations and produce surpluses for distribution to pensioners in future years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments are related, but have different purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 316 seeks to make clear and specific what is at present implicit in the clause, namely that if the sale of shares or payments under subsections (3) and (4) does not produce sufficient money to fund the relevant pension obligations under the road service historic pension scheme arrangements, that obligation will fall to be met by the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this is probably somewhat narrower than may have been thought to be the case when the amendment was tabled, as the Minister has now made it clear that at flotation the first offer of shares will be conditional upon sufficient shares being sold to meet the Minister's actuarial assessment of the cost of funding. Nevertheless, it is still an important point of detail that there should be no doubt at that time as to where the responsibility shall lie if what is realised does not fully fund and the Minister nevertheless goes ahead with the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, the difference to which we referred on the previous amendment, and which adds point to this one. That is the difference which may exist as to the sum needed to complete the fund. On that difference, possibly, could turn the effect of the amendment. It is intended to have the wider meaning that if in any circumstances the Minister goes ahead with the sale and carries out the transfer of public assets to private shareholders, those shareholders understand that they will be taking on a liability if the sale of shares and the aggregate amount paid to the pension fund as a result does not fully meet the relevant pension obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 217 deals with another issue which we believe is implicit, but certainly not explicit, in the clause. That is the position of those pension schemes now run by the NFC which are not convered by the definition of "relevant pension obligations" either in this clause or in clause 41, in other words, those which are run with no historical obligation attached to them either from road or from rail. It is a serious amendment, not a probing amendment, which seeks to ensure that the successor company has an obligation to continue those schemes and is not free, on taking over the NFC, to change the conditions attached to those schemes in any way that would worsen them. It is a clear, direct point which is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1832</span>
clearly a source of concern to the pensioners and to the trustees of the funds, and which, I think, requires no further explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only argument that might possibly arise would be that of whether this should be spelt out in the Bill. The Opposition are certainly in no doubt whatever about that point. At a time when so many questions will be hanging over the NFC pension funds and so many people will be seeking assurances in what is admittedly a complex area, where a fund is working without difficulties of any historic obligation and apparently meets the wishes of its trustees, the existing management of NFC and the existing pensioners, we believe that it should go ahead unchanged by the Bill. Moreover, the Bill will be the better for containing the guarantee that those pensions will in no way be worsened by the change or part change of ownership from public to private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) for clarifying the purpose of the two amendments. The first is certainly capable of a variety of meanings, although I intend no criticism of the drafting, as I appreciate the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the meaning and purpose of the amendments, both of which are entirely legitimate, have been explained, it is clear that they deal with separate issues and I shall handle them on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 316 seeks to ensure that if the proceeds of sale are not sufficient to satisfy any pensions obligation, the successor company will meet the balance of the obligation, I assume by making an immediate lump sum payment. However, as my right hon. Friend explained in his answer to the first group of amendments, that situation will not arise. Sale will not take place in circumstances in which the proceeds of sale are less than the payments to be made to the pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, therefore, we have no reason whatever to believe that such a situation may arise because at present on any well-ordered sale of the corporation's assets, the proceeds should comfortably cover any possible liability on the pension fund. Second, even if circumstances were to change and that judgment were to prove wrong, there would be protection against
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1833</span>
the sale producing less than is required to satisfy the pensions obligations. The right hon. Gentleman referred to a conditional sale, as it were, with a reserve price. In practice, the shares would be underwritten in order to ensure that the proceeds of the flotation would satisfy the sum required to meet the pensions obligation. The circumstances that amendment No. 316 is designed to cover therefore cannot and will not arise in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 317 raises a much wider issue. As the right hon. Gentleman said, it goes beyond any of the pension schemes covered by the Bill to deal with current service pensions of NFC employees and their position once the new company is formed. The most helpful response I can make is put clearly on record certain assurances, about the position of present employees and current service pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, so far as I am aware, there is no reason to believe that the current service pension liabilities are at present unfunded or in deficiency. It is an ordinary, funded pension scheme, proceeding perfectly normally, and there is therefore no problem with the current service pensions. Second, the successor company will take on all the obligations towards the NFC's employees under the present pension fund arrangements. It will therefore take over the present funding arrangements and the present pension entitlements, just as it will take over the other terms and conditions of employment of the employees.
The amendment seeks to ensure that once the company becomes a private sector company, the present rules of the pension scheme will be fixed and immutable. It will not be possible to change them to the detriment of the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the reason for a probing amendment to obtain the assurances already given about the pension fund. However, if the amendment were made it would put the employees in a far better position than they are in now, and in a better position than employees in any other pension fund. I have no reason to believe that anyone will want to change the rules of the pension funds to reduce the value of the pension entitlement, but as the rules now stand, if the freight corporation is empowered to vary the rules of the pension funds, so must its successor be. No doubt at the moment there is representation for employees about actuarial advice received. The NFC must be rep-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1834</span>
resented on the board of trustees, and the rules no doubt provide for circumstances in which the pension entitlement can be changed. If the rules provide for the pension entitlement to change, the successor company will be able to make whatever changes the freight corporation can make now. But I resist the idea of inserting into the Bill a further overriding statutory guarantee that at no stage in the future could the company's pension fund be varied to the detriment of the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not before me the precise rules of the pension arrangements. The present rules will continue to be the same in future. Whatever the present obligations are on the freight corporation under those rules will continue to be the obligations on the successor company. Whatever rights the freight corporation may have at the moment, under the rules, to change the scheme will be passed on to the new national freight company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To avoid spreading needless alarm I shall say that at present I have no reason to believe that the freight corporation has ever contemplated making changes which would worsen the schemes and that there is no reason why the successor company should see any need in the future to make such changes. Events can change, and there is no reason why the company should be under a permanent statutory bar against future changes. One trusts that such circumstances will not arise, and that in practice in future, as with most pension funds, any negotiated changes in those funds will tend to be for the improvement and not the worsening of the pension rights, But we cannot guarantee that, and this company and its pension fund must behave in future as any other pension fund does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is evident that I have missed a couple of steps in the Parliamentry Secretary's argument and I should like his guidance. He said a moment ago that if the aggregate moneys from the sale of the shares do not reach the amount needed to fund the back payments, there will be no sale. He said that quite categorically. I was listening very carefully. But that is not what the clause says. The clause says that the aggregate of moneys from the sale of the shares must reach a figure given in an undertaking. As I understand it, it is nowhere laid down that the figure given in that undertaking is equal to the amount which will fully fund
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0995">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1835</span>
the back payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like that to be clarified, because it is a crucial point of principle. The key word in clause 40 (1) is the word "towards" in line 29. The relevant words concerning payments to be made to pension schemes are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such payments towards the funding of those obligations as he may specify in the undertaking."</p></blockquote>
That is quite different from saying that no sale will be made if the aggregate moneys of those payments does not reach the figure required for the full funding of the back payments. That is the first question. For the second, I need to return to clause 36(3) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"References in this Part to the undertaking of the Corporation are references to all the property, rights, liabilities and obligations of the Corporation, whether or not of such a nature that they could be assigned by the Corporation."</p></blockquote>
I understand that to mean that the liabilities for the funding of the scheme are transferred to the shareholders of the successor company and that those liabilities are transferred in perpetuity. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first question was a long one and it reopens the entire subject matter of the last debate. I accept that the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has put what I said in the most precise possible language and has accurately related it to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will give an undertaking on the payment that he proposes to make. He has explained the basis on which he will arrive at that payment and its purpose. We discussed in our last debate the difference between that and the phrase "fully funded". It is the Minister's intention—and it will be expressed in the undertaking—to make such payment as will put the fund in order and take the liability off the books. Under the Bill a sale cannot take place if the proceeds of sale are less than the figure specified in the Minister's undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the second question. All the corporation's liabilities will be transferred to the company. Because of the present nature of the pensions liability, the Minister proposes to make a payment that will take the present liability off the books of the company. But the successor com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1836</span>
pany—the holding company—will be the owner of NFC Trustees Limited and will be liable under its pension fund rules to meet its pension liabilities to the corporation's employees. It will have taken over those liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will be no more likely to be changed in the future than they are at present with the corporation. The corporation may have the power to change some of the liabilities. When it has that power, so will the company. We shall simply be putting the new company into the shoes of the present corporation and giving it an extra bonus as the result of the sale. To facilitate that sale, the Government will discharge some of the pension liabilities from the proceeds. We are under no obligation to do that, and previous Governments have never guaranteed them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had seen with blinding clarity exactly what the Government proposed to do and what the control mechanism would be. I now realise that it was a mirage which is evaporating quickly across the sands of the desert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the first amendment was not to ensure that the successor company should take some lump sum or sell off further assets to fund any pension obligations which, in the view of the company trustees, were not covered by the sale of shares. It was to make sure that responsibility lay with the successor company. My intention was that it would be up to that company to work out how it would discharge the liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That might be by annual payments from money that it had earned as a company. I cannot see anything in the amendment to justify the Parliamentary Secretary's assumption that it is intended to mean that it has a responsibility to meet that obligation by a funding arrangement. But that could be merely a difference of approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is a difference of understanding was made clear by the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary corrected me when I referred to the offer of the shares as a conditional offer, but that was an attempt to describe what was my understanding at that paoint. I believe that what the Minister said in previous debates on the amendments was that he would ensure that the sale did not go ahead until it could realise enough to cover the Minister's estimate of what was required to fund these historic road service pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0996">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1837</span>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took what the Parliamentary Secretary said to mean that the reason the sale would not fail to realise that amount was not that it was conditional and would be stopped as such, but that the sale would be underwritten. If that is correct, I shall be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary will explain how the underwriting process will work. To take very simple figures for purposes of clarity, supposing that the Minister's estimate of the cost of funding these historic road service pensions that he wants to see funded is £32 million and that the sale produces £30 million. Will there be some contractual arrangement which will ensure that the other £2 million is available to the fund trustees? Or is it the case that the underwriting arrangement will only be available to cover the difference between what the trustees subsequently says is necessary to meet the obligations where that is different from the Minister's own estimate? Is the underwriting arrangement to cover either or both of those circumstances? Secondly, what is the mechanism of the underwriting arrangement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 317, I advise the Parliamentary Secretary that my experience of industrial pensions is that most people who approach their pension fund representatives and trustees to inquire about the conditions of joining industrial pensions simply join on the basis that their rights will not be worsened. In other words, when as a draughtsman I joined an industrial pension scheme which required me to pay 7 per cent. of my salary into a pension fund, I was given the understanding that provided I met the conditions of the fund and did not leave before a certain date, that would produce for me a certain proportion of my average salary of the last five years as a pension, and I understood that that could not be worsened while my same employer was bound to the conditions of the scheme and I maintained my obligations under the scheme. I would have been alarmed—and this is why I believe some of the NFC's employees are now alarmed—when considering what would happen when the employer changed and the party with obligations set out in the original trust deed of the pension fund ceased to be the same party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the amendment is not asking for something that is not normally expected under pension arrangements but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1838</span>
is merely seeking to ensure that the successor company puts itself in the present position of the NFC in regard to its present employees and maintains the same guarantees to its pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that, because of their political point of view, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary clearly regard the change from the NFC to a privately-owned National Freight Company as the political equivalent of the big rock candy mountain. That is not how matters are viewed by the people working in the NFC. Few of them share the Minister's enthusiasm for the change, there are numbers violently opposed to it and a substantial proportion very doubtful about it. One of the matters about which they are doubtful, and I am sure that this applies to the BRS people, is whether what they regard as the security of their pensions, both the under-funded historic and the current pensions acquired in the public sector, will be honoured in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said that, other things being equal, they can expect them to be honoured by the successor company. That may be so. We are saying that, if the necessary sense of security is to be given to people being transferred out of the public into the private sector, it behoves the Minister to give them additional security, both practical and in essence, by accepting these two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If something goes wrong with the National Freight Company to such an extent that it cannot meet its pension obligations, the people employed by the company will find themselves in the cart. We seek to make sure that that does not happen, and that they are properly protected. That is a legitimate objective for anyone involved in this transfer of staff from the public to the private sector. Therefore, I genuinely cannot see why the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are not prepared to accept the amendments. They are all of a piece with what the Government intend and hope will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Parliamentary Secretary saying, "That's all right. There will not be any change. Nothing will be different". On earlier clauses we debated making provision for continued trade union representation on the board of the new company. That was specifically rejected
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0997">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1839</span>
by the Minister. It is not only the concept but the actuality of having trade union representation on the board that gives a sense of security. That is one element of the workers' sense of security that is being withdrawn. Therefore, it is wholly reasonable that we should advocate, and that the Minister should accept, these amendments which are intended to give the security which people see being withdrawn. If the diminution of security is as illusory as the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are saying, that is all the more reason why they should accept the amendments because they would impose no burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments are considered a burden on the privately owned National Freight Company, so be it. It ought to carry that sort of burden because, heaven knows, with all the provisions that are being made for the writing-off of debts and carrying forward tax losses, and so on—substantial benefits and assets are being carried forward—the least that the Government can do is allow these advantages to staff and pensioners to be carried forward too. They might to some extent offset some of the assets which are being transferred. The security of pensioners and staff is a legitimate burden which ought to be imposed on the new company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the questions in turn. First, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) asked about the nature of the underwriting process and how, in practice, I envisage this conditional sale will guarantee that the proceeds meet the undertaking to make payments into the pension fund. I have an imperfect knowledge of underwriting myself, so I hesitate to launch into a lecture upon it. But basically, when the share flotation is made, the undertaking to make a payment to the pension fund will be set at, say £32 million, and the share issue will be underwritten to a value of, say, £40 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result is that the sale cannot produce less than £40 million. Underwriting is a form of guarantee to the seller—a reserve price at an auction which the seller is bound to get. Once the underwriters have entered into the obligation to undertake the issue to a value of £40 million, if investors do not come forward, to that extent all the stock will be left in the hands of the underwriters. The underwriters will seek to avoid that position. That is the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1840</span>
judgment that they have to make. Nevertheless, the Minister's proceeds will be the £40 million for which the issue is underwritten. From that—his bottom price—he will discharge £32 million of obligations on the undertaking that he has given. That is what will happen in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the right hon. Gentleman about the position of the successor company. It will take over all the liabilities and obligations of the present corporation. If the first of the two amendments is designed to clarify that position and to make clear that the successor company will be a party to the pensions obligations carried at present by the NFC, I should like to stress that that is so. There is no way in which the successor company could avoid being put into the corporation's shoes and taking on all its liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question whether the schemes can be changed and the position of those in them at present. Before I launch on that aspect, I hope that nobody will raise an unnecessary alarm about it. We are talking about a solvent pension fund about which there is no cause for alarm or reason to contemplate any change at present. As for historic liabilities, there is a deficiency that is being funded satisfactorily by the corporation through annual payments of £2.5 million a year, and the Minister is offering to wipe out that deficiency on the sale of shares. Any concern felt by National Freight Corporation employees is groundless. We are speaking in very hypothetical and theoretical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) put the case that somehow the position is different when it is a nationalised funded pension as opposed to a private one. Where the trading sector is concerned, that is not so. The Governments in 1974 and 1978 expressly declined to enter into formal guarantees on the road-based pension. If employees believe that the security of their pensions somehow depends on the corporation's remaining nationalised, they are mistaken. Their pension rights depend on the fund and their entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness pointed out that someone might say, "When I was paying into my pension scheme I believed that no one could take it away." That is right. Past pension liabilities—that is, when one has paid into a fund that operates under certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0998">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1841</span>
rules—cannot be changed. The fund is built up to meet them. Sometimes an actuary will step in and say, "The fund is not at present in a position to meet all those past liabilities. It must be topped-up." The only way in which past pension entitlements can be lost is if a fund goes bankrupt. Unfortunately, that occasionally happens, but it requires a most woefully poor performance by the fund and probably neglect by the trustees and actuaries. However, it is extremely rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Theoretically, the position could arise under which future pension entitlements have to be varied. Let us suppose that there had been another five years of Labour Government; inflation could be running at 30 per cent. annually and wage settlements at 45 per cent., and the best available return on capital investment might be about 2 per cent. In those circumstances, most pension fund managers would seek to vary their members' future</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
