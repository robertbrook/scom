PRELIMINARY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment No. 8 proposed,</i> [<i>13 December</i>], in page 2, line 5, leave out the word 'and'.—[<i>Mr. Booth</i>].</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are considering also amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 8, after 'licences', insert 'and
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>h</i>) providing an appeal against a refusal by the London Transport Executive to enter into an agreement with a person other than the Executive for the provision of a London Bus Service'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to continue the arguments on clause 1 that we were developing in amendment No. 10. The Parliamentary Secretary, at the end of his contribution, made clear that the Government were prepared to accept after some considerable period of argument, our amendment to this now amendable clause.<br><br>
If amendment No. 10 is accepted there are certain consequential effects upon the rest of clause 1 which we think are worthy of consideration. Therefore, we welcome the Minister of Transport to the Committee this morning. I do not know whether he has anything interesting to tell us from the Cabinet about transport; we will wait for his contribution.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will undoubtedly have read the report of the proceedings of the last sitting of the Committee and will have seen that a number of substantial points came out, certainly in the discussion of amendment No. 10—so much so that it convinced the Government to accept that amendment, even though at earlier stages in our discussions, certainly on the first day, that was not necessarily the argument that prevailed upon them. Therefore, we feel that we have made the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
case for the amendment; it certainly has some consequential effects that are important for us to bring to the attention of the Committee.<br><br>
It also bore out the point that we should have had the advice of the Minister of Transport. He may have been able to help us on another matter that caused some concern namely the legal intent and interpretation of clause 1. Perhaps he will be able to answer some of the appeals made last time as to exactly what is the legal interpretation of the clause, either now or on the debate on clause stand part—I am pleased to see the Minister nodding his head to that.<br><br>
You certainly gave us some very valuable guidance Mr. English, with which we tended to agree, that there was clearly a legal implication in passing the clause —hence our arguments for amending it.<br><br>
I was going to deploy some of the arguments, but since the Minister has indicated to the Committee that he intends to clarify the matter, I will not pursue the argument any further, in the interests of time. I hope that that is taken as a pointer by the Committee that it is not our intention to delay, but to get clarification on the clause. I shall not deploy some of the arguments that I spelt out about the legal implications of clause 1, but will wait for the indication from the Minister.<br><br>
I hope that I can assume that he may give that indication during the discussion on this amendment. I do not know whether that is his intention. The Minister seems to be saying that it is not. Perhaps I was being too charitable in not deploying the arguments at this stage, but I will take it as an indication that the right Hon. Gentleman will give his view in the clause stand part debate and I will listen with interest to what he has to say.<br><br>
The amendment before us makes clear that there is the intention to have an appeal—and this is spelt out in clause 28—against decisions of the London Transport Executive on applications which have to be made to them under the present law by any one wishing to operate a service in London.<br><br>
The amendment simply adds to the purpose and intention of clause 1 and indicates that there will be an appeals system introduced in the London Transport area, and that anyone making an application for a bus service in that area will now have a means of appeal that was previously denied them under the London Transport
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
Act. The metropolitan commissioners were not involved in the granting of bus licences. It is now the intention that if the London Transport Executive, which has received the application for a licence on a route for which it has some responsibility, denies such an application, the applicant has a right to appeal to the metropolitan commissioners, who will decide whether that decision is valid. It is the setting up of an appeals system, now acknowledged in clause 1 and accepted by the Government, which causes us further difficulties of interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to my hon. Friend, with respect, that he is oversimplifying the situation. He says that there is under the current law no process of appeal against the London Transport Executive where it refuses to make an agreement with someone who wishes to operate a service, but that is true only of those who have started to operate since the present provisions came into effect. There are other operators who operated in London prior to that, and who, we were told by the Parliamentary Secretary, still have a process of appeal open to them. Therefore I put it to my hon. Friend that it is necessary to qualify what he is saying in respect of those operators.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. That is a point that I intended to make. It is a matter of trying to speak and at the same time jump a number of the arguments in view of the Minister's indication that he will reply on the clause stand part debate. I was still desperately trying to catch up with other facts of the argument, perhaps losing some of the coherence. Nevertheless my right hon. Friend's point is valid, and indeed is the point that I had noted down. The LTE was judge and jury with the single exception pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary in his intervention at our previous sitting. He said that there were other bus people who had been operating before the authority was given to the London Transport Act and who were guaranteed the rights and protections of appeals. I am not sure whether the appeal was heard by the metropolitan commissioners, but certainly the operators had the right and were not treated in the same way as any new applicant to provide a bus service within the area of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
responsibility of the London Transport Executive.<br><br>
Nevertheless that does not affect too much our argument that since the Bill has provided for an appeal to the commissioners against the rejection of any application to run a service in the London Transport area we should spell out what criteria the commissioners should consider in judging those appeals.<br><br>
Part of our argument is that if the Bill affects other legislation relating to the criteria to be considered clause 1 should include an indication of consequential changes made upon the acceptance of the amendments. Indeed, the whole purpose of clause 1 is to point out the purpose and intention of the Bill and to outline the consequential changes, both on legislation and on the intended interpretations of those sections dealing with public service vehicles, bus licences and so on.<br><br>
The burden of our argument is that, by establishing and including in this clause that the intention of the Bill is to establish an appeals system, certain other matters flow from it which require the amendment of other parts of clause 1. That is a point which we clearly have to establish and justify to the Committee.<br><br>
In looking at the interpretations given in the debate and the intentions of clause 1, we feel quite strongly that the criterion used is one which clearly needs to be spelt out. Indeed, it is the intention of the clause to change considerable parts of it. If one looks at the intention of clause 1, namely to establish an appeals system, there are changes that will follow from that.<br><br>
Previously, commissioners considering appeals did not have a great deal to guide them. That is certainly true of London Transport which had to decide whether to grant a bus licence.<br><br>
I must confess to being a little confused as to how the commissioners dealt with previous applications, because part of our argument is that the commissioners in other parts of the country had clear guidance from other pieces of legislation as to what should be considered as the public interest in determining whether a service should be provided. That is clearly spelt out in other pieces of legislation, but in the case of London Transport we have a unique situation. That point was made by the Parliamentary Secretary when he was justifying why this form of appeal had to be included in relation to London Trans-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
port. He said at our previous sitting:
<br><blockquote><p>"London is in a different category from the rest of the country. We all know that the LTE has a statutory position which is not matched anywhere else in the country. When we consider the problem of London, therefore, it is clear that unless we go in for a major reform of the entire arrangements of the London Transport Executive, we shall have to deal with London in a special way. In fact, when considering the Bill we were anxious to deal with London in a fairly limited way. We do not wish to engage now on a major examination of the role of the LTE and its function."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 13 December 1979; c. 90.]</p></blockquote>
That is a clear indication of what the Minister was thinking. The Government feel that the uniqueness of the London transport system would require major changes for London Transport obligations, if we were to institute in London the radical changes envisaged in the Bill for the rest of the country. Therefore, they seek solely to achieve the same purpose by adding this amendment. There will be an appeal to commissioners against any refusal of a bus service which may have been considered by criterion other than that in the Bill. For example, this would apply if the London Transport Executive were to continue to consider any applications for a bus service in its area on the basis of the criteria in the Transport (London) Act 1969 which spells out the criteria that commissioners were to take into account in determining the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just remind the hon. Gentleman of what he is doing? He is moving an amendment with which we are taking an amendment to add as a purpose of the Bill a reference to something which comes later in the Bill. I do not particularly mind where we have the argument about it, but I should have thought that later on, it would be much easier to amend the substance of it and to discuss it. If it is discussed too widely here, it will narrow the debate on the subsequent clause.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. May I draw to your attention, Mr. English, something that the Parliamentary Secretary said about this matter last week? He said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We are considering now whether we should add to clause 1 this restriction of provisions later contained in clause 28."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 13 December 1979; c. 90.]</p></blockquote>
It is therefore clear to me that the Minister considers that if we put in the amendment, it will be arguable that we cannot amend clause 28 to go very much wider than has been envisaged up to now in its drafting. I submit to you, Mr. English, that since the Parliamentary Secretary has made clear that the Government have not formed firm conclusions on the form or the scope of the appeal provision, this is the appropriate time to discuss the scope of clause 28 in so far as it could be limited by the carrying of the amendment.</span></p>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for pointing out that phrase to me. I had not noticed it before. Let me make clear that the words in <i>Hansard</i> are either a misreporting of the words I used or an accurate reporting of a slip of the tongue. Maybe the words I should have used are "this description". I think that the full tenor of my remarks at the previous sitting was that this was an accurate description—if the word is used as it was a few lines earlier—of the later provisions and I was not intending to imply that this clause would in any way restrict the scope of clause 28, which is the substantive clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly take on board the point which the Minister is making, but I am in some difficulty about the procedures which were forced on us by the Government. We are in the difficulty of determining exactly what is the intent of clause 1. The Minister has now said that he has no intention of giving us any indication, at least until we reach the clause stand part debate of the legal interpretation of the clause. That inevitably means, as we know from past experience, that one has to argue the case now because it may be a little late in the day when we come to the debate on clause stand part. There can be no more amendments to the clause once we have reached that stage.<br><br>
If the Minister is telling us that the legal intent of clause 1, which we can see from the debate is important, will not be given until the clause stand part debate, we shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
be denied the opportunity to influence clause 1, which is purposely put into the Bill to give guidance to commissioners and the courts on the intention of the Bill. That was made absolutely clear to in the last debate. We were told "If the clauses do not make clear what it means, please look to the intentions of clause 1 which will tell you what it is to do". The example given by the Parliamentary Secretary was to make it easier to get a licence. That might encourage him, but it certainly does not encourage us if those are the consequences of making it easier. A major part of our argument is that by doing that, one may well reduce the amount of public services available and that is one important difference between us in the interpretation of what will happen as a consequence of this Bill.<br><br>
We are in a difficulty if we cannot have the legal interpretation of this important clause, which is designed to give indications to commissioners who may not have experience. If we have a new appeals procedure in a new area, which is the major change affecting transport in the London Transport area, it is important for us to establish for those at the court of appeal, in this case the commissioners, exactly what is intended by clause 1.<br><br>
Indeed it is part of our argument to show the Committee that by accepting the amendment there will be an appeal against the decision of the London Transport Executive, and the grounds on which commissioners will decide appeals may be decidely different from those considered by the London Transport Executive, because of the obligations that the Bill places on the body that is to be involved is considering appeals.<br><br>
That is an important area which we believe that we have to bring out. It might have been better for us to have dealt with that at the end of the clauses, but that has been denied us.<br><br>
It has been forced on the Opposition by the decision not of the Chair but of the Government. This is not a difficulty made on the interpretation of the amendment and looking for an easy scapegoat, perhaps, by the Chair or people who have to select amendments. In this case it is a direct political decision of the Government not to allow this procedure to be dealt with at the end of the clauses.<br><br>
Therefore, we are faced with this most difficult situation of having to maintain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
arguments of some substance, as clearly there must be some substance as this amendment was not originally down to be debated or even accepted by the Government. Now it is. So we have established that there are arguments of substance, but we have to do it within the interpretation of the Chair whether we are in order. If we make the argument, it is pointed out to us that we must make it directly to the appeal, and if we do not make it directly to the appeal, this could well condition the argument of time that will be allowed when we discuss the clause that deals with this; namely clause 28. But we are not debating the full merits of the argument to the appeal, because the Parliamentary Secretary made clear at the last sitting that:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have not closed our minds on the precise form of appeal."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 13 December 1979; c.93.]</p></blockquote>
So it is not even yet clear in the Government's mind what will go in the appeal. The Parliamentary Secretary said that this was not yet determined, not yet clear in their mind; they were without a definite idea as to how that will be. That will come when we get to clause 28.<br><br>
But I am bound to say, having established that it is to be put in the purposes of the Bill—to guide the appeal people, that is what clause 1 does—the Minister introducing it says that it is still not clear in their mind how it will be done. Yet clause 1 is to guide him when he comes to the appeal. He will not be reading the <i>Official Report</i> of the Committee when he decides the appeal—I think that is well-established practice—or indeed the <i>Official Report</i> of the debate on the Floor of the House. He will read what is in this Bill. That is our difficulty, as we have shown in deploying our argument.<br><br>
We will come to clause 28 and deal with the details of the appeals procedure and the Government's ideas in due course. At the moment the basis of our argument is that if there is a difference—what I feel would be considered a fundamental difference—in the criteria to be applied by the London Transport Executive in determining whether a licensing system is to be granted and one that is to be determined by the metropolitan commissioner on appeal, from that follows that the duty on the London Transport Executive should be changed—namely, the obligation to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
provide a comprehensive and coordinated transport system—if, as appears, we are intent to reduce the powers of the metropolitan commissioner in order to achieve that obligation which we have placed in other legislation upon it.<br><br>
I do not know how we are best able to deal with this. An amendment was put down, which has not been selected by the Chair, which expressly brought out that point; namely, that section 1 of the Transport (London) Act 1969, which lays upon the Greater London Council the general duty:
<br><blockquote><p>"to develop policies, and to encourage, organise and, where appropriate, carry our measures, which will promote the provision of integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services for Greater London."</p></blockquote>
It is quite clear what kind of criteria the London Transport Executive will use, as it has done in the past, in determining whether an application for a bus licence should be granted. It is quite straightforward. There is a lot of precedent for it. That is the basis on which people make application. Indeed, it may well be the kind of criterion that the Minister has pointed out which has deterred people from making application. Part of the argument of the Government is that more people would have applied for a bus licence if these other matters had not discouraged them. Applicant looking at clause 1 would probably feel we are not likely to get into an integrated transport system because it means cross-subsidisation and because it will not have the competitive element which the Government feel needs to be introduced in this case.<br><br>
That is the case for the argument of the London Transport Executive, which, in fact, is quite clear and has led to the London Transport people writing to us. I have a letter from Sir Reginald Goodwin, who is the Labour Leader of the Opposition in the Greater London Council. He makes clear in his letter to those of us who have written that it will make it much more difficult for a public transport system to be provided in London.<br><br>
The argument for this side is that if the appeal commissioner is to be instructed by clause 1 of the Bill, which we are seeking to amend, to consider criteria other than those given to the London Transport Executive, we are, frankly, in some considerable difficulty, and it is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
responsibility of the Government to follow through and either change the statutory obligation placed on the London Transport Executive or change the definition of "public interest". If the Government were leaving things as they were it would perhaps be understandable and we would have an anomaly, but they are not doing that. The repeal schedules in the Bill make clear that sections 132 to 140 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 are being repealed, and it is no coincidence that the Government have chosen those sections to repeal because they are the sections that define "public interest".<br><br>
We shall be coming back to this part of the debate, undoubtedly, later on the definition of "public interest", for which we had another amendment down which has not been accepted. Section 135 spells out most clearly the sort of transport system required and the public interest to be considered when planning this transport system.<br><br>
I am not going to waste time by reading it out—it would be quite easy to read it out—but I would refer hon. Gentlemen to that Transport Act which differs distinctly from what is proposed in the Bill. Clause 5 of the Bill is the Government's definition of what the public interest is. Here is, presumably, the criterion that the commissioner—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is doing his best to achieve some object, but I really cannot have a discussion on clause 5 at this stage. We shall come to it, although, apparently, not quickly. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman restricts his arguments to explaining why he wishes this extra purpose to be added here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a difficulty not of our making. It is a combination of reasons why we are in this difficulty and not of our making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so, but the hon. Gentleman has deployed that argument. He is now beginning to repeat himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The repetitions in this Committee have led to substantial changes, from whatever direction they have come or for whatever reason. All I am pointing out here in the reasons for the amendment on this section is that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
say that it is an important part of the intention of the Bill—namely, to provide an appeal. If we provide an appeal, the rest of clause 1 goes on to state that there will be consequential changes. That is in the definition, as anyone can see. I refer you, Mr. English, to clause 1 which states those parts of the Bill which will be changed by the intentions in clause 1—namely, on interpretation.<br><br>
The Government have said that they will accept that the intention of the Bill is to institute an appeal procedure in clause 28. It is the contention of this side of the Committee that if the appeals procedure is accepted as an intention of this Bill, and if it is to be a guidance to those who do the appeals—namely, the commissioner or, indeed, the lawyers who may be involved in court situations—we should make clear here that the criteria on which appeals will be judged are different from those which presently exist, just as there is a difference in the definition of what a public service vehicle is in the respective pieces of legislation prior to this. The Bill tells us that, if one now considers road service licences or classification of public service vehicles, the definitions in other pieces of legislation will be as so defined in this Bill.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
That is the same line and trend of argument as we are developing from the appeal. If one accepts that there is an appeal, we are now arguing that there is a consequential effect on the criteria which will be used. If that is so, the other pieces of legislation which must be changed include the 1969 legislation, which was the guidance to the commissioners involved as to what would be considered the public interest, which is changed by clause 5 of the Bill. Precisely the same kind of thinking and logic is involved in clause 1—namely that one spells out the intent; that is, to put in the appeal—and then one spells out the consequential changes. If we have established that there is an appeal, I am only trying to argue the next stage of it. You have not accepted our amendment, Mr. English. You advised us that if an amendment was not accepted it did not mean that it was rejected; it meant that it was not for the convenience of the Committee or it might not be in order. I fully accepted that point.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not quite what I said. If an amendment is not selected, it is simply not selected. There is no need to import another word like "rejected". It is for the Committee to reject amendments when they have been moved if it wishes to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did not my hon. Friend think that the Parliamentary Secretary's answer to me at the last sitting of the Committee was inadequate in the sense that the explanatory memorandum on the first page says that,
<br><blockquote><p><i>"Clause 1</i> sets out the purposes"—</p></blockquote>
"the" purposes; not "some" purposes—and yet the wording of clause 1 contains the word "include"? Those two things are at variance with each other. The first sounds like a complete statement of purposes whilst the first line of clause 1 sounds, and indeed is, like a selection of purposes.<br><br>
Would my hon. Friends agree with me that this causes complete confusion, because the Parliamentary Secretary, when he was replying to me said in c.89,
<br><blockquote><p>"There is nothing sinister about the selection from clause 1 (1) (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) of the principal purposes which have been listed. They were believed by the Government and by the parliamentary draftsmen to be principal purposes and were set out accordingly."— <i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 13 December 1979; c.89.]</p></blockquote>
But the Parliamentary Secretary never gave us any criteria at all as to why he believed that some were principal selections and others were not. Is not this one of the roots at least of my hon. Friend's difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can expand any further on that. That has brought us to what is a considerable difficulty for the Committee. It started from the whole interpretation and acceptance of this clause, even though the Minister makes clear that there are precedents in other pieces of legislation for doing the same. That does not relieve us of the difficulty which has clearly been shown in the debate.<br><br>
We shall certainly take on board, Mr. English, the point which your are making, but it seems, nevertheless, that we have established a case that there are different criteria to be used. The Bill itself by putting in clause 5 a different interpretation from that in section 135 of the Road

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
Traffic Act 1960 would, as we argue, change other parts of other pieces of legislation. If it is valid to accept our amendments here, it is equally valid to make clear in the Bill for those who seek for guidance that indeed the criterion of "public interest" is changed by the Bill as well.<br><br>
I can well understand that the Government might not want to say that we are changing the "public interest" or even drawing the conclusion that it is less than what existed in other Bills. Nevertheless, it is a consequence, particularly, of pointing out the appeal system. Perhaps that is why it was not in the intentions of the Bill in clause 1 to begin with. I think the Minister could help us more than the Chair in this case I do not reflect at all on the Chair by that remark. The Minister could make clear that he would be prepared to help us out of this difficulty by giving an indication that he would put a provision in clause 1 now or later.<br><br>
The Minister could help us a lot more than he has done up to the present. He certainly does not make it any easier by reserving comment; I appeal to him to reconsider his decision and to give us an opportunity to hear his opinion of the legal interpretation of clause 1. Otherwise we are bound to continue to try to probe, as we have done at earlier stages, to find out exactly what it means, which will waste a lot of time. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee finds itself in some difficulty. On reflection, the Minister may regret the lack of forethought which went into the drafting of clause 1, which, as far as London Transport is concerned, the Government are attempting to correct by afterthought—not even the Minister's afterthought but the afterthought of my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) who proposed the amendment.<br><br>
There are one or two things which, as a London Member, I should like to find out from the Minister. One is what criteria were applied in picking the items to go in clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>). With regard to London Transport, there is the provision of a new appeal procedure. I emphasise "new" and not "replacement" because there always has been one. We would like to know why the London Transport proposal was not considered of sufficient sig-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
nificance to get itself into clause 1. We have been told that it is of great significance. It seems to me that one of the consequences of the introduction of the provision into the Bill is that the urban transport set-up will get into an even bigger mess than it is now, and God knows, it is bad enough already. The position is that we are being told that the clause will exist for the guidance of the courts; so the Parliamentary Secretary told us in c.80 last Thursday.<br><br>
The other problem, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has pointed out, is that the guidance for traffic commissioners which is available in the rest of the country will, if there are consequential amendments to other pieces of legislation, not be there.<br><br>
I suggest—the Minister can confirm or deny this—that one of the reasons why we find ourselves in this difficulty is that the whole idea of introducing the appeal procedure was really an afterthought; and it was an afterthought which did not even get into the consultation document which went out on the Government's other proposals. The consultation document was issued, I believe, in July, and it made no reference whatever to this change in the London Transport situation. I have made inquiries of London Transport—that itself, as anyone trying to find out about bus or train times will know, is a singularly difficult exercise—but have discovered that it was belatedly consulted about this proposal as late as September. I do not know and, neither do you, Mr. English, when the Bill was drafted. I suggest that a lot of it was well down the slipway before London Transport was actually consulted. We should like to know from the Minister what response he got from London Transport when it was consulted about this proposal. I should like to know further from the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, since he is the only one listening, what consultation took place with the GLC and what response was received by the Minister or his Department from the GLC. It seems that the probable genesis of this proposal is that it sprang from the present regime at the GLC.<br><br>
I should like to try to show that there has been a substantial shift in opinion on the GLC, which has some marginal responsibility for London Transport, which has led to the proposal coming forward. On 14th November 1979 the GLC rejected London Transport's £600 million

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
budget, stating <i>inter alia</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I help the hon. Gentleman? He has asked what was the view of London Transport. I made inquiries and my understanding is that London Transport accepted this proposition. I am not saying that it was necessarily enthusiastic about it, but it accepted it. I think that may help to shorten the hon. Gentleman's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One further point. The Minister no doubt will have to consult his officials again to find out whether London Transport found the actual machinery proposed in the Bill acceptable and whether it was consulted about the form of appeal. The point I am trying to make is that on 14th November 1979 the GLC rejected London Transport's budget as unacceptable in its whole approach. That was quite a remarkable situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So remarkable, in fact, that I do not see its relevance to this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to demonstrate its relevance. I have thought very carefully about keeping within order. I shall seek to deal with a matter I have spoken about in the House on a number of occasions, which is germane to the whole issue. I refer to the introduction of a further body with responsibility for London Transport. It seems that that is in order, because we are discussing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it is. It may well be in order on clause 28, but, as I say, the scope of this amendment is rather narrow. I have allowed the debate to be moderately wide, but the hon. Gentleman is deploying an argument that he might wish to deploy on clause 28 and may well find himself precluded from doing so because it has already been discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in more and more difficulty with this clause, as do my colleagues. When the question of what should or should not be debated on clause 1, as far as London Transport was concerned, was discussed at the last meeting of the Committee, it was generally indicated that we could debate the principle of the inclusion of this clause now the actual form of the appeal on clause 28. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
is the very existence of the appeal that concerns me. I care not a jot at this moment what form of appeal is to be established. I am concerned about the principle of the introduction of any new form of appeal and its consequences on transport provision in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That should certainly be discussed on clause 28. The hon. Gentleman is, in effect, saying that he is trying to oppose his right hon. Friend's amendment to discuss whether the appeal should exist.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected yet again, but I hope, in the light of that, that when we discuss the matter on clause 28 we shall not be ruled out of order on the grounds that the matter has already been discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That depends on what the hon. Gentleman does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are saying, Mr. English, that it is in the hands of the Committee now whether it discusses the principle of this inclusion at this point. If so, I should like to opt to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of this amendment is to add a purpose to the Bill. Because that matter is subsequently in the Bill, it is possible to do so. If it was not subsequently in the Bill, it would be extremely difficult to say that such an amendment would be in order. The hon. Gentleman is trying to say that the subsequent item in the Bill should not be there. If it should not be there, this amendment would be out of order. I do not see that it is possible to make that argument at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in increasing difficulty, particularly as I am thumbing through the proceedings of the last sitting, Mr. English, when you described my right hon. Friend's description of what we were trying to do on this clause as "perfectly correct" in c.62.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend allow me? In the light of your ruling, Mr. English, will you accept that our difficulty at this stage is that if we can add to new clause 1 only such purposes as are described in subsequent parts of part 1, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
means that any subsequent amendments to delete must have consequential effect and subsequent amendments which add to the purpose leave us in a position which we cannot deal with at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That could well be. No doubt if the Bill developed an imperfection of that character, that would be dealt with on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To return, Mr. English, to c.61. of the last sitting, it was my understanding from your comments that we go into a general discussion on this part of the Bill. If it would help, I should say that the point I wish to raise is wholly related to the question of the multiplicity of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. My remarks in c.61 that we could have a wide-ranging debate related to the clause stand part, debate which follows this, and the subsequent amendment. Until we reach the clause stand part debate this wide-ranging debate cannot take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I seek to do at this point—it is relevant and related directly to the amendment which my right hon. Friend has proposed—is to deal with the question of the multiplicity of organisations in London responsible for London Transport. This sub-section is the source of the introduction of yet another organisation. I would not wish to raise that point again, either on the clause stand part debate or on clause 28, if we could get it out of the way now, because in many senses it is a separate issue from the points we should probably wish to raise on clause 28 itself or indeed on the clause stand part debate on clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am afraid he could not guarantee that every other member of the Committee would not wish to raise the issue at a later stage. The situation is quite simple. There is a clause 28; it contains certain matter, which does not happen to be mentioned as a purpose of the Bill in this clause. It is perfectly valid to argue that it should be a purpose of the Bill and that the words in amendment No. 10 should be added, but it is not thereby in order to go much further and start arguing the merits of clause 28 itself.<br><br>
As the hon. Member's right hon. Friend said, it may be that clause 28 would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
deleted from the Bill, in which case if this were added now, it would have to be taken away again. But that is a consequence of what we discuss on clause 28. All these matters may well be perfectly in order on clause 28. They sound to me, somewhat off the cuff—as if they might be in order—but they are certainly not in order now.<br><br>
All that the hon. Gentleman is supposed to be arguing at this stage is whether this purpose should be added since, clearly, it is mentioned in clause 28.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 is not related to the other parts of the Bill in that it is peculiar to London and, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the arrangements of the transport system in London are unique.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank Heaven!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and that is one of the reasons why I am rather obsessive about it, if you will forgive my obsession on this matter, Mr. English. I would hate to make London Transport even more unique and I fear that this clause may achieve that.<br><br>
I think that the Committee is entitled to find out about the genesis of this clause and not just the new amendment which we are trying to introduce into clause 1. I think that the non-presentation of something on the lines of this amendment in clause 1 tells us something—or at least it says something to the suspiciously minded on the Opposition side of the Committee about the genesis of clause 28, particularly as clause 28 was not referred to in the original consultation document. Therefore, without getting into this question of the multiplicity of authorities in London which are responsible for lousing up the transport system—because that is just about what it amounts to—I would like to try to demonstrate some of the late genesis of clause 28 as I understand it from what has been going on within the GLC, if that would be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might assist the hon. Gentleman if I explain to him that the only changes we are making in London are to give a right of appeal to post-1969 operators similar to that which pre-1969 operators already have when they fail to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
reach an agreement with London Transport. Other than that, this Bill makes no changes whtever to the statutory position of London Transport. The Bill is concerned only with that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept everthing that the Parliamentary Secretary has said because what he has said demonstrates his failure to grasp what he is doing. If he has not understood, from what my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has been saying, he should have listened more closely, because what my hon. Friend has been trying to demonstrate is that if this apparently minor change is introduced in London it kicks the bottom out of the statutory obligations placed on the London Transport Executive. At the moment it has a duty to provide a comprehensive and coordinated transport system. In addition the traffic commissioners have to apply certain criteria to any applications which may arise as a result of the passage of clause 28, if it is accepted, and the new, amended, clause 1. In those circumstances, we would submit, firstly, that the London Transport Executive will find it extremely difficult to discharge its statutory function because it will no longer be able to co-ordinate if somebody else is making decisions which are related to coordination—in particular, the provision of a comprehensive service—and, secondly, that the traffic commissioners will have no sound criteria on which to judge any application within the London area.<br><br>
That is by way of digression, as a result of the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention. I return to the question of the genesis of clause 28 and the late acceptance by the Minister of the proposition that the guts of clause 28 should be mentioned in clause 1. It is worth pointing out that we are very concerned that this proposal in clauses 1 and 28 should not be carried further than is stated at present and we would like an undertaking from the Minister that we shall not get some late introduction of a more extensive change because that in itself might cause difficulties as far as clause 1 is concerned.<br><br>
I must point out that as recently as 27 November the leader of the Greater London Council, Sir Horace Cutler, stated that the monopoly London Transport now enjoyed would go. It has never been the case that London Transport had a mono-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
poly and this change which is proposed may very well make some changes, but I do not think even the Minister in his wildest moments of euphoria would believe that that quotation from the leader of the GLC would be a fair description of the proposals which he is putting forward in the Bill. Therefore, as we believe that there seems to be a relationship between consultations with the GLC or, more particularly, the leader of the Conservatives on the GLC, and the original genesis of clause 28 and, consequently, the amendment to clause 1, we are seeking some assurances at this stage from the Minister that there will not be any more extensive amendments proposed to clause 28 or other clauses associated with it, which would render wrong—to use a short word—the amendment which my right hon. Friend has proposed.<br><br>
It is worth going on to report that on 4 December—and this is still related to the genesis and appropriateness of this clause—the policy and resources committee of the GLC considered a document which was tabled at that meeting in which it was stated that the London Transport Executive had been asked to provide discussion papers by 1 April 1980 on a number of things, including, first of all, private enterprise bus services—whatever that might mean. It seems to me that, in addition to the points I have made to date, it is extremely difficult for the GLC or London Transport to respond in any sensible and well-thought-out way to the late consultation which took place on this clause. Therefore, the Minister should seriously consider whether, in the light of the late and necessarily inadequate consultation—because neither the GLC nor London Transport on the strength of what I have been able to quote from their own document as recently as 4 December—these bodies are yet in a position to have responded sensibly to this consultation document or the consultation which took place outside the consultation document. They have not done the necessary studies about the likely effects. So it seems to me that we ought to consider whether the Minister can sensibly go forward with this proposition at the moment.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If he has any doubts—and he ought to have doubts in the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), has been saying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0074">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
about the consequential effects of clause 28 on this amendment to clause 1—I think it would be best if he were to reconsider the matter altogether, and think about what he can do to provide an adequate clause 1 which would properly reflect his intentions and the considered view of the two authorities which are predominantly responsible for making a mess of London Transport, to wit, the London Transport Executive and the GLC. In the absence of that it is extremely difficult, not only for him but for the Committee to consider this aspect of clause 1 and, at a later stage, what the effects of clause 28 will be.<br><br>
If we seem to be taking a lot of time in discussing this and other matters related to clause 1, it ought to be a salutary lesson to the Minister. It should demonstrate what a mess this Bill is as a result of the introduction of clause 1, and even more so the ill consequences which flow from his insistence—his absolute insistence which has nothing to do with the rulings by you, Mr. English, or by Mr. Lamond—his absolutely adamant and inconsiderate insistence that clause 1 be considered before all the other clauses in part I. If it were there as the catch-all at the end of part I we could wrap up these discussions in no time. We would certainly not be in the difficult position of having to wrangle with you. Mr. English, as to what is in order. If we had had the full, meaty discussion on clause 28 which your ruling—which we entirely accept—has made ineligible, we could, in the light of that whizz through the equivalent of clause 1, which would no doubt be about clause 32, or we could even go back to it and still call it clause 1. But this demonstrates that probably the best thing the Minister could do for the Committee, and to achieve achieving a sensible piece of legislation, is to reconsider—even at this late stage—when we shall debate the rest of clause 1. He should withdraw it so that we can use it as a sort of catch-all at the end of part I, so that we can wrap up the discussion in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I deal now with the full debate we have had on the amendment. One of the matters which still troubles the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is the question of the legal interpretation of this part of clause 1. I am referring to Clause 1(1) which sets out the purposes of part 1.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
I am glad to say that my off-the-cuff description of the legal effect of this part of the clause at the last sitting proves to be accurate upon consideration. The matter can be more fully investigated when we get to the clause 1 stand part debate. If we get to that debate at a time when the Cabinet is not in session my right hon. Friend intends to give a further authoritative ruling. Broadly the position is as I described it. If—but only if—there are doubts about the interpretation of later clauses the relevant authorities can have reference to the description of them in clause 1(1) for the purpose of interpreting the intentions of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful statement even if it is only a reiteration. It is a reflection of what the Committee said to the Minister at the last sitting. We fully accept what he has said, and we will wait for the interpretation in the later clauses. We thank him for his statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the appeals provisions for London, this amendment, as we have all agreed, is only describing what is to be found in clause 28. I think it would be to the advantage of the Committee when we have heard all the arguments, which we shall have done by the time we come to debate clause 28, to go at that time into the appeals criteria in the fullest detail. But I understand that hon. Members wish to have some indication of what we intend, and in particular, judging from the two speeches this morning, some clarification of the precise legal changes we are making and the relationship between this and the existing legislation. So I will give a brief description, which I hope will be of assistance when we come to debate clause 28 in due course.<br><br>
The main piece of legislation one has to turn to to discover the role of the GLC in London Transport and the exact statutory position on transport in London is the Transport (London) Act 1969. Certainly the duties of the GLC are laid out clearly in section 1 of that Act. The Bill makes no changes to that. It changes the appeal arrangements only by giving a new right of appeal to operators who have sought to come in since 1969 having failed to enter into an agreement with London Transport, or I should say, when they refuse an agreement by London Transport.<br><br>
Let me describe precisely what the present provisions are. It is to section 23 of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
the 1969 Act that hon. Members have to turn for the current statutory embodiment of the special provisions for public service vehicles in London. Road service licences are not required for London bus services, defined broadly as ones other than excursions or tours, on which passengers are both taken up and set down in Greater London. Instead, London Transport has merely to consult the relevant local authorities and the police before providing a new service and—here comes the important part—no other operator can do so except by agreement with London Transport. Services which were provided by other operators before 1969 have special protection. They need the consent of London Transport. They may appeal to the metropolitan traffic commissioners against a decision by London Transport.<br><br>
So, if I may attempt to clarify the point once more, the one change we are proposing to make to the 1969 Act in this Bill it is to extend to post-1969 applicants the right of appeal which pre-1969 operators already have under the 1969 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is stating that the Bill does not amend section 1 of the 1969 Act, but surely the part of the 1969 Act which sets out purposes and policies for this purpose is section 4. That is the part that deals with the London Transport Executive, and it is the London Transport Executive against whom the appeal is to be directed if we have understood the description of this Act up to now.<br><br>
In so far as he is referring in this connection to the parts that are being amended, surely those are covered by the repeal provisions of the Bill. At the bottom of the last column, "Extent of repeal" on page 69 there is an amendment to sections 23 (6) and 23 (7) of the Transport (London) Act 1969.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On page 69 there are repeals or amendments to section 23 and section 24 of the 1969 Act. I can only repeat that section 1 of the Transport (London) Act, which the right hon. Gentleman rightly says is the one which governs the basic statutory responsibility of the GLC, London Transport, and so on, is not repealed. I agree that that is not the right hon. Gentleman's point but, I am having difficulty in seeing the relevance of the right hon. Gentleman's point to what I have just said.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the appeal that we are discussing on amendments Nos. 8 and 10 an appeal against the London Transport Executive's refusal to make an agreement? If so, should not section 4 of the Transport (London) Act 1969 be regarded as the relevant section since it determines the role of the LTE in respect of an appeal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware—and I am subject to correction—that we are excepting section 4. At the moment there is a right of appeal for pre-1969 operators. The Bill gives the same right of appeal to new operators.<br><br>
Let me move to the next point, which is about the lack of criteria which we have set out for the traffic commissioners in London. That again follows the 1969 Act. No specific criteria are set out for the metropolitan traffic commissioners in the existing Act in determining pre-1969 appeals. What we are doing in this Bill is not inconsistent with the Transport (London) Act 1969. The contrast which the hon. Member is drawing is between the lack of criteria for the metropolitan traffic commissioners and the criteria we are setting out for provincial traffic commissioners. We are setting out new ones in clause 5. The agitation of the right hon. and hon. Members who are so concerned with this is that we are somehow undermining the whole transport system in London. We are not changing the basis upon which the metropolitan traffic commissioners already act in their existing rights of appeal. I am not evading the point which I think lies behind what has been said.<br><br>
In determining appeals in the light of the very broad discretion which they are given by the 1969 Act, we expect and we would desire the metropolitan traffic commissioners to be influenced by the general climate that the Bill creates. We would hope they would be influenced by the changed climate which will result, whereby those concerned with road passenger transport generally will be more receptive to new operators, new ideas, new services and a breath of competition in some areas. We trust the metropolitan traffic commissioners will not be unaffected by that change in atmosphere. No doubt they will look at clause 5 to see the criteria being laid down for other traffic commissioners, but as the Bill now stands they will not be bound as a matter of law by those criteria. So far as clause 28 is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0076">Image</span>

concerned, we are not changing the legal basis upon which the metropolitan traffic commissioners act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has been kind enough to say that he is not unaware ot the point we are making, but he really has proved our point. We fully accept his interpretation of the consequential effect of this amendment on the London Transport Executive's obligations. There is a difference between us as to what effect that will have on the obligation to provide integrated public transport system. We will leave that as a difference of intrepretation between us. But there are guides to these authorities in their appeals, namely the metropolitan commissioners. Hitherto the London Transport Executive knew quite well what it was refusing. It would not allow that breath of competition referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to undermine its statutory obligation to provide an integrated public transport system. In other areas of the country the commissioner was directed to the 1960 Act, which in my earlier remarks I tried to indicate to the Committee was absolutely relevant to the decision in this matter. I did not want to bore the Committee or to waste time by reading that, but I asked the Committee then to read the criteria embodied in the 1960 Act and to compare them with clause 5. At that time I was in doubt whether I was in order, but the Minister has referred to it. I will not delay the Committee by reading out the differences. Every hon. Member can look at them. The point is that there is a distinctive difference.<br><br>
Hence the reason that the Government have repealed the definition of the public interest in a transport system in section 135 of the 1960 Act. So any new commissioner in the metropolitan area, looking for guidance as to what the Government intend, will no longer have the opportunity to look at precedents in determining such licences in other areas as influenced by the 1960 legislation. That is being replaced by clause 5, which changes the guidance given to the commissioner. The Government are redefining the obligation on the commissioner and affecting his duty under clause 5. My hon. Friend referred to clause 1. I think the reference is to clause 5.</span></p>

<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point and I think we agree. We make no secret of the fact that clause 5 is a fresh definition of the criteria to be applied by provincial traffic commissioners. When we get to clause 5 we shall be delighted to discuss the differences between the new Bill and the criteria in the 1960 Act. They will be binding on provincial traffic commissioners. However, I think that we are now agreed that there is no legal change affecting the metropolitan commissioners. I concede—if that is the concession the hon. Gentleman wants, because I hope that the metropolitan commsioners will to some extent be guided or influenced by the change of atmosphere elsewhere—that they will not be bound as a matter of law by clause 5. We are not changing that.<br><br>
What will be the effects on London of these changed criteria? I do not accept that there is any inconsistency between, for instance, the breath of competition of which I talked and the general planning and coordinating role which the London Transport Executive had under the 1969 Act. I do not believe that the creation of a desirable transport system is inconsistent with sensible competition. I believe, and the Government beleive, that sensible competition can make a contribution to public passenger transport.<br><br>
Referring to the quotation from Sir Horace Cutler which the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) gave, the effect on London will be to change the nature of the present statutory monopoly of London Transport. We do not in any way seek to disguise or deny that the Bill will have an effect on the monopoly position. It is perhaps most accurately described as taking away from London Transport the right to retain a complete monopoly if the London transport Executive so wishes. At the moment, if London Transport wanted to, it could refuse to enter into an agreement with any other operator. Therefore, as the law stands, if London Transport wanted to it could maintain a complete statutory monopoly. Clause 28 will end that. London Transport will no longer have the right—as its own judge and jury, to repeat my phrase from the last sitting—to decide that it wants to retain a complete monopoly. It will be subject to appeal. The fact that the Greater London Council welcomes that—I am not surprised that it

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
does, at a time of considerable doubts and reservations which it has about the efficiency of the London Transport Executive in providing services—is reassurance to my right hon. Friend and myself, who believe that London can benefit, as the rest of the country can, from a re-examination of the present position of existing operators.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) said that we had not got clear minds on the form of appeal, because of what I said last time. The form of appeal—whether it is right to go to the metropolitan commissioners—can be debated again on clause 28. What I actually said was that we had not got closed minds. On this part of the Bill, as on all other parts of the Bill, our minds are clear as crystal and the Bill as it stands it clear and explicit in its provisions. But though clear, our minds are not closed. That seems to me an eminently desirable way for Ministers to face a Standing Committee, and when we get to clause 28, we shall certainly consider the further arguments that will then be relevant to the appeal procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. The Parliament Secretary did say that he would give way to me, and then he did not do so. I do not know whether that is a point of order.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a major song and dance about the point, but I should be grateful for advice on the time that is allowed before the doors may be closed. It is clear in the House what the time period is, and there may well be a time here in Committee. I should like to know, on perhaps a more important point—particularly for the Opposition in Committee who start off with fewer hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
should like to make a further submission on amendments Numbers 8 and 10.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A point of order has been raised.</span></p>
<p><i>Mr. Boscawen rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the question be now put.</p>
<p><i>Question put, that the Question be now put.</i></p>
<p><i>The Committee proceeded to a Division.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. You have called "lock the doors" and a member of the Committee has entered the room following that call. Is this in order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had said "Lock the doors", and they had not been locked. They are still not locked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. Is it in order for the man who should have locked the doors to have been asked by the Government Whip to go and find an hon. Member who was missing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must deal with that point afterwards.</span></p>
<p><i>The Committee having divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 9.</p>
<p>Members than the Government—exactly what time is to be allowed. If we are in difficulties again, with only one man in attendance, how do you propose to deal with closing the other door?</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The second part of that is hypothetical at this stage. The first part is, simply, that it is at the Chairman's discretion. The reason for that is obvious. Usually, hon. Members come in fairly quickly when a Division is called, when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
they are just outside in the corridor. In this case it was quite apparent that two hon. Gentlemen were not coming in immediately, one of them came in before the other and the one who came in last was, in fact, a new hon. Member. But the time period is entirely at the Chairman's discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I raise another point with you, Mr. English. I have just noticed that there is what may be a printing error.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman cannot raise just any point. We have agreed, That the Question be now put.</span></p>
<p><i>Question,</i> That the amendment be made, <i>put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before moving the amendment, may I draw your attention, Mr. English, to an error in the list of amendments before the Committee for today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. No, the right hon. Gentleman may not. We are on another subject. The right hon. Gentleman may do so after this.<br><br>
<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 10, in page 2, line 8, after 'licences', insert 'and
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>h</i>) providing an appeal against a refusal by the London Transport Executive to enter into an agreement with a person other than the Executive for the provision of a London Bus Service'.—[<i>Mr. Booth.</i>]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. It has come to my notice that there is an error in amendment No. 33 on the paper before us. It refers to the Transport (London) Act 1979 rather than "1969". I thought that it would be understood what was referred to and I thought that the difficulty with this was that the reference was to section 1 rather than to section 5. But the Parliamentary Secretary has confirmed that section 1 is totally relevant to the matter that we are discussing.<br><br>
Could we have your guidance, therefore, on the question of this selection? May we know whether you have considered, as I assume you have, of course, whether it is to be regarded as in order in this form in the light of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said? Could we have your view as to whether it be for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
convenience of the Committee now to discuss this amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I considered it in the text in which it was printed earlier, on the blue sheet, where it was printed as "1979". The hon. Gentleman has not told me whether that is a printer's error or whether that was an error by whoever put it into the Clerks' Department and, without that piece of information, I could not consider the selection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anything I have said paved the way for amendment No. 33, seeks to add section 1 of the Transport (London) Act 1969. As I sought to make clear in my speech, clause 1(1) does not apply and there is no intention whatever to amend it or repeal section 1 of the 1969 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is additional information, but the fact is that this was not just printed in this form on this white Order Paper; it was printed in this form on the blue sheet and it is up to hon. Gentlemen to check their own amendments. It is not the duty of the Chair to check an hon. Gentleman's amendment. If it had been drawn to my attention that in the view of the hon. Member his amendment had been misprinted, I would certainly have taken that into consideration, but that was not done yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much regret that that was not done. I certainly accept that "1979" was put on the blue sheet, but there is no such thing as the Transport (London) Act 1979. I thought it would be obvious that it was the 1969 Act and I thought the difficulty was that there was a reference to section 1. We have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter, as a result of the Government moving the closure of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Chair had to interpret what hon. Gentlemen meant by amendments that sometimes did not make sense, I am afraid that the duties of the Chair would be rather extensive. I think in this case we should proceed as the selection list states to amendment No. 34 with which we might discuss amendment No. 35.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I want to draw your attention
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0079">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
to what happened immediately before we took that vote on the closure motion. I accept entirely, of course, your ruling that it is a matter for the discretion of the Chair to decide how much time should elapse before you ask for the doors to be locked. On this occasion you took that decision and asked for the doors to be locked. One door was locked, but the other door was not locked and that was because previously the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) had spoken to the policeman at that door who had left the room, so that he was not here to hear your instruction to lock the door.<br><br>
I am not criticising the policeman; I can understand what happened, but, nevertheless, the result was that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan), who was not present in the room, was able to enter and was allowed to vote. Is this in order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that it probably is, but I shall certainly take advice on the point and if the hon. Gentleman is right I shall make a statement.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Bevan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. I was down the corridor telephoning and I did not, I am afraid, hear the policeman call. So I came back in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Mr. English. Was that Division not called in the corridor?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>An Hon. Member</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mills</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not? [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am asking on a point of order whether it was called clearly and loudly and audibly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I heard it being called. Certainly, one hon. Member came in as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to more amendment No. 34, in page 2, line 22, leave out subsection (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 35, in page 2, line 27, leave out 'without prejudice to subsection (3)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are advised that we are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
facing Ministers with minds that are crystal clear and open. The only demonstration that we have had of that up to now is that two amendments that we have pressed have been accepted as being perfectly in accordance with the intentions of their clear and open minds, although they were not previously included in the Bill. We have the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary before us for dealing with these amendments. He has said that he believes clause 1(1) is to be of assistance to the courts in interpretation. I believe that the Government accepted the previous amendment without tabling any amendment of their own to give guidance. We now have an amendment which has been accepted which they agree is desirable yet which gives no indication whatsoever to the courts as to how they are to interpret the measure.<br><br>
We are turning now to a further part of the Bill which undoubtedly could give the greatest difficulty not only to the courts in their interpretation role, but this House.<br><br>
I start, if I may, with subsection (3) which States:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Part and the 1960 Act shall be construed and have effect as if this Part (except so far as it textually amends any enactment) were contained in Part III of that Act."</p></blockquote>
I will not go any further at this stage because it gets even more complex as one goes on. But if we are to gather from that that it is necessary to have this subsection (3) so that one can interpret this Bill properly, if it becomes an Act, it would seem to me, on what may well prove to be a layman's reading rather than a lawyer's reading, that one has to examine part III of the 1960 Act.<br><br>
We have to ask the Minister—or the Parliamentary Secretary since the Minister is not here, but is probably somewhere outside in the corridor with his ears wide open in case there is a call for another Division—whether there is a mistake in the part in brackets. Does it mean:
<br><blockquote><p>"(except so far as it textually amends any enactment)."</p></blockquote>
or does it really mean,
<br><blockquote><p>"(except so far as it textually amends any enactment other than the 1960 Act)"?</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
Unless we have that cleared up, we cannot very well proceed to discuss this part of the Bill, or this amendment. It must surely be the case that, if the first part of subsection (<i>b</i>) is correct, this part of the 1960 Act should be so construed. Surely what is referred to in the qualification of the bracket must be related to Acts other than the 1960 Act. Before we discuss this, it might assist the speed of progress, which the Minister is obviously so keen to have, if we have an answer on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see the difficulty, but perhaps it would be convenient for me to make the point clear. The effect of subsection (3) is to put together part I of the Bill and part III of the 1960 Act. The licensing code—if I may so describe the law governing bus licensing—will be contained in both part I of the Bill and part III of the 1960 Act. The difficulty would arise if there appeared to be conflict between the two. There should not normally be. Section (3) makes clear that, for the purpose of interpretation and construction of the two pieces of legislation, this part of the Bill should be construed as if it were contained in part III of the 1960 Act, that is, as if we were putting this part of the Bill into the existing part III of the 1960 Act.<br><br>
The part in brackets does not affect that point. I shall take advice, but it seems to me that it is simply making it clear that we should produce an unreadable combination if we also included, for that purpose, the parts of the Bill not concerned with the 1960 Act and which seek to amend other pieces of legislation. That is the combined effect these two sections.<br><br>
The important part of subsection (3) with which the amendment is concerned, is the reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"section 35 of this Act."</p></blockquote>
Section 35 is the definition section. It defines a large number of technical terms, most important perhaps public service vehicles for the purpose of the licensing code. It makes clear that section 35 of the Bill—that is our new interpretation of most of the important words of the art in this field—will apply to part I of the Bill and to part III of the 1960 Act. In that way, by having the same interpretation clause—that is section 35 of the Bill—we make sure that there are no inconsisten-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
cies between the two measures. For purposes of the interpretation of the terms of both measures one looks to the interpretation clause in the 1979 Bill.<br><br>
I hope that makes it clear, and I hope that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) will see the relevance of this section, and will see it as an essential aid to the construction of the law, when we pass the Bill. One needs to make sure that part I of the new Bill is construed as if it were part of part III of the 1960 Act. I trust therefore that he will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will not withdraw my amendment on the basis of that explanation. All that the Parliamentary Secretary has made clear up to now is that it is his intention, by including subsection (3), that the interpretation of part III of the 1960 Act will be governed by this piece of legislation which we are now debating. If that were all it were necessary to do, subsection (3) could easily say so, but it is not all that is stated here, and the Minister has not dealt with the part in brackets.<br><br>
If we are saying that:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Part and the 1960 Act shall be construed and have effect (except so far as it textually amends any enactment) were contained."</p></blockquote>
and then excepting matters which textually amends any enactment, we are excepting any enactment which this amends. This must clearly amend the 1960 Act as well as others. If the Government wish to take a manuscript amendment, and you would agree to that, Mr. English, we may be able to clear this point out of the way, but unless it is cleared out of the way, it must be the case that what we are excepting must be every enactment which is amended by this part of the Bill, and relating that to what is contained in part III of the 1960 Act. Perhaps it would help the Committee if the Minister would explain why he cannot achieve his purpose in the more conventional way of dealing with conflicts between new legislation and existing legislation. The conventional way, as every member of the Committee well knows, is to repeal any parts of old enactments which would conflict with the new enactment and, where necessary, to put other pieces in their place or to enact alternative provisions in the new legislation. That is clearly what is being done by parts of this Bill. When one looks at the list of repeals at the back it is fairly clear
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
that that is being done. If the Minister is saying that he is merely taking the first step along the lines of consolidation and giving some guidance to those who one day either in this House or in another place will be looking at how to consolidate transport legislation and suggesting that they can consolidate the 1960 Act by incorporating a part of this Bill before they go on to general consolidation of transport, this may be a way to do it, but it is not apparent from the way in which this is drafted.<br><br>
To come to the interpretation point, is the Minister saying that if this is passed by the House, one shall look for interpretation of part III of the 1960 Act to the interpretation provisions of this measure? If that is the case, we put to him that it should not be necessary to have such guidance in clause 1 of the Bill. It should be apparent from the amendment of the repeal of the interpretation provisions of the 1960 Act that they can only be interpreted in that way. If it is the case that we are dependent on clause 1(3) for ensuring that the interpretation of part III of the 1960 Act is correct and in accordance with the Government's intentions, there must be some weakness in the Bill. I would have thought that when one looks into the repeal provisions of the 1960 Act, it is very clear, if one turns to page 68 of the Bill, that the Road Traffic Act 1960 repeals are clearly set out there. Would the Minister care to indicate to the Committee whether there is any omission there of parts which deal with the interpretation of part III? My understanding of it is that there is not. So far as the interpretation of the provisions of the 1960 Act are concerned, they are covered by both the repeal provisions of this Bill and the interpretation provisions. I shall still find great difficulty in debating this until the Minister has explained to us the meaning of this part which is in brackets and why he can apparently read it to omit the 1960 Act. Why is it, in other words, that:
<br><blockquote><p>"(except so far as it, textually amends any enactment)."</p></blockquote>
cannot be read, as I first read it, to mean any enactment inclusive of the 1960 Act? If that is so, where is the sense in this part of the provision?</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
Member for Barrow-in-Furness seems to have debated this very adequately. It is a very narrow point.<br><br>
First, on the part in brackets, all textual amendments, including amendments to the 1960 Act itself, necessarily have to be part of this Bill. It would be a nonsense to regard amended legislation, some of which may even be subsequent legislation to 1960, as though it were part of the 1960 Act. That is all the exclusion in brackets provides. If one looks to amendments for repeals, one has to look at this Bill, and clearly they have to be regarded as part of this Bill. It is for ease of interpretation, so far as everything other than amendments is concerned, that part I of the Bill is to be construed as though it were part of part III of the 1960 Act. In a way it facilitates consolidation, as the right hon. Gentleman said; it is a perfectly adequate substitute for consolidation, which is a much overrated activity in this House, because can make the existing legislation and the new legislation live together quite harmoniously by following the course that is set out in subsection (1)(<i>c</i>).<br><br>
The interpretation point is the important one. It is also quite right to say, as far as I can see from a quick glance, that the interpretation clauses of the 1960 Act, such as section 117, if they dare set out the meaning of "public service vehicle" in 1960, are repealed. They are in our list of repeals. I hope hon. Members will agree that it would not be meet to repeal the interpretation clauses in the 1960 Act without making it clear how one is to interpret the remaining parts of the 1960 Act which are not to be repealed. For the avoidance of doubt, given that one needs an interpretation clause, it is made clear that the interpretation clause in future for the purposes of the 1960 Act and for our new Bill will be clause 35.<br><br>
We certainly repeal in the schedule of repeals the interpretation of "public service vehicle" previously applied in 1960 and make it clear that for the purposes of the 1960 Act and the new Bill that clause 2, as far as public service vehicles are concerned, will in fact be the interpretation clause. The result is to put two pieces of legislation together to avoid cumbersome and unnecessary detail in the present Bill, and, I would have thought, in rather a neat way, to get over the problem of having to go for a huge amount of consolidation to make two pieces of legislation live together.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not consolidation is an overrated pastime, it is something about which we could argue for a very long time. Certainly Members of this House who search diligently at various times, other than when they are in the House, for up-to-date copies of public Acts, I do not think would share the Minister's point of view. We are among very few privileged people in this country in that we can go to the House of Commons Library which always can provide us with a marked up, annotated copy of a public Act so that we can be sure that when we read an annotated piece of legislation, we are reading what the law of this country is.<br><br>
I have always found, when I have been outside this House, that it has been very difficult indeed to be certain that one is doing that. To the extent that this substitutes in part for a consolidation, I think we can accept that it has a fairly serious purpose. One can see the point of view that it is rather neat to put into this Bill a provision which will make the interpretation of part of this legislation coincide with the interpretation of part III of the 1960 Act. That being so, it seems to me that the way of achieving it in this Bill is anything but neat. It is a most incredibly clumsy way of doing it, because we are told now that the part in brackets— "(except so far as it textually amends any enactment)"—really means that we are talking only about those parts of the 1960 Act or those parts of any other legislation which are not amended by the Bill. This is what the Minister says is the meaning. Therefore, what we are looking at really is a subsection of a clause whose intention is that one takes those parts of part I of the Bill which do not amend any other legislation and imports those into the 1960 Act, the advantage being that one has a common interpetation clause as between this part of the Bill and the interpretation clause of part III of the 1960 Act, and thereby one has saved—in advance of any consolidation—the need to have separate interpretation clauses.<br><br>
I wish that that had been made clear. It might have helped had the description of the first part of the Bill which the Minister has put out contained a description of part I. It did not. It started at part II, for reasons which we might now understand rather better. This way of doing it is unusual, to say the least. It will result, I suppose, when we first get annotated cop-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
ies, in our going to the 1960 Act and turning up the interpretation clause in so far as it applies to part II, referring to this Bill. I feel that the way of doing this leaves it wide open to difficulties of interpretation.<br><br>
On the second part, which is subsection (4), we are faced with another difficulty. Subsection (4) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to subsection (3), any reference to…part III of, the 1960 Act in any statutory provision not contained in this part or the 1960 Act shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as a reference to this part."</p></blockquote>
This appears to be at best a "belts and braces" provision, and at worst something which will cause considerable confusion. I do not know the Latin expression for "belt and braces", otherwise I should be able to use the correct legal terminology, but it would be understood by TGWU members in the North-East, with whom I was happy to discuss the Transport Bill over the weekend.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to give some guidance on this. If we are saying "Without prejudice to subsection (3)", presumably we are saying that anything in subsection (4) is not in any way to be construed as altering the understanding that he has now given; that is, the understanding that there will be a common interpretation clause for part of this Bill and part III of the 1960 Act. Without prejudice to that, we are told by subsection (4) that any reference to part III of the 1960 Act and any section which is not contained in this part
<br><blockquote><p>"shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as."</p></blockquote>
a reference to this part.<br><br>
Which part are we talking about? Presumably it is what will be a new part of part III of the 1960 Act which has been imported into that 1960 Act by the passing of the Bill. If that is the case, what is the necessity for that? I should have thought that was clear from the Minister's explanation of subsection (3). The Minister's explanation of subsection (3) is that if this is passed unamended in the way that he intends, the way in which we interpret this or in future interpret part III of the 1960 Act is as though those parts of this Bill which are not repeal provisions were in fact added—as though those parts of part I were in fact added to the 1960 Act.<br><br>
If I am correct in that and have paraphrased him accurately, what is the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0083">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
requirement for subsection (4)? What is it that subsection (4) does? In what way does it qualify the clear understanding we had of the meaning of subsection (3)? What is different? What difference is made? Would it still be the case that if subsection (4) was not in clause 1 one would, on passing the rest of the Bill unamended, have in the future to have regard to the 1960 Act in so far as the new, unamended provisions were concerned for its interpretation? Would it still, as I understand to be the case, have the common interpretation clause applying to both? If that is not the case, why do we require clause 1(4)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more we listen to this debate the more difficult it is to make what we consider to be substantial points. I take the arguments that have been passing without necessarily fully understanding the full import of the consequential changes. I can readily accept—subject to the interpretation that my hon. Friends make—that the intention of this part, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, is to make sure that the new interpretations placed on such things as public service vehicles, licensing and fitness of public service vehicles and road service licences as now intended in this piece of legislation will now be taken to mean that where they are referred to in previous legislation —particularly in reference to the 1960 Act—they will now have the meanings intended and to be decided by this Committee in the clauses of this Bill.<br><br>
It follows that a reasonable argument can be made—and indeed has been made by the Parliamentary Secretary—for this as a kind of consolidation measure in line with the true intent of this clause, and to say to people "When considering any part of this Bill, remember that the correct interpretations that are now to be placed on these important parts, such as public service vehicles, granting of licences and so on, will be as we so determine in this Bill". I think we are at least reasonably clear about that.<br><br>
Then we come up against difficulty in trying to amend, bearing in mind that that is the purpose of this clause. We thought—and expressed in earlier amendments—that this part was not as full as it should be. Hence the reason for our amendments. In some cases our amendments were accepted, as the ones we have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
just voted on; in others they were not accepted.<br><br>
On one to which I make particular reference, and on which there has already been some debate and which we strongly believe is a different interpretation of "public interest", we shall debate the detail and the definitive changes when we get to clause 5. But this particular clause on consolidation has, as a purpose, to remind those who are reading this clause that there are now different interpretations to consider with other parts of pieces of legislation in conjunction with this rule whatever decision or criterion is to be used in, for example, the providing of a road service licence.<br><br>
If there is a deficiency in what is included in the Bill, one is faced with this difficult argument again. We believe that this clause should point out to all those who are concerned about its provisions what has fundamentally changed from section 60 of the 1960 Act, and part III of the 1960 Act, which is referred to in this particular consolidation subsection. It is interesting to note that in the part III to which they refer, there have been repeals of sections which are embodied in the repeal section of the Bill before us.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Again the one section which was referred to before, an important section, which is to be repealed is the matter of section 135 which governs the conditions for granting a road service licence. In the granting of the road service licence what this consolidation part is reminding us is that the Road Traffic Act 1960 criteria for determining grants will no longer apply. I think that is exactly what it is saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understood the advice which the Minister has given us, the part in brackets in the second and third lines of clause 1(3),
<br><blockquote><p>"(except so far as it textually amends any enactment)."</p></blockquote>
must cover the amendments to the 1960 Act as well as any other amendments. Therefore it must cover all the appeal provisions. What we are talking about in subsection (3) is parts of the Bill other than those which amend other legislation and those which repeal other legislation. Therefore it would be arguable at least, given that the Minister's interpretation is a correct one—and we might have to go
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
a bit deeper into this—that all we shall be dealing with on subsection (4) are those parts of this Bill which are adding—if I can put it that way—to part III, which are not amending part III and are not repealing part III of the 1960 Act; and for that matter are not repealing any other relevant enactment.<br><br>
How far one has to go to trace this through and what part III of the 1960 Act may have done to other enactments or to bring about other repeals is hard to think; but I put it to my hon. Friend that, if he pursues the line he is pursuing, he will have to elicit from the Minister whether in fact the scope of this goes any wider than anything which is unamended or unrepealed as a result of part I of this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that interpretation. I should certainly be in some difficulty about challenging any interpretation with the reputation which my right hon. Friend rightly gains from the statutory Instruments Committee. May I challenge one part of his interpretation and perhaps then we might have a statement from the Minister about how he considers the argument. If the interpretation placed on this section by my right hon. Friend was true and it dealt with changes that were not in the repeal schedules—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with it as I see it—sections 117 and 118 (2) (<i>a</i>) (i) (ii) and (iii) are the sections which are being changed. Those are the definitions applying to those particular public service vehicles and the granting of licences. Those sections are added in the repeal section.<br><br>
I am somewhat confused. If they are in the repeal section, one could argue "Why the heck is it in this part?" Are the Government arguing that it is the intention to give one the idea that they will repeal, to save one going to the back page to look for the repeal? It becomes more and more confusing as we go on.<br><br>
The real point on which the Minister might intervene is whether this is to indicate to those people who want to know that substantial changes have taken place in certain interpretations of the words "public service vehicle" and others, as indicated in section 2. If it is solely a desire to indicate to people, would he perhaps
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
confirm that that is the position and not complicate it by the points made by my right hon. Friend.<br><br>
If that is the case, I go on to make my point that it does not have, as we argued on the earlier sections of the Bill, all the changes in definition.<br><br>
There are other changes which should be considered and which I should like to make. Would the Minister intervene and give us his interpretation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend persuades the Minister to get up, I should like to make it clear that I was not trying to give the Committee the benefit of my own interpretation at that stage. I was submitting to him—and I may have been playing devil's advocate in doing so—that what the Minister had put to us had a bearing on the argument he advanced, and in fact complicated the consideration which he was properly applying to this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are trying, in difficult circumstances, to find out exactly what the clause means. If we took the statements that the Minister made at the first sitting of the Committee, we should perhaps have been well away from this position, but would not have discovered that the clause could be amended and undoubtedly improved. We are not getting much help from his Back Benchers. One is naive enough to believe that MPs of either side are interested in the Bill and want to see that it is a proper and just measure, or, indeed, is doing what the Government thought it was doing, as we have now accepted in amendment No. 10.<br><br>
I shall assume, for the purposes of this point, in order not to delay the Committee further, that this clause intends to point out that interpretations have now changed. "Please do not take the interpretations embodied in the 1960 Act. Please refer to the new Bill, albeit the Committee agree that the clauses to follow will be as clause 1 intends them to be." If that is the case, I accept that it is a valid argument and that it embraces all except in one very important respect. We could have amended that, and we tried to do so, but the amendment was not selected. I accept that that was the view taken by the Chair.<br><br>
Therefore we are moving the deletion, as we are almost bound to do. The only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
course now open to us is to move the deletion of something which we feel does not adequately describe what the Bill is doing in regard to interpretation. If it is in regard to interpretation, our point is that it does not, in the areas repeal, particularly in section 135, define and redefine public interest. That meets all the requirements; namely, it repeals something, in that it redefines public interest. I did not read it out, but there is one passage particularly which highlights it more than the others, a detailed provision of section 135 which we are repealing. One sentence, in clause 2(<i>d</i>), on the criteria of granting licence, specifies taking into account:
<br><blockquote><p>"the elimination of unnecessary services."</p></blockquote>
That is a debate to which we shall probably come on clause 5, on what is meant by "unnecessary services".<br><br>
I want only to make the point that it is a substantially different interpretation as embodied in clause 5. The Minister is right to say that we shall debate those differences when we reach clause 5, but clause 1 seeks to illustrate to those concerned that there is a definitive difference of interpretation in these two pieces of legislation. It is our argument that that definitive difference is substantial enough to have been included here, to refer to the commissioners, to refer to the courts, to refer to lawyers or advisers the fact that public interest no longer means the same, and that is why it is repealed in the 1960 Act, as is the definition of public service vehicle and the criteria for granting licence.<br><br>
Those seem to be all the criteria the Government have given as the reason why there has been this consolidation. It would have been better, if we had been able to have our amendment selected, to debate that argument and then we should have seen whether we had a valid point. That is out of our hands, and therefore we are left solely with saying that the clause should be deleted because it does not carry out its intention, as put by the Government, namely to give proper and adequate notice to all those who are wishing to see the difference between 1960 and the Bill in the interpretation of public interest. The Minister could at least intervene and give us some idea as to whether he accepts the difference.<br><br>
If we get to clause 5, this is one of our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
difficulties, and if the Government say, "Yes, there is a difference; we want the breath of air of competition, the idea of public interest on monopoly situations is not the same": if they concede that argument, and there is a difference between us on it, how do we go back to clause 1, where we are in the same difficulty, in order to amend it to make clear that there is a difference of interpretation?<br><br>
That is one of the difficulties we are faced with here, and it would be helpful if the Ministers could give some indication, in the clear thinking that they have told us this morning they have, about the intent of the Bill. It is remarkable that with all their clear thinking they cannot accept the simple proposition that there is a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate we have had now for three whole sittings, apart from the original discussion about when we were going to meet, has revealed all sorts of curiosities and inadequacies in clause 1. I can only conclude that the Parliamentary Secretary has been spending his time instead of reading the Bill either watching some ice skating or some gymnastics on television, because, besides claiming technical merit for his Bill, he actually claimed that he ought to get some points for artistic impression because subsection (3) was a neat way of doing what he is setting out to do. It is quite clear that neatness is the last thing he can claim marks for; it is a shambles like all the rest of clause 1.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) pointed out, the alleged objective of the clause as a whole has been to clarify. It has certainly not clarified things for the Committee but it is intended that it should clarify things as far as the courts are concerned.<br><br>
I know that Parliamentary Committees get confused and unclear, but they never get quite as unclear and confused as the courts do, and I think we can assume that the product of clause 1 as a whole will be to confuse; it has certainly confused the Committee.<br><br>
Clause 1(1) was intended to draw out those major parts of the rest of part I, and subsection (3) is setting out what apparently the Government, or the Parliamentary draftsmen—if we can make the distinction—think to be sufficiently significant to be put into clause 1 subsection (3) is necessary to clause 1, so we are told, if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
clause 1 is to do its job. But it seems to me that if it was sufficiently significant to justify its inclusion as subsection (3), there was every reason to say, and to spell out probably as clause 1 (1)(<i>a</i>), that the definition of public interest was to be changed out of sight. It is clear, from the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East, that the definition of public interest is to be changed beyond all recognition. In those circumstances, if the purpose of this clause as a whole is to clarify and draw out and indicate to the courts the most important aspects of the Bill, it is failing to do so.<br><br>
The next point I make—and again it comes back to our belief that it would have been better to have dealt with clause 1 at the end of part I of the Bill—is that it is usual for interpretation clauses, as I understand it from my very limited knowledge of the law, to come at the end of that which they set out to interpret. What we have got, in effect, in subsection (3)—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why clause 35 is the last clause in part I, which one day we will debate and which does actually cover the points that the hon. Gentleman is now talking about. It is the last clause in this part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not just clause 35. The effect of subsection (3), as I understand it, is basically an interpretative matter. It is a thing which would have been better included at the end of part I because it does not fall at all into the same clarifying preliminary category that we have been talking about and which has been put forward as the justification for clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a rather startling reply from the Parliamentary Secretary. It really means, if his argument was correct and we accept that there is some substance in the argument that there are changes in the definition of public interest, and we were to put it into clause 35, which is a clause about interpretation, we would then have the debate before clause 1 was determined and we would then decide once and for all whether it could have gone into clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East. It is not simply clause 35, if I might say so, it is clause 34
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
as well. It is another of those clarifying, interpretative points which, generally speaking, come either at the end of an Act as a whole or at the end of particular parts of an Act. Therefore, it seems to me that it is absolutely appropriate to clarify the law and make things clearer for the courts, make matters easier to interpret by the people who have to operate the new law. There has been far too much emphasis on clarifying things for the courts. The people we should be clarifying the matter for are those who have to interpret the law in their day-to-day business, be they bus operators or London Transport or the traffic commissioners, in an effort to keep matters away from the courts, because the last thing we ought to be looking to in any legislation we produce is what is going to happen in the courts. We should be aiming to stop things short of getting to the courts.<br><br>
Therefore, it would be altogether better if the Committee—including, I hope, in this case, the Back Bench Members opposite, even those who managed to creep in after the doors should have been locked on the previous Division—were to see the sense of my right hon. Friend's amendment. It is clearly intended to improve this piece of legislation.<br><br>
We accept that in a sense the definitions which are to come in clause 5 will replace definitions in existing legislation, but we think it will be to the detriment of the public interest by redefining it in a worse way. However, all those things are material parts of clauses which we will consider later. What we have before us now is clause 1(3), which really is not going to change the law in any way, but just complicates things. I believe that the Back Bench Members opposite might now and again assert themselves and do something in the interests of bus operators and passengers rather than in the interests of the courts, and vote with us on this occasion, if they can get in when the Division is called and before the doors are locked. They should join us in supporting the deletion of subsection (3) because, quite frankly, it just makes an even bigger mess of clause 1 and, consequently, the rest of the Bill than what we have discussed up until now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must start from the point of a clause that did not appear to be worthwhile debating, clause 1, because it set out the purposes of the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
It seems to me that we are virtually in the process of having three Committee sittings talking about a clause that just sets out the purposes of the Bill and should not need debating. If the point had been made about clause 1 being debated, it has been made on three occasions.<br><br>
At the second sitting of the Committee, the Parliamentary Secretary made a statement, which I warmly applauded, and I am sure hon. Members opposite applauded as well. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that clause 1(1) will be of assistance to the courts when interpreting the Bill if any difficulties arise over the interpretation of later clauses. In considering how to interpret legislation before them, courts pay regard to the context of an Act itself…"</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 13 December 1979; c. 89.]</p></blockquote>
I warmly applauded that and, of course, then at our third sitting—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should be "content", not "context".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry about the error. That is the second one that the Parliamentary Secretary has been unlucky enough to encounter today. I hope these errors will be put right so that we do not fall into this difficulty again. But that minor error does not make any difference to the point I want to make, because after long and tedious discussions of a clause that did not need discussing we arrive at clause 3. Sometimes in Committees we look inwardly. We look at how Bills are to be interpreted, but I do not think we bear sufficiently in mind that when this Bill becomes an Act, people outside have to look at it. What will they find? Words like "this shall be construed". Construed by whom? What for? In what manner? This is supposed to be a clause to clarify, yet it has to be construed. So far in the debate this morning we have had about six or seven different interpretations. This is a clause to clarify. The subsection amends "any" enactment. How many? Which ones? Is the Minister in a position to say? "Any" is a very wide word. Does "any" enactment mean 100, 300, 3,000, everything touched by this Bill in any shape of form? Are there any transport provisions in the Education Bill? Is this one of the enactments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is fairly clear
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
that it refers to any enactment that contains a reference to the 1960 Act—all enactments, if one wishes. Wherever a reference is discovered to part III of the 1960 Act, that reference should be taken to include this Bill as well. There are not many of them. I will give examples. The Passenger Vehicles (Experimental Areas) Act 1977 and the Minibus Act 1977 contain references to part III of the 1960 Act. In future, when anyone comes across a reference in the Minibus Act 1977 to part III of the 1960 Act that shall also be taken to mean a reference to part I of this Bill. The result will be that there will be common interpretation and one body of law which will be contained in two provisions, the 1960 Act and this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, the hon. Gentleman has now succeeded in confusing me. I can see the relevance of the Minister's remarks to subsection (4), but I do not see the relevance to subsection (3). We are actually discussing an amendment to subsection (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. English. We have been taken wide of the amendment, but I do not think I was primarily responsible for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could all return to subsection (3) and ignore subsection (4) or any other subsection at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here a clause that we should not debate has even confused you, Mr. English. The Under-Secretary makes some wonderful points. He said that people outside do not have regard to any discussions that have taken place in Parliament, either in this Committee or on the Floor of the House. If people do not read our discussions in the House—that is what the Minister said and I think he is fundamentally correct—is that not a case that we are very clear of what we put.<br><br>
If an eminent hon. Member like you, Mr. English, who has boundless experience of this place and the constitution can, by some conceivable mishap, become confused by what the Parliamentary Secretary says, what hope is there for people outside who do not have your vast experience of this place. The clause in the Parliamentary Secretary's words, is to help to clarify, and yet in this small room,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
among this small number of people, more confusion is being poured upon confusion.<br><br>
Clause 1 seemed minor when we started our discussions, but a little bit of probing has thrown a tremendous amount of light on it. Let us hope that the remainder of the clauses are much better than this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary usually crystallises issues and clarifies matters, but his intervention in my hon. Friend's speech has caused me even more confusion.<br><br>
He referred to the relationship, of the Minibus Act 1977 to this Bill and the 1960 Act. I have not now, following his intervention, the faintest idea what effect subsection (3) has on the Minibus Act 1977, or on any interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I assist? I think the simple explanation as to why the hon. Member does not see why subsection (3) has any effect on the Minibus Act is that it does not, and subsection (4) does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept your ruling, Mr. English, and to get back to allowing my hon. Friend to continue his cogent remarks, but that was what I thought until the Parliamentary Secretary spoke. I really am not sure that that is what the Parliamentary Secretary spoke. I really am not sure that that is what the Parliamentary Secretary thinks any more because it seemed to me that certain of the definitions, say, of the number of people who can be carried in a vehicle under the terms of the Minibus Act 1977 might actually be changed as a result of this allegedly preliminary, explanatory, non-law changing clause. It seems to me to cause even greater confusion and I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
think that my hon. Friend will be able to explain to me what the answer is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I could explain the matter to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can give to Labour Members is information. I am afraid it is beyond my ability to give them understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing also with people outside. If the Parliamentary Secretary with all his vast experience and wisdom cannot impart understanding to the few hon. Members on the Opposition Benches, how can he hope to impart understanding to the people outside?<br><br>
There would be a solution to this. When my hon. Friend rose and spoke at length on the Minibus Act you, Mr. English, rose and gave a definition and interpretation. If it were possible to parcel Mr. English up and send him out with the Bill there would be no necessity for the debate on being pursued by the Opposition. But since that is a physical impossibility, the point of subsection (3) goes out the window.<br><br>
With subsection (3) we go on and look at amendments Nos. 34 and 35. If Government Members want to be more confused than subsection (3) let them try reading amendments Nos. 34 and 35 and then go back to subsection (3).</span></p>
