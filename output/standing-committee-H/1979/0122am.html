	<div class='page-header'><h1>TRANSPORT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Transport Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Committee will agree on the importance of a thorough debate on this important Bill which makes fundamental changes to our transport regulations and law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to discuss, and the Opposition have already shown a desire to explore the Bill in depth and express their views in full. But I should point out that in six sittings and 15 hours, not counting today, we have progressed half way down page 3. The Bill contains 77 pages and I, for one, do not intend to spend the next three-and-a-half years in this Committee. It would not be unduly contentious to say that so far we have made disappointing progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott: </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a disappointing Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee will wish to ensure that our deliberations do not unreasonably restrict consideration of the Bill in the House or in another place. There must be no pretext for saying that the Bill was not properly considered. I hope, therefore, that in the interests of the Committee the sittings motion will be agreed. That will allow good progress to be made and at the same time give all hon. Members the opportunity for thorough discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The length of sittings must depend on how much time members of the Committee wish to devote to the debate, but I expect that the usual channels will be open, and we shall be pleased to consider an arrangement to suit the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now necessary to make progress on this important Bill and, with the considerations I have outlined in mind, I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you will appreciate, Mr. English, the Opposition have no wish to spend time on issues other than those which enable us to make progress and equally have no desire to sit here for three-and-a-half years. But a number of the grounds on which the Minister sought to justify the sittings motion cannot go unchallenged. He takes no account of the unreasonable delay caused on clause 1 by his attitude and unwillingness to discuss any reasonable method by which a proper debate of that clause could have been facilitated. It was not until we were well into a difficult procedural discussion that his junior Minister conceded that one of the amendments tabled was perfectly right and proper. I can see no reason why the Minister should not have taken that attitude from the outset and thus facilitated debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that he wants a thorough debate. That is a bit steep coming from him. It has been this side of the Committee which has been pursuing the need for thorough debate, and the Minister and his hon. Friends have been putting every possible obstacle in the way of that. In all my years in the House I can think of no other Minister who has been so reluctant to provide the wherewithal for a thorough debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had to press him repeatedly for appropriate information. The number of occasions when my hon. Friends and I have sought information which has not been forthcoming in ministerial replies and when we have had to press the issue again is on record. We have had to ask for notes on clauses, yet a number of us still do not have such notes beyond schedule 1, although I understand that two of my hon. Friends have them. However, they were not forthcoming until a further approach was made, after the junior Minister had indicated that a sittings motion was proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether, before he goes further down this path, the right hon. Gentleman will allow me to intervene. My understanding is, and certainly my instructions were, that all the notes to clauses up to clause 35 should be made available. I also understand that the right hon. Gentleman's office was informed of that last Friday. The information is available and we have not remotely gone past the point where notes to clauses apply. Therefore, I urge the right hon. Gentle-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>291</span>
man not to overstate his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being very careful not to overstate my case. I should be interested to know when the Minister issued the instruction that the notes on clauses should be provided. Clearly, it is within the recollection of the Parliamentary Secretary that I raised the matter with him after his announcement of the intention to move this sittings motion. So the decision to put that motion was made known to us before the Minister decided to issue the notes on clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the facts, it is not I am not overstating the case. The Minister knows that I have been meticulous in reminding him on a number of occasions of the need to inform me when matters were being decided by the Government which affected the Opposition. I am normally available in my office on Friday. I left for a meeting in Lancaster at just after 3 o'clock last Friday afternoon, but up to that time I had not been informed of the availability of the notes. The timing is not crucial to my argument in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point remains—and the Minister should acknowledge it—that he had decided on the sittings motion before any notes on clause 3 and schedule 1 were issued to any members of the Opposition. The fact that some, including myself, still do not have them, may be due to an error in the Minister's Department, which I accept. However, that is an unhappy error, following the other difficulties that we have faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We strongly agree that there should be a thorough debate and we would be assisted if the usual channels were kept open for discussion. The Opposition Whip has approached the Government Whip to glean, if possible, any information about what the Government consider to be reasonable progress on the Bill. However, precious little has been forthcoming in the way of help or information. Even now, the Minister has not given a clear idea of what he considers a reasonable timetable. He insults the intelligence of experienced members of the Committee with his calculation of three-and-a-half hours—I mean, of course, three-and-a-half years. Three-and-a-half hours would be an insult, too, but that was a slip of the tongue on my part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
Chairman would be glad if it were three and a half hours instead of three and a half years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such is your regard, Mr. English, for conducting proper proceedings and carrying out our duty as members of a Standing Committee, that at least you will accept that on every Bill more importance is attached to certain clauses than to others. Certain clauses are more controversial than others, and we have reached an extremely controversial stage here. No one seriously imagines that the same amount of time will be required on each clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our progress has been disappointing to the Minister, it has been equally disappointing to us and to people outside who, it appears, have not been consulted on important issues relating to the Bill. When we debated at our last sitting an amendment to restrict to five the number of seats permitted in a vehicle used for car sharing, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that in his view that would be an unreasonable restriction. No indication was given us that the Association of Metropolitan Authorities—a not disinterested body—took a similar view to that contained in our amendment. I learnt that later that day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Government Members of the Committee not only fail to reflect their own judgment on the Bill, as has happened up till now, but also the judgment of other elected Conservative representatives in the country, including those on the AMA, clearly it will be difficult to make progress. If we in the Opposition are expected to put not only Labour views but those of interested bodies of Conservative persuasion, we shall clearly have a long and difficult Committee stage. But I hope that Government Members, in addressing themselves to this sittings motion, will appreciate that they have a role to play, and that they would not be serving the interests of progress if they were given to instant conversion to every amendment tabled by the Minister. If they agreed with the Bill, as it appeared on Second Reading, they should give some explanation of why they agree with it as now amended by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to make progress both with the Bill and the sittings motion. But given the very special circumstances that exist, the Minister should provide at least some indication of what he would consider to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
be reasonable progress at this stage. That would be for the convenience not only of members of the Committee, but for the staff of the House. Some regard should be had to the staff who, on the basis on this motion, will not know at what time they can go home at night. The Tuesday and Thursday afternoon sittings specified in the motion are open-ended. We expect a reasonable indication from the Minister as to when he intends to rise after the afternoon sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, sittings motions of this type deny members of the Committee their very special right and duty to attend the Chamber on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, when many important issues will no doubt be debated in which we shall be interested. The least than can be offered to us, therefore, is an indication from the Minister of what he regards as reasonable progress and what information will be forthcoming in order to facilitate that progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are continually faced with the possibility —certainly on lengthy Bills—of afternoon sittings. This is a lengthy Bill, and we naturally welcome all opportunities provided for a proper debate. That has been the whole basis of our case. Some of the Minister's remarks have led, naturally enough, to the proper reaction by my right hon. Friend. Certainly, we have been in favour of a thorough debate. Indeed, during our last sitting we voted against the adjournment of the Committee, although I admit that only 10 minutes of that sitting remained. I do not want to make a major point here because the generosity of the Minister in seeking to adjourn may well be called upon again to our advantage. Nevertheless, it is ironic that the last action of the Labour members of the Committee should have been to fight for every minute of debate on the Bill, when the Court were seeking to terminate the sitting early.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of our taking three and a half years on the Bill, and I agree that on a crude calculation the Committee stage would take a considerable time. However, with afternoon sittings every member of the Committee encounters difficulty in attending other meetings in the House. Clearly we have to take that difficulty into account. However, if the Minister wants a proper debate on all these
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
clauses, I hope he will take the muzzles off his own Back Benchers. If he is calling for a debate and for a searching inquiry into what he calls a fundamental Bill I can only say that we have heard precious little from his Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed it is our inquiries that have led to major changes in the Bill. After considerable argument the Parliamentary Secretary came forward at the last sitting of the Committee and conceded that, because we had made certain points in regard to the enforcement procedures of car sharing, certain parts of the Bill would need to be changed fundamentally. So, on a number of occasions during debate we have established the value of making searching inquiries into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken the trouble of looking at the proceedings on the 1978 Bill. The Minister led for the Opposition on that occasion. I note that whilst it was a much smaller Bill the second clause was still being debated during the fifth and sixth sittings. That is the position of this Committee now. However, this Bill is about six or seven times the size of the 1978 Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that on that Bill it was the Government—Labour—Back Benchers who were doing quite a lot of the talking. The same amount of time had been taken, but we Labour Members were joining in. There was a full discussion, unlike on this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. It is a matter of record that a great deal of the speaking was done by Government Back Benchers at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have justified the kind of investigation and searching inquiry that we have conducted through our amendments to the Bill. That brings me to the time available for amendments. The Government may say that they are concerned about the time being taken or, as the Minister said, at the disappointing progress being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Amendment Paper dated Thursday 17 January. There were 32 amendments on that paper, 17 of them Government amendments. Of course a considerable amount of time could be taken on the Opposition amendments but if more amendments are put down by the Government than by the Opposition that must create extra pressure. Indeed, I think that we will be dealing with two Government amendments when we have finished with the sittings motion. Many of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
the amendments are coming from the Government, but if we had proceeded faster, as the Minister would have preferred, the important deletions he has proposed in amendments Numbers 61 and 62 would not have been possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those amendments were not on the order paper on the Tuesday preceding Thursday's debate, so there has been some pretty rapid thinking by the Government on this. Had we not conducted the kind of inquiry into the Bill that we have, they would have been denied the opportunity to have that reflection and to make those proposals to delete important provisions from the Bill. I hope, therefore, that when we reach that point, in order to save time, the Minister will give a full statement of the reasons for those proposed deletions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the meantime, I think that we have established the case for a proper debate on the Bill. We are therefore not necessarily against a sittings motion. It is inevitable with a Bill of this kind that more time is needed to conduct the kind of inquiry that we have called for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that things have taken a unfortunate turn in the Committee. Without allocating blame, which is never profitable, I think that that is to be deplored. One cause for regret is that once one has entered this kind of area any good will that one may have had is lost. That is pity, because in seeking to make constructive legislation one needs all the good will that one can get from both sides. But that is just my personal opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put a number of points for the Minister to consider. First, has he not been a little precipitate in bringing forward the sittings motion at this stage? A battering ram of this nature is normally used only when all other procedures have been exhausted. That is certainly not the case at this stage. A number of members on both sides of the Committee have more experience of Committee procedure than I. I therefore do not claim to give advice on this matter. But in my experience, what normally happens is that the usual channels confer and decide between them how far the Committee wants to get, striking a reasonable balance between the Government's business and the Opposition's right to scrutinise the legislation. I am not satisfied that this has been hammered out with any degree of effort.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
Again, I allocate no blame, as that is unprofitable. I merely suggest that this has not been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is usual for a Committee not to make very fast progress in the early stages, because it usually takes time for both sides of the Committee to settle into the mainstream of debate and to grasp the complex issues that are part and parcel of it. There is usually slow progress at the beginning. I have twice been a member of the Committee on the Finance Bill. Frankly, from the progress on the early parts of those Bills I never thought that the Government would get any money on either occasion. But, as experienced hon. Members know, as time goes on things start to pick up and more rapid progress is made. There is a lot of debate on matters of time. It may be argued that somebody is filibustering or somebody is rushing through. One has to cut it in half to see where the truth is and to strike a reasonable balance between the wishes of the Government and those of the Opposition. If one reaches a position where good will is lost one is going into a cul-de-sac.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my first point. I do not think that there has been enough exploration through the usual channels to hammer out a reasonable programme that would strike a balance between the wishes of the two sides. I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) would respond constructively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said that he did not wish to allocate blame in the matter. Although I am mindful that we are adjured,
	<br><blockquote><p>"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone",</p></blockquote>
I consider myself sufficiently sinless in this respect to lob a big stone at the Minister. Most of the delays have been entirely his fault. Had he and his colleagues chosen to accept the amendment to the sittings motion proposed by my right hon. Friend at the beginning of our first sitting, we should have begun debating clause 1 after about 10 minutes of that sitting. Instead, the entire morning was wasted on debating a sittings motion—as indeed we are now taking up a little time debating another sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
If the Minister is exasperated that we have made so little progress in six sittings, he ought to remember that he has honoured us with his presence on only three of those occasions. That was because he refused to accept my right hon. Friend's amendment to the sittings motion to the effect that we should meet on Thursday afternoons rather than Thursday mornings. The Minister could than have had the benefit of being present and we, no doubt would have benefited from his skills in piloting Bills through Committee. We should then have made greater progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My major point, however, is that most of the delays have been caused by this lousy Bill. We uselessly spent a great deal of time debating clause 1—a curious, unusual, though not unique clause. Had it not been for that we could have reached the meat of the Bill—clause 2, where the meat, or at least the crackling, starts. Had the Minister accepted my right hon. Friend's amendment to the sittings motion, and had the Bill not included the ridiculous clause 1, which contributes nothing to the legislation, we should have started debating the substance of the Bill at the first sitting. Instead we have only just begun to do that in the seventh sitting. That is entirely the responsibility of the Minister. It is therefore no good his blaming the Opposition, whose job it is to scrutinise the Bill, for doing just that. Had he done his job as well as we have done ours, we should already have been a lot further on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has already pointed out that had my colleagues not subjected some of the Bill to protracted scrutiny, the Minister would not have been able to put down amendments Numbers 61 and 62—which kick clause 2 to pieces—because we should have passed clause 2 long before. That suggests that, by the Minister's own admission, the Bill has been improved as a result of our scrutiny. There has certainly been no scrutiny from the Government side. As far as one can see, no one on the other side of the Committee apart from the Minister and the Parliament Secretary had even noticed that anything was wrong with clause 2. Certainly none of them have drawn attention to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter arising in my mind is that, if as a result of the careful scrutiny
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
being given the Minister has to concede major changes because there are nonsenses in the Bill as drafted, I am suspicious of some of the more innocent-looking clauses later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has occurred to me that the first five clauses of the Bill were the most complicated and difficult to understand, and consequently would demand the most careful scrutiny. But if by this sittings motion the Minister is now saying that we must sit all the hours God sends to get his Bill through because it is all terribly difficult, he is attempting to railroad us into submission and into not looking carefully at some of the later clauses. I am a suspicion person, which is what we are paid to be when in Opposition. I might be arrested if I am not careful. Being a suspected person, I am not now loitering with intent but I certainly shall loiter with intent as I gaze at the later clauses. My intention will be to try to find out, to point out, and to seek to change gross errors that have crept into the Bill as a result of the shabby drafting that we have seen so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If clause 1 has sustained changes and clause 2 has lost a big chunk of its body politic, there is every reason to suspect that there are just as many nonsenses in later clauses. Indeed, the abundance of amendments tabled by the Minister suggests that that is so. So I hope he does not think he will make us fret at the thought of losing our evening meal and so on. I am a new Member, but I think that the old lags on this side are likely to respond by saying that we have a job to do and that if, because of his incompetence and that of his advisers, he is taking too much time getting his Bill through and is getting into trouble with his Whips, that is his problem. We will be doing our job by looking carefully at the Bill, no matter how long it takes, because there are important matters contained therein and there is every reason to believe, on the track record of clauses 1 and 2, that there is still much that is wrong with it, and we shall have to put it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not quite sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) was loitering with or without intent, but, whichever it was, he did it very successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sad day that we have reached this stage in the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
put his finger on the pulse of the matter when he said that when we come to a motion of this nature a large amount of good will goes out of the window. That is a great pity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the position—and the Minister will be aware of this—during the 1978 Bill the normal channels were utilised and progress was made. I, and I am sure other hon. Members, are not aware of the rate of progress the Minister wishes to achieve. Nothing has come through usual channels, as far as I know. Clearly the initial clauses usually take much longer than later ones. Naturally there is repetition, therefore it would be normal at this stage of our proceedings to be taking extra time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have sympathised with the Minister had this motion been put down eight or nine weeks hence. He might then have had a case for it. But we do not know the rate of progress he wishes. Perhaps he could tell us, because it has not become obvious through the normal channels. I should have thought that at least those channels would have been utilised and been tried first to give us an indication of the kind of progress required. That happened in 1978 quite successfully. I recall that on occasions we wanted a rate of progress oh a certain clause. The Opposition did not agree, and it took longer to complete discussion on the clause. However, subsequently one of the later clauses did not take quite so long as we had anticipated. That sort of co-operation without ending or short-circuiting discussion was vital. Had we not been able to debate clause 1, as the Minister seemed to believe, we should have passed the stage when the Minister could have tabled his amendments. What would the position then have been?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that there has been delay. If the Government maintain that there has, a large measure of the blame for that must be laid upon their Front Bench. Our long debate on whether or not we could debate took up most of one sitting. If the Government had accepted that we could debate the clause that time would not have been wasted. Hon. Gentlemen now have the audacity to tell my hon. Friends that we wasted that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

lute nonsense. Of course we have not wasted time. We struggled on manfully to buy the Minister the time that was vitally necessary for him to have another look at the Bill in order to table those amendments about which I am sure some of his hon. Friends spoke to him. When I entered the Committee this morning there were little cards in front of each of us on this side of the Committee congratulating us for buying the Minister the time that was so vital for him to look again at the Bill and table Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62 which I hope we shall debate in the near future. Those amendments will now udoubtedly be made famous, because our debating clause 1 bought time for the Government to reflect on the issue. But now the Government have the audacity to accuse we who have been so helpful of wanting to delay the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from me to seek to cause delay, but it seems that in the early stages of any Bill—and I have examined many Bills in a number of committees—matters seem to progress slowly. However, as the Bill continues one finds that progress speeds up. Before the Minister presses this motion I hope that he will say that all normal channels have been tried and exhausted and that he will indicate, if there has been delay, where that delay occurred and what progress he wishes to make. These matters could have been ironed out through the normal channels long before afternoon sittings became necessary, a development which can lead only to a loss of good will. It is a pity that the Committee has arrived at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly appreciate the concern of the Opposition, but I believe it right to remind the Committee since a distinction has been made between the 1978 Act and the Bill by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) among others—that we debated the sittings motion for almost two and a half hours during our first sitting and at our second sitting talked about the order of clauses. We therefore spent most of the first two sittings on those matters. If the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pan-eras, South (Mr. Dobson) honestly believes that my predecessor as Secretary of State of Transport, the right hon. Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers), would at that stage have accepted the sort of proposition being put by the Opposition, he is

being extraordinarily naive. I am sure that not for one moment does the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) believe that his former master would have done such a thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to the 1978 Bill, and to the progress made in Committee then. Although we took several hours on the sittings motion and on the orders of clauses on this Bill, on the 1978 Bill we took about five minutes agreeing with the then Secretary of State of transport that we should make progress. That is the difference in approach between the Conservative Opposition on the first day, as reported on the first page of 	<i>Hansard,</i> dealing with the substance of the Bill. That has not been the case in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) made a point about the notes to clauses. Let me remind the right hon. Gentleman that provision of the notes is not a right but a concession given by Governments. It was because my predecessor made notes on clauses available in 1978 that I thought—among other things, because there is a co-interest in transport—that notes on clauses should be made available on this Bill. My information—I had this checked—is that the notes on clauses up to clause 35 left my office at about 1.30 p.m. on Friday. I believe that many hon. Members in this Committee, indeed everyone apart, apparently, from the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), has now received them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I gave instructions personally that the right hon. Gentleman should be told that the notes on clauses were coming. I am advised that my office informed the right hon.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Transport Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
	<p>is overstating the case. I believe that his hon. Friend the member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) appears to have all the notes on clauses with him. There may have been a mistake but I suggest that it was not a mistake made in my office.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East perfectly fairly said that he did not want to oppose the sittings motion. I should like to see as much co-operation between both sides of the Committee as is possible. I recognise that there are differences between our approaches. The differences appear to have widened considerably since the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness has been leading for the Opposition on transport. The right hon. Member is going into new policy ground which differs not only from myself but from my predecessor in the Labour Administration. That is one of the problems we face. The nearness—I shall not say consensus—that we approached in some areas has been reversed, and in many ways I believe the responsibility for that lies with the right hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p>Having accepted that there are differences between the two sides of this Committee—even wider differences than previously—I certainly want there to be as much co-operation as possible. The usual channels are open to talk about this. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that during the course of the day we have personal talks, perhaps when my hon. Friend is dealing with one of the amendments, on the progress that can be made.</p>
	<p>With that in mind, and the assurance that I would like nothing more than to talk to the right hon. Gentleman, I ask the Committee to accept the sittings motion.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that apart from the statement given by the Parliament Secretary, we have had no official indication in the form of a note of what brought about such a major rethinking by the Government. I hear hon. Members say that we have the amendments. But although clauses can be read well before the Committee's discussions, the difficulty arises when amendments of such substance are put down only a day or two before they are to be debated. It is hard for the Opposition to understand their full implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
We began to draw some of those implications from the Parliamentary Secretary, which may well have been a reason for moving the adjournment in our previous sitting. Although we have not received notes on this clause, we have the advantage, since today is Tuesday, of having the Minister here. It was said, I believe in our previous sitting, that this part of the Bill should be known as the "Fowler clause", as the matter of car sharing is very much the Minister's own concern. Other people have nibbled at the edges, but he has always made it an essential part of transport policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To do the Minister justice, he has said that for a considerable length of time. In the 1978 Transport Act, the right hon. Gentleman considered the Labour Government's approach to the problem as being rather limited. To refresh our memories, amendments Nos 61 and 62 seek to take out of the clause any powers of direction concerning car sharing. Those powers were embodied in the clause to deal with the Minister's recommendations on costs in arriving at an aggregate fare for a driver to charge passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the Parliamentary Secretary's introduction of the amendment at our last sitting, we see he made clear that the Government arrived at this position only after some reflection. I quote the Parliamentary Secretary
	<br><blockquote><p>"amendment No. 61 shows that upon consideration by the Government, forced in part by what was represented by the Opposition, we are withdrawing the direction-making power altogether."</p></blockquote>
He stated later:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall endeavour to go for a simple exercise in open government and explain how this innocent direction-making power first got into the Bill and how it was decided by the Government, upon reflection, that it is not worth bothering about."</p></blockquote>
The Minister was telling us that the direction-making powers on cost-sharing would no longer apply. What is the implication of his remarks? Is the argument that if one charges more than those costs which are to be laid down—in whatever form that is directed—an offence would be committed?
The Opposition therefore put down a number of amendments to deal with such offences that may occur—whether there should be an endorsement on the licence, whether the directions should be by positive order of a statutory instrument and whether the cost to which the amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
ments refer in respect of enforcement should vary from one vehicle to another, depending on size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the basic points of contention between us and about which we should like to hear from the Minister concerns those amendments. My hon. Friend will deal with the matter in detail in due course. How under the new proposals will the Minister determine the true costs? Clearly, that is a subject about which there will be difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been agreed that the Minister intends to keep to his principle that a person should not profit from the exercise and charge more than what is considered fair. In addition to petrol, depreciation and general wear of the car will be taken into account. Therefore the charge will reflect more than just the cost of petrol, which tends to be the prime consideration at present when a car is shared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give an indication not only of his thinking and the way that he has arrived at that conclusion but also whether—now that he seeks to remove the direction-making powers which would have required him to be much more definitive about the charges —it is the Government's intention that anyone should profit from the exercise. In this instance, that means that he should make more than simply the cost of petrol but that he should not make more than what is considered by the Government to be a general charge that is to be levied to cover depreciation, wear and petrol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary made clear in our last debate when he moved the amendment that the Government were not seeking to conclude that charging in such a way should be considered for business purposes. However, I note that he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That means that the capital cost of the car can be taken into account in the same way as calculating mileage allowances for business purposes".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 17 January 1980; c. 275–6.]</p></blockquote>
Presumably, "business purposes" means, in that sense, not the profit motive that is normally associated with the phrase, but purely the calculation of mileages—as happens with Ministers of Parliament —when assessing payment to a person for use of a car for a business purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it depends on the size of the car—I hasten to add that I drive a larger type of car—whether the mileage charge puts one in a position of gain or not. I see
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
certain Conservative Members nodding their heads. I do not know whether I can tempt them to make a contribution on the subject of amendment No. 61. However, the same will certainly apply to anyone intending to use his vehicle for car sharing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the Minister made clear —perhaps a little to our surprise —that the directions which he was considering, even under the unamended clause, were to be by letter, although any reference to the word "direction" is removed by the amendment. It is interesting that the Minister now feels that the directions could have been given by letter. Perhaps that makes them assume the properties of a code. But they will not be enforceable. People are expected to make honest and truthfull declarations. That may be all right in certain circumstances, but I note that that is the reverse of the approach adopted by the Conservatives in Opposition when the Labour Government were proposing the use of codes for industrial relations, particularly in regard to the freedom of the Press and the closed shop. There they argued that codes, directions, letters and TUC committees were not sufficient. They said that, in their opinion, the law should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this instance, we are changing the law and saying "You can now use your car provided you do not make a profit on it". The only difference between us now in the interpretation of the clause is whether open abuse of the procedure can be avoided, and people will not use their car for business. Under the old provisions it would have been illegal to have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always pleasing for an Opposition to hear that their arguments have been considered, that their amendments have highlighted the true implications of the clause and that the Government therefore are to remove the offending provisions. All Oppositions hope at some time to develop that kind of effective argument. But it does not cut much ice. The argument about car sharing has been advanced by the right hon. Gentleman for many years. It was in "The Right Track", the Conservative Party's policy document and the right hon. Gentleman voiced it in his opposition to Labour transport Bills. He made trips to America in 1978 and more recently to consider the implications of car sharing. One of his strongest arguments on the 1978 Bill was that the Labour Government should have implemented a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
car pool system. I do not see any such proposal in this Bill, but perhaps the Minister is thinking of introducing that later by way of an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a bit much for the Government to say suddenly that, after reflection, there has been new thinking so we should delete some provisions. Can anyone accept the Minister's argument that this is new thinking? The arguments advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary on the amendment were that they thought there would be difficulties in implementing such a code for different cars using a different rate of mileage costs. That is not new thinking. That should have been evident for the past few years, almost since cars were produced, so there is not a great deal of new thinking there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Minister discussed with his Department the new clauses that were to be put in the Bill. When he reached the clause on car sharing these difficulties were, no doubt, discussed. The balance of judgment at the time was to put in an enforcement procedure. The Government have now changed their mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason given was that one may have continually to send out more letters as inflation increases. I have every sympathy with that, but that is very much to do with the Government's policy on inflation. Whether inflation was 8 per cent. or 16 per cent. there would certainly have been a continuing problem if one wanted to update mileage. Indeed, there cannot be a great deal of new thinking on the matter because, as the Minister must know from his mileage notice from the Fees Office, the figures change every so often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His third reason was that the public would not know that the Minister had sent these letters and so would not know the figures. I am bound to say that that does not require much new thinking. That is one reason why we tabled the amendment. It is an obvious consideration but one which no doubt the Minister rejected previously after all the years of deploying arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason was that there were other forms of direction, which also means "a broad indication"—sometimes known as a nod and a wink. That is distinctly different from saying that it is illegal to make a profit out of the exercise, and that in order to protect the driver and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
passenger the Minister will lay down charges that reflect the true costs which will not be considered to contain an element of profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A broad indication provides much weaker protection for the passenger and the driver, who may well wish to keep within the Government's rule not to make a profit out of his journey but wishes to offer his car as a social gesture to reduce congestion, save energy, and to reduce the many cars on the roads, particularly in the London area. The Minister could claim success if he could reduce the number of cars travelling in the area by 10 per cent. The Minister's reasons are therefore hardly new. They must have been evident to him during recent years when he was advancing this principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On other forms of direction, the Parliamentary Secretary said at our last sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>Legislation and regulations fall into error and the draftsmanship tends to be the poorer the more one tries to go into details and to be specific to a minute extent on an approach to matters which are best described in simple language and left to the commonsense judgment of tribunals and courts to decide the facts of the case on the evidence.—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 17 January 1978, c.276.]</p></blockquote>
Many hon. Members on both sides may have sympathy with the draftsman's use of simple language. There was an article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> last week by someone in the Parliamentary draftsman's department who had some rather scathing things to say about the draftsman's approach to legislation. But be that as it may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to say that because there are difficulties in drafting these finer points there should be only a broad indication. That might well apply to a number of aspects of the Bill but so far it has not discouraged the Government from pursuing their major principle. It may be considered a major argument for not imposing the car sharing principle if one still believes—this is the cardinal point—that the intention is to prevent a profit-making exercise. If there is such an exercise, clearly all those in the private hire car and taxi business will have the right to say, as they do under present provisions, that there is a direct threat to their livelihood. If profit were involved and the driver secured more money than was the true cost of using his car, the Minister would be hard put to disprove to the private hire car and taxi industry that the living was of its members not to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
undermined by the provision to make that illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's proposals present the Committee with considerable difficulty. He takes out of the Bill direction-making powers, preferring to rely solely on a broad indication. When we deal with my hon. Friend's amendment we may get a better indication of what those costs will be. I hope that the Minister will confirm that it is his intention, as reflected in the Bill, that profit shall not be made from this part of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says that the "broad indication" is that a driver shall not charge more than £X in aggregate for a particular journey and that a profit is not to be made, presumably, as his right hon. Friend pointed, out, he is to leave the actual decision making to bodies outside Parliament. If was stated earlier that the Parliamentary Secretary had made it clear that it was now to be left to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the commonsense judgement of tribunals and courts to decide the facts of the case on the evidence."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 17 January 1980, c.276.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will help us with one difficulty that arose in our debate at the end of our last sitting. This has always been a matter of concern to Labour Members, particularly in relation to insurance. The same problem arose for the previous Labour Government when they introduced a limited form of car sharing. What would the insurance position be, particularly if a profit were made on a journey? Would the premiums increase? The more serious question concerns what would happen now if an accident occurred in which the driver had picked up three or four people and had charged them an aggregate amount that turned out to be much larger than the amount recommended by the Minister? Presumably, the driver would be making a profit. If that case were taken to the court as a claim by the passenger against the driver and it was shown that a profit had been made, would the insurance cover be sufficient to cover the passengers? Or would it be argued that they were not sufficiently covered by those insurance provisions and that there was therefore no legitimate claim against that insurance company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether that matter is decided for or against, I want to ask the Minister—and, clearly, he will need to get some briefing on the matter—whether he is quite happy,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
in encouraging people to use their cars to carry people from A to B, to leave it to the courts to decide by matter of precedent what the law shall mean, because Parliament finds it too difficult to make the definition and is therefore leaving the matter to the courts to decide. Thus, a man, who suffers grevious injury, thinks he is covered by the insurance on the vehicle, but finds that he is not. Of course, case law would have determined by then that either Parliament must make the matter clear or the insurance companies must change the provisions of their insurance to make sure that cover is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very unhappy situation in which citizens must either be maimed or killed, and the relatives affected, before the law is to be determined. Parliament is giving up its right to say what the law whould be, as of course, the law has always been interpreted by the courts. Parliament has always made reasonably clear what a particular clause or Bill means, but the courts have then said "That may be what you intended, but that is not what the law says." difficulties arise even when we in Parliamentary think the clause is pretty plain. Now we are going further. We are saying that we shall no longer attempt to define the law; we shall leave it to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, that is totally unsatisfactory. That is why, in the Labour Government's Transport Act 1978, the matter was made clear. That is why it said that a business operation will not be conducted in that matter, that if it was, it could apply only to people who carried no more than four to a car, and that special laws and regulations would apply to those involved in business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the Minister is opening up a grey area which thousands of our citizens will be encouraged to enter, of which the consequences are not clear, and for which he is ducking his responsibility. I believe that his original judgment about enforcing the law was right. If he has been persuaded by these arguments, which are not new, it is hardly a good omen for the thinking that goes on in interpreting and formulating the Bill. I hope that he will be strong now and explain his own thinking, because, frankly, the clause is very much identified with his own thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Secretary at our last sitting. Clause 2 seeks to determine conditions for licensing and to determine exceptions. If we see the clause in that context, we find that one of the important passages is contained in subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), with which subsections (4) and (5) are linked. An important exception from PSV licensing is the cost and profit principle. The Bill seeks to exempt small vehicles of a determined size from licensing if they conform to certain conditions of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our last sitting I felt sorry for the Parliamentary Secretary, whose clarity and perseverance I admire, because he was given the task of clearing out the stable while his master was away—in other words, introducing the amendments. The amendments are not chipping away at bits and pieces on the edge; they are important amendments on crucial matters. We have already debated what constitutes a business and what is commercial in the sense of subsection (3). But although the Parliamentary Secretary was congenial, I found his explanation totally unconvincing. Either he or the Minister, in winding up, should explain precisely what they are about in clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of arguments can be made against the withdrawal of the directive powers which the Minister originally sought. I am always suspicious when Governments want less power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I make no partisan point here. I merely make a political point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary gave an innocent-sounding and bland explanation of why the power was to be withdrawn. Beware of the Ministry of Transport when it looks innocent! Beware particularly, because in other areas, namely, the rate support grant, the Government are taking extra powers. Why is the trend in this legislation moving in quite the opposite direction from the trend in other social and financial legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the Tory chorus now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regulations have two purposes. One is to make things clear. I do not say that they always do that, but that is the intention. In regulations in which the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed, we all know where we are if there are disputes on points of principle or of detail where there may be differences of opinion about how the clause operates on the ground—literally on the ground in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second purpose of regulations is to invite discussion about how the relevant clause is to be interpreted. When the Minister begins to make his regulations, he will presumably invite opinions from all sorts of people, including bus operators, in the public and private sectors. Presumably, they will help him to put the regulations together so that they will be beneficial to all concerned. The Minister will be neglecting those two areas which would be of advantage to himself and to the benefit of the Act if he gives this opportunity away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the regulations have been withdrawn because it is not possible to define in detail precisely how this part of clause 2 will work. I think that the Minister is leaving it entirely to chance. We cannot do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to impute wrong motives to the Minister. I could say that if it is his intention to let the pirate operators, flying the Jolly Roger, into the rural areas and elsewhere, that will leave gaps in the clause through which they could drive a coach and four. I am not suggesting that, but it could be construed in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary also implied that he was giving way on the regulations because our arguments had moved him. That brought a smile to my face. He referred to his Second Reading speech when he said that the Opposition had kicked up a fuss about the Government introducing the regulations and taking dictatorial power. Suddenly, he saw the blinding light of our arguments and announced that he was withdrawing the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary should come off it. The Opposition can be accused of many things, but we were not born yesterday. I suspect that there is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
something else at the root of it. Let me suggest what that might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our last sitting I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a question about the non-commercial or non-business principle in respect of clause 2, (3)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). I asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the owner of a small vehicle also drives it, does the running cost include his wages or remuneration for doing that?"</p></blockquote>
That was a genuine question because I did not know. I still do not know. The Parliamentary Secretary's response was quite unusual for him. He said that he was unsure. He did not know. I think that that is commendable in any politician. Hearing a Member say that he does not know is a refreshing experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If my immediate response proves to be wrong, I shall reconsider it. However, my understanding of the matter is that such remuneration would not be included."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H, 17 January 1980; c.278</i>].</p></blockquote>
	<i>We have yet to hear from him again on this point.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I always put in those cautionary words when I give an opinion off the cuff. However, the Hon Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) will be relieved to know that I am now advised that my response was right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that intervention, because it clears up a good many matters—or does it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking at the question whether someone is in a business. I believe that some of my hon Friends were led astray by the use of the word profit a few minutes ago. Whether or not one makes a profit can be quite distinct from whether or not one is in business. I understand that large parts of British industry make no profit, yet all would admit that they are in business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is therefore that the intention to make a profit, whether one does so or not, is the important point at issue. One cannot change horses in midstream. One cannot say that because one is not making a profit one is therefore not commercial and not in business. At other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
times the situation will be different. One might well be in business and, even though one is not making a profit, still acting in a commercial way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made some of those points last time, but perhaps my hon. Friend's experience may give us more information about the definition of "hire or reward". However I recall reading somewhere that in "hire or reward" cases the courts had decided that profits may be made without a business actually being conducted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is so. One thing that frightens me about the present loose wording of this part of clause 2 is that it will lead to endless disputes in courts. It is in the nature of lawyers that if they are paid by the hour they will spin a matter out all day. In my experience, they take 20 minutes to ask for one's name and address, let alone to decide what is "profit" and what is "business"—that is, if they do not need a refresher at the end of the first question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the economic principle. Apparently, running costs are not inclusive of the costs of the driver. That is an odd definition of running costs. If one is operating on the basis of eight plus one—the driver—I should have thought that a substantial part of the runing costs would be the remuneration paid to the driver. Let us take the economics of running buses. One of the factors that militate against running a small bus for profit is the high proportion of total costs represented by the driver's wages. If, in considering the running costs of a vehicle, one excludes the question whether the driver is self-employed, an owner-driver or an employee, receiving wages from someone else, considerable difficulties arise. However, I shall await the penetrating shaft of light that no doubt will come from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary at the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the matter on the basis of the average total cost principle rather than on what is a business. What is a business? In a business one seeks to do a number of things. First, one seeks to cover the fixed costs. Secondly, one seeks to cover the variable costs. Thirdly there is is an element of profit, which is revenue above costs. That may be interpreted as the remuneration for the person who drives the bus, and that may be all that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
the business seeks to do. The Parliamentary Secretary has rightly responded, however that if we did it that way, it could be defined as a business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are still not out of the wood. We then come to the whole question of what are running costs. At first glance, I took it that running costs were the variable costs. Fixed costs are incurred whether one runs the vehicle or not. Variable costs are incurred only if one runs the vehicle. I therefore thought at the start that the remuneration for the driver was part of the variable costs. In the course of the discussion, I then understood that the fixed costs were to be averaged in the calculation as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I can say is that if no amount of money at all is included for the remuneration of the driver, whether he be employed or self-employed, that will produce an odd picture of running costs and one which will add substantial confusion to what the Minister himself wishes to do. I appreciate what he is trying to do, but I believe that we need regulations in order to save a lot of hassle in the courts or before tribunals. I appeal to the Minister to throw some light on those matters when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has spent a lot of time berating my hon.

Gentleman is not with us and so is unable to enjoy what he would apparently regard as a unique experience, namely a speech by a Conservative Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will bring him in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East is so concerned that his hon. Friend should be here that apparently he is now going to find him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both hon. Members should be aware that we on the Government side
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
take our consideration of the Bill just as seriously as they do. If we intervene it will not be because we have been provoked, but because we feel seriously about certain points. I went—as no doubt did Labour Ministers—to see my local transport undertakings to discover their views on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard quite a lot about the courts in relation to the amendment to withdraw the subsections dealing with directions from the Minister. On reflection, I believe that to be somewhat unrealistic because, invariably, car-sharing arrangements are made on an informal basis and I cannot see many, if any, cases where car-sharing arrangements will be made an issue at law. Therefore, I am somewhat concerned about the concept that we should leave the rights and wrongs of car sharing to the courts and I believe that we should look at what might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Government's reasons for wanting to withdraw the subsections. Doing so would appear to be in the interests of simplication, less Government interference and so on. I certainly share the Government's desire that car sharing should take place on rather a larger scale and that the Bill should endeavour to make it easier for individuals to engage in car-sharing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let us look at what might happen in a particular instance. An individual may advertise that he has room available in his car and find a response, perhaps from three or four people who work in factories close to his own place of work. The people who travel in his car may never have met before, and perhaps the only time that they will meet will be when they are travelling in that car. Therefore they never have an opportunity to discuss between themselves, what out of the hearing of the car owner, each is being charged. One can foresee that the car owner may charge each passenger slightly less than the bus fare, which would be an attractive proposition for the passengers, but that the total charged would add up to more than the cost of using the car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not make amendments Nos. 40 and 41, so no passenger will be able to argue that he is paying too much. The passengers will not know the total amount being paid and, of course, it might be possible for the car owner to make a considerable profit. Therefore, before we came to the amendment to withdraw the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
subsections I felt that we had something of an informal safeguard that was nothing to do with the courts. Presumably the Department intends that it should be well publicised that car sharing is now much easier and that people may advertise much more freely than hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would presumably be easy to make known through the media what might be a reasonable charge for certain classes of vehicle over certain distances. That seems to disappear. I am concerned that one is then thrown back on the law, rather than on the informal safeguards which seemed to be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsections did not oblige the Minister to give directions, but merely gave him reserve powers to do so. There is a case for waiting to see what happens, how the car sharing arrangements work out, and whether people are concerned that charges are too high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument closely. It has been very cogent up to this point, but I cannot see how he deduces that, as the Bill is drafted, the Minister would not necessarily have to use his powers. Subsection (3) (	<i>a</i>) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fare or aggregate of the fares paid in respect of the journey does not exceed the amount, determined by or in accordance with directions given by the Minister".</p></blockquote>
My reading of that is that unless the Minister had given the directions, one would not know whether one's car-sharing charges were legal or not. Had the hon. Gentleman taken that into account when he said that the Bill as drafted gave the Minister the option of whether or not to use his power to give directions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the right hon. Gentleman has said. However, subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) seems to me simply to say that if the Minister has given directions one has to take account of them. If he has not done so, there can presumably be no requirement for anyone to take account of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my right hon. Friend could give us his interpretation in his reply. We are all concerned that car
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
sharing should be a success. It could be argued that if we get rid of the direction about charging, we might just as well get rid of the safeguards relating to profit. With so few safeguards left, it would be easy for someone to make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is certain what the effects of car sharing will be. No one knows how many people who now travel by bus or car might be inclined to embark on car-sharing experiments. I found in my discussions with bus undertakings that they have a constructive attitude towards the Bill. They told me that they wished to take advantage of the opportunities that it presented to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise the need to ensure fair competition. Neither I nor my right hon. Friend wishes to see uneconomic bus routes disappear altogether, or that their cost should be borne by the ratepayer and taxpayer. The bus undertakings have a case for wishing to see safeguards built in. I am concerned that some of those safeguards may be withdrawn by the proposed amendments. I shall be interested to hear what my right hon. Friend has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister to clarify two points? The first relates to someone with a company car, the running costs of which are met by the company. How can such a person operate a car-sharing scheme unless he makes no charge at all? He already receives the full cost of his journey from his company. How does the Minister intend to deal with that situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are age limit and medical inspection provisions in relation to public service vehicle and taxi licence holders. Yet no such provisions are to apply to car-sharing schemes, although some of the vehicles engaged in such schemes will carry more passengers than a taxi is allowed to carry, and more than many buses carry at certain times of day. As a result of the Bill, many taxi drivers may find that they will be better off getting out of the taxi business and operating private cars on a car sharing basis instead. Will the Minister state what intentions, if any, he has in relation to age limits and medical fitness of drivers engaged in car sharing schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I fail to find any reference to medical fitness in any of the amendments. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss that matter, he should

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
have put down an amendment on the subject. He cannot go outside the considerable number of amendments that are currently under discussion. If he does so, he is inviting the Minister to go out of order in replying to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will take the point that I am making and refer to it in his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would leave the matter until the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; On the question of arrangements being made before a journey starts, may I point out to the Minister a pitfall which led to the discontinuation of one car sharing scheme? I have been advised by a friend who listens to The Archers—and I recommend the Minister to tune in to the programme because it seems to be way ahead of him in regard to transport—that a car sharing scheme was drawn up and a list showing people willing to operate it, the days they would be available and the places to which they would be going, was displayed in the local church hall. An enterprising entrepreneur—probably a Tory—promptly took up the profession of burgling the homes of people who were away on car sharing schemes shown on the list! Therefore advertising car-sharing schemes may not be such a good idea as the Minister thinks it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) will recognise that his example of the church hall advertising results directly from the 1978 Act of the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point. I did not agree with everything that the last Government did, but I am sure that the Minister does not agree with everything that the present Government are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

accused of contributing to the lengthy delays that have occurred in our proceedings so far. Yet, at the same time, Opposition Members complain when we do not speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only say that there have been few occasions when one has been stimulated to make a contribution. While we wish to continue in a spirit of amity and friendship across the Floor, we frequently feel that some of the contributions of Labour Members could have been a little briefer and more to the point. We could have made more progress and stimulated a more interesting discussion on the real issues raised by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give us an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is full of examples of matters that need debate. I suspect that during our seven sittings there have been few matters that required the lengthy deliberation and attention given to them by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) address himself to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest of pleasure, Mr. English. My main object in rising is warmly to welcome the amendments that have been tabled by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the Opposition's attitude extraordinary. We had a provision in the Bill that gave the Government direction-making powers. When the Opposition saw it they latched on to it with enthusiasm and saw it as a great opportunity to erect a whole edifice of controls and regulations which are dear to the heart of the Labour Party. Labour Ministers tabled half a dozen amendments to ensure that the direction-making powers should not remain as innocuous and innocent as originally envisaged. They wanted them to become statutory instruments to be approved by affirmative resolution with all that that involves. Presumably there would be regular revisions because of inflation, with affirmative regulations being brought before the House from time to time. There is a whole range of other proposals, including endorsement on licences and a separate fare structure for different classes of vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
The question of classes of vehicle became a grade one query in my mind when I looked at the Opposition's amendment No. 23, which seeks to define engine capacities and specifies "a limit of 100cc". The wording of that amendment suggests that they will have to find vehicles limited to 100cc. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) drives such a vehicle, but I suspect not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have this great edifice of controls and regulations so dear to the Socialist heart, and what do the Government do? They disappoint the Opposition by removing the regulation-making power altogether. The Opposition are shattered. They lose the opportunity to interfere more and more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not our position. We put down amendments to deal with the consequences of the provisions in the Bill as it stood. The Government have now decided to propose the deletion of those provisions by amendments Nos. 61 and 62.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We disagree in principle with the Government's proposals. In view of the proposed deletions, our argument now is that the Government are passing the judgment of these matters over to the courts and denying Parliament the right to make the law on this matter. That is our point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has clarified the position, because my next point was that, despite all the speeches that we have heard, the Opposition have not made clear whether they accept or reject the Government's amendments. In all the words that they have poured forth, they could have made their position clear. One had the impression that they preferred their own philosophy of a structure of regulation and control. But even after the hon. Gentleman's intervention, it is still not clear whether he intends to vote against the Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that car sharing will transform the transport pattern of Great Britain, but it is worth while and can make a contribution, particularly in areas where transport facilities are non-existent or totally inadequate. There may be no bus service at all, or there may be times when the buses do not operate. If car sharing is to develop in those areas, it would be foolish to lay down from Whitehall too
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
many rules and regulations which—let us fact it—are unlikely ever to become known to the hundreds of thousands of people who we hope will be operating informal car sharing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said last week that the direction-making power would not have been a statutory instrument. It might have been just a letter. I was immediately intrigued to know to whom such a letter would have been written. I am not sure what status such a letter would have had. Certainly, it would be unlikely to have wide circulation among millions of car-owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would have received the letter, and who would have been responsible for enforcement? I cannot believe that the letter would have gone to the licensing authorities, because I do not believe that it would be their duty to enforce this matter. I suspect that it would simply be a matter for the police. To whom, then, would one send the letter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a serious point and I hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with it later. Under the proposal as amended, how will enforcement occur on those rare occasions when it will be relevant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxi operators will need protection and might invoke enforcement. I do not think that the provisions will present any problem to the bus operators, but there will be legitimate regulated taxi operators who will see that in some areas one or two people might be developing an unregulated taxi service. Those taxi operators will then have the right to complain. To whom will they complain and produce evidence that so and so is operating and making a profit, or breaking the rules on advertising and so on? Is it simply a police matter? If so, does it go before a licensing authority or straight to the courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has omitted the real point, which is that if a Government—the previous Government also introduced car sharing proposals—begin to lay down a whole host of regulations, enforcement will not be any eas-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
ier. It will simply result in the whole system becoming unworkable. The majority of people will be so put off by bureaucratic intervention that they will not dare to become involved. If the amount that one can charge is dependent on the size of the vehicle it will become so complicated that informal car sharing will not work. I am sure that the Opposition want it to work, as we do, and to make a significant contribution. With the regular changes in rates and fare structures it would be utterly silly for the Government to become involved in regulation-making powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill simply lays down the charge should not exceed the running costs of the vehicle for the journey and that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the running costs... shall be taken to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
The Bill therefore lays down the general principle, and that seems to make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the interesting question of what happens when there are complaints, although I suspect that they will be few and far between. Basically it must be right—I hope that the Opposition will accept this—for the Government to become involved as little as possible. We are talking of informal arrangements between friends and neighbours, not a regulated taxi system. That being so, it would be foolish for the Government to start issuing a whole host of regulations. Therefore, I welcome strongly the new approach by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on the remarks of the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). I share his views on the inappropriate nature of a letter giving directions from the Minister, but I have great reservations about the rest of his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disturbed to hear the hon. Gentleman describe as innocuous a power by a Minister to give directions without an affirmative resolution by the House or some other procedure for controlling such directions I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member will regret what he said in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was mistaken when he spoke of two possibilities—the arrangement proposed by the Government in the Bill as drafted and the arrangement proposed by the Govern-

ment's amendments. There are, in fact, three possibilities, as the hon. Member would have realised if he had listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary at our last sitting. I reject the hon. Gentleman's call for the Opposition to state at the outset whether they accept or reject a Government amendment. It is reasonable for an Opposition, when faced by a Government amendment to a Government Bill, to reflect on the consequences of the amendment and to probe and question it. It is wrong for an Opposition —indeed the hon. Gentleman would denounce us if we did so—to reject amendments before hearing what the Minister has to say in answer to legitimate points and queries that we raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Parliamentary Secretary confessed at our last sitting, legislation often has loopholes. I am willing to accept; what the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have said about not wanting to open the door to profit-making arrangements, and that their object is to have car-sharing arrangements among, as the hon. Member for Faversham said, friends and neighbours. But the Government are going much further than that because it is possible under the Bill to advertise for people to come into car-sharing arrangements. Saying therefore, that the Bill is just to allow informal arrangements between neighbours and friends is not an accurate summary of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Government's good intentions, and that they are seeking not to open up profit-making opportunities for entrepreneurs, but to minimise energy costs by encouraging people making the same journey to share a car. But we all know that the good intentions of Governments often lead, through legislation, to mistakes being made and unintended opportunities being created. It is right, therefore, that we should examine the effect of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that there are three possibilities. The first, which the Government initially proposed, is to issue directions specifying the charges or fares that could be made. The Parliamentary Secretary gave some very cogent reasons why that should not be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second possibility is to give a broad indication that fares should not exceed running costs, and to leave the courts to decide those running costs. That is the Government's latest thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
The third possibility is for the Bill to specify what running costs are. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that third possibility on our previous sitting, but he skated over and avoided the reasons for the Government's decision not to adopt that course. I hope that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will go into that possibility in more detail, because there is some looseness in the Minister's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the reason the Minister has decided against specifying the running costs is that he does not know what running costs are. He has not yet come to a conclusion. I hope that we shall be told more when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depreciation and general wear are the only running costs specified in the Bill. The notes that we have received, and to which reference has already been made, say that it is the Government's intention that the fare, or total fares, shall not exceed basic costs. However, there is a difference between basic costs and running cost. At our previous sitting the Parliamentary Secretary made clear that he believed that running costs should include not only depreciation and general wear, but petrol and oil, as we expected, and road tax and insurance, which may be basic costs, but are not running costs. They do not vary according to the mileage for which the vehicle is used. Road tax and insurance are fixed costs. They are not variable, and are not related to the number or length of journeys made by the vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not clarified that matter. They do not know what they want to be covered by the fare or total fares. For example, is it their intention that the interest on the hire purchase of a car should be included as a running cost? It could be argued that that is a basic cost of a vehicle, but it is certainly not a running cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the Government's intention that the rent of a car should be counted towards running costs? If a driver rents his car will he be able to apportion the rent over the number of people in the car in order to determine the fare or total fares? There is also the cost of car parking, which could be a running cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An expensive part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could, as my hon. Friend says, be an expensive part of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
I do not believe that the Government are trying to create profit opportunities or that they want car-sharing opportunities to be used by unscrupulous people to enter into business to make money. I accept the Government's good intentions. But let us suppose that a driver who is, say, a shopkeeper or shop manager, is using his own car park at the end of his journey and that he includes in his running costs a proportion of the cost of maintaining the car park. From an accounting point of view that could be argued to be a legitimate cost and I can see great opportunities for profit in that sort of accountancy and arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose a man wants to exploit the loophole opened by the clause and includes in his running costs a charge for his own garage when he garages his car overnight. It could be argued that that would not be allowed because he would be making a profit. But let us suppose that his garage and house are held in his wife's name and that he actually pays her a large sum of money ostensibly for garaging his car overnight. The Bill does not say that there should be no opportunity for making a profit out of car-sharing arrangements by making not one but several journeys in a day. There is nothing in the Bill to say that a car driver shall make only one car-sharing return journey a day and it is quite open to being fiddled in that way. I know that the Government do not intend the Bill to be a fiddler's charter, but we know that people fiddle and that if we leave loopholes in legislation they will find a way through them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that in the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary it is definitely not possible to include any form of remuneration for a driver in the running costs. But suppose that the passengers come to a separate arrangement to remunerate a driver and that they have a separate contract with a driver to employ him, as a driver or as something else. Can the Parliamentary Secretary state that there is no way around the possibility of a driver being self-employed or employed by someone else and remunerated in a manner which is not in accordance with the Minister's intention in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is one thing that needs clearing up and agreeing upon—if there is anything in the Bill that can be agreed—it is the fact that the Minister was at least keeping some form of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
control—the word which the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) does not like. In other words, there was provision for the Minister to make some directions to give some credence to the wish that no profit should be made. If there were any doubt about where the Opposition stood on that issue, one would need only to look at our amendments which sought not to take away that direction from the Minister, but to give it some teeth and a feasible method of working which were lacking. If one looks through the notes sent by the Minister before he tabled the amendment, when he was defending the clauses as they stood, one sees that paragraph 16 says that clause 2:
	<br><blockquote><p>"enables the Minister to give directions as to how the journey costs of the vehicle are to be measured."</p></blockquote>
If there were only one reason why the words of clause 2 should stay it is surely that the Minister's own words recognised that need when the clause was drawn up. Therefore, it will be interesting to discover the reasons for taking out those words, as proposed in amendment No. 61.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important aspect is revealed by the Minister's notes. He may not have written them, but he surely read them and agreed that they were in order. Paragraph 16 goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power to give direction is drafted widely".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of some of our amendments was to give some teeth to that power. But the notes go on to defend that wide drafting and explain that it was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in order to enable there to be full consultation about the most appropriate form and details."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable argument. The Minister had powers of direction in the Bill. As a great democrat and believer in open government he was saying "Although I have this power of direction I will provide the opportunity to consult on the most appropriate form and details". I do not welcome many matters in the Bill but I would have welcomed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would have given the opportunity for all the aspects raised by the Opposition—some of which may not be thought to be applicable and some which it may be thought will not happen—to receive
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
consideration, with the Minister having ultimate responsibility to make directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 17 of the notes says clause 2 provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that an Order may fix the same amount of money for journeys of different lengths or for journeys of the same length made by vehicles of different descriptions."</p></blockquote>
Again, the Minister was standing by the words that have so often been used in the Committee, namely that it is not a profit-making exercise. He justified that by saying that he could make sure it was not a profit-making exercise by giving a directive. We fell out with that because we wanted a harder line of direction. We did not fall out with the fact that ultimate responsibility lies with Parliament and with the Minister, and not outside where there can be numerous different decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said he would rely on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the commonsense judgment of tribunals and courts to decide the facts of the case on the evidence."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 17 January 1980; c. 277.]</p></blockquote>
A court may sit in Newcastle, consider evidence and arrive at a decision. A court in London may consider similar evidence and arrive at a different conclusion. The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say, as he has repeatedly said, that car sharing is not to be a profit-making exercise if, in the same breath, he abdicates his responsibility to ensure that that does not happen. Surely, by taking out the power of direction that is precisely what he is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that we are making mountains out of molehills, that this is merely an exercise among friends who get together and agree on a journey. If so, the Government cannot have two bites at the cherry. One cannot say, on the one hand, that it is an exercise among friends who will get together and share the cost and, at the same time, include in the Bill the power to advertise. If there is an arrangement among friends to organise a journey, why is there a need to advertise? That is another explanation which the Minister could have given in his notes. Certainly the Minister would have been able to back up his words that there was to be no profit-making with concrete fact, because he would have made that certain in a directive.

I am repeatedly drawn to a speech on Second Reading that is nearly my bible. Whenever Conservative Members indicate that it is only Opposition Members who are worried about the Bill I am drawn back to the Second Reading speech of the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall), who made his remarks before the Minister saw fit to take out his power of direction. The hon. Gentleman was concerned then, and goodness knows what he feels now. I remind the Committee that I am quoting a Conservative Member and not a Labour Member. The hon. Member for Ilford, North said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is also concern about the monitoring of costs. The Minister may provide for a given fare for a vehicle of a given horse-power over a given distance. How can the authorities monitor whether the correct fare is being charged? It is difficult to see how charging and running costs will be dealt with."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol 974, c. 1173.]</p></blockquote>
If that was difficult when the Minister had the power to make directives, how much more difficult will it be now that he has completely abdicated that responsibility and left the matter as a free-for-all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, there is a telling point that I should like to raise. The Opposition tabled their amendments on the understanding that such directions would remain in the Bill. Had there been no power of directive these amendments would have been worded differently. In fact, they were to become part of the directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting constitutional point has arisen. We are discussing Government amendments Nos 61 and 62, together with amendments Nos. 28, 22, 23, 24, 45 and 25. If one takes the example of amendment No. 28, one finds that it was valid when it was tabled. At that time, the Government had not seen fit to table their two amendments. Amendment No. 28 sought to impose some legal restriction on anyone who was overcharging. Now, as I understand it, if Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62 are carried—which is likely—amendment No. 28 will no longer be valid, because it relies on the fact that the Government were to impose a power of direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that power is removed, as amendments Nos. 61 and 62 seek, we are placed in a difficult position. Had we known that in time, we may well have worded our amendment differently, so as to include an appropriate power. Therefore, I won-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
der whether you could give an opinion on that matter, Mr. English, because what I want to say—and I do not wish to incur your wrath—must depend to a large extent on your ruling. If you decide that when Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62 are carried, all the others fall, we shall be in difficulty, because our amendments—which we tabled before the Government put down their own—were based on the assumption that the power of direction would remain. Had we known that the Government were even considering the removal of the power it is possible that we would have worded our amendments differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. In the light of the interesting point made by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall we see whether that happens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. That clears—even if it does not entirely satisfy me—the line along which I was progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote something from my well-known bible—the report of Second Reading proceedings on the Bill. The hon. Member for Ilford, North said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am concerned about protection for the public on car-sharing."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol.974, c.1174.]</p></blockquote>
The Government seek to take out the power of direction. I share with my hon. Friends a grave suspicion not only of Governments who seek to give away powers but of anyone in public service who does so. That seldom occurs unless—and I think that this is what has happened with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
the Minister—it is suddenly decided that it would be extremely difficult to implement those powers. In this case, if undoubtedly would be difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that when the Bill was drafted the Minister saw the power to make directions as one of the major planks in supporting his argument that no one would make a profit, because he would say "Ah, but I have laid down the direction." But suddenly, on reflection—perhaps in the middle of the night—he thought: "But I am the man who will have to implement it, and it is extremely difficult." I certainly agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not a logical argument to say that because something is difficult it should be taken out. As I have said before, I find little in the Bill to agree with, except with the proposal that Parliament, through the Minister, should retain control. The Minister has given some rules and laid down guidelines for direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the valuable point made by the hon. Member for Faversham when he spoke about taxi drivers. Again, the subject of a directive arose. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that many in that line of business were concerned about the Bill. Some of that concern—but by no means all of it; there are other aspects of the problem into which I do not wish to go at this stage—could have been alleviated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point on which the direction-making power made a lot of sense was that if the Minister laid down a direction—which could have included a maximum level in the fare structure, which would ensure that nobody made a profit—that would have made his position basically correct. It would also have cleared up those areas where, whether we like it or not, there may be a certain amount of competition. That could have been done by laying down a directive on cost, which—although it would not take away the competition; and I do not believe that the Minister would want to do that—would have removed the chance of unfair competition, which I believe he would like to have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, by taking out the direction he is negating, the choice and the opportunity to do that. Therefore, we come back to those other forms of business—namely, taxi and private hire firms—who will now be left bare. I refer only to fares, although there are many other matters involved. They will not have any protection whatever, because the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
Minister has abdicated from giving such direction. That is a valid point. I am sure that many of those in such businesses will be aghast at the Minister's taking this line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman can no longer say, with any credibility, that there will be no profit-making in this respect. He could not say that with much credibility when the power was in the clause, but he certainly cannot say it when it is removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Minister's position be if—as I suspect will happen—there are different rulings from tribunals or courts across the country, sometimes in similar cases? How can the Minister argue whether there will be profit or loss if he passes the power to tribunals or courts throughout the country, all making different decisions on what is profitable. How can he justify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Minister's answer be to those unfortunate people—unfortunate if the Bill is enacted—who already earn their livelihood in small-scale transport businesses such as taxi and car hire when they ask, "How can you, a defender of the rights of fair competition, which we understand is one of your policies, abdicate from a responsibility that puts us in this situation. We have to earn our bread and butter, our livelihood, but you, the small businessman's friend, run away from making a direction which would at least give us fair competition."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, could have said, "You may have reservations, but at least I will give a direction that will ensure that you have a fair and even chance". But the right hon. Gentleman is now saying to those unfortunate people "I had that opportunity and I ran away from it. It would be far better if you go into the car-sharing business."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could argue that they will not make a living out of that business, but how will the situation be monitored if the Minister takes away the power of direction? Is the Minister relying on a court? How will a case get to court? If there is a direction there is every likelihood of a case getting to court, because if anyone disobeyed the Minister's direction there would be a court case. But if the opportunity to make a direction is taken away, how will a case get into a court or tribunal? How can the Minister monitor whether there is a profit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
Under a direction there is at least some form of control—although we argued that the Government proposals were not strong enough and that other points could have been included. But at least there would have been some form of control—that nasty word. Control is necessary to protect the public. Self control is also very good, and I am trying to exercise that so that I do not go on too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a direction, one has some form of control. In taking that away that power the Minister is abdicating from his responsibility. I have said that before, but it loses nothing by being said again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief in order to satisfy the Conservative ex-Trappists. It is always portrayed in the mythology of the Conservative Party that its members are practical men of the world and understand what a squalid world we live in, while Labour Party members, if not raving madmen are starry-eyed idealists who do not understand anything about the world, but if clause 2 is passed, with the inclusion of Government amendment Number 61, it will be on the basis that the world, and particularly the transport world, is peopled almost exclusively by Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. It will be a most peculiar world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be relying entirely on the good will and decency of everybody involved in car sharing. Anyone who decides to base his law on car sharing on that basis wants his head examined. I am not suggesting that people engaged in car sharing will drift into the car hire business, without observing the regulations that go with car hire or running hackney carriages, but a substantial number of hackney carriage or hire car operators outside the main met-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
ropolitan areas do another job as well. I think that some Conservative Members accept that that is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people could start using the advertising provisions in schedule 1 to get a number of people, not necessarily neighbours or friends, but people for whom they had touted, to share their journey to their place of work. Let us imagine the effect of the provisions on Mr. X, who works in a factory during the day and makes up his income in the evenings by running a small car hire business or a hackney carriage. It seems possible that, with the best will in the world, he will start running in effect a profit-making car hire service between his home and his place of work as a result of these provisions. There will be a drift into that sort of arrangement by people who are at present in the car hire or hackney carriage business and therefore covered by regulations and other arrangements designed to secure the interests of the passengers. The result of the provisions may even be that such a people will gradually drift out of the controlled and protected area and shuffle round in this sort of near-beer business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to be putting before us all and I mean all of us, including those Conservative Members who are actually paying any attention to the issues—a Bill that will turn into a total mess the whole structure of our small-scale public transport by hackney carriages, hire cars and small public service vehicles. Some Conservative Members should take that on board. They are supposed to be protecting the interests of their own and everyone else's constituents. They normally proclaim themselves to be realistic men of the world, and they will recognise that the possibilities outlined by me and my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), are likely to arise. It is not to the benefit of the travelling public that the arrangements designed to secure passenger safety and to avoid fiddling become murky and difficult to interpret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say "Let the courts decide". But it will not be the courts that have the trouble. The courts will not be going out to stop people. That job will fall to some poor policeman. We hear a great deal of claptrap from Conservative Members about trying to make life easier for the police. This minor measure will certainly make life infinitely more difficult for the police when they have to control

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
traffic and motoring offences in the areas in which the Bill's provisions will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), does not agree, I have a suggestion for him. As we can reasonably expect that the Bill will pass into law roughly in its present form, I suggest that, a year after this part of the Bill comes into operation, he goes to a rural area where there are hackney carriages, hire cars, minibuses and various hire arrangements established under the Bill and do what the police may have to do if it is suggested that an individual or group of individuals is breaking the law, which is to stop the car and determine what sort of journey is being undertaken, and whether the journey is within the law. I defy him to do that without the expenditure of a great deal of his time. And if it takes a lot of his time, it will take a lot of police time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good saying that we in Parliament will not decide what the law shall be, and that the courts will decide. Courts make such decisions only if cases are put before them. It will be necessary for the police to put the cases before them, because, as Conservative Members ought to have noticed, the traffic commissioners will no longer have any function in relation to such vehicles. In the past it has been possible for the commissioners to draw attention to offences, but if clause 2 is approved they will no longer have a role. The Government are making life difficult for all those categories of people whom they commonly claim to represent, and whose interests they try to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to have got us into a right old mess. First he proposed that clause 2 should include some powers of regulation. Then, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central has said, faced with the problem of having to carry out the monitoring that he originally wanted, he has decided that he cannot do it. He is running away from that responsibility. He is leaving it all to the police so that the situation will be very messy for those poor people who will have to operate the Bill when it becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on the batch of amendments has understandably been confined to Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62. I am making no complaint about that. In the circumstances it is completely understandable. However, I wish to make some points about the Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
amendments that are being taken with the Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I do so, I must say that the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) did the Committee a signal service in raising a possible alternative to the Government amendments. I found his argument about the undesirability of having the courts do what otherwise be done by ministerial directive in the Bill extremely cogent. It behoves us to be a little reticent in predicting exactly how the legislation will work. If the Bill is passed in its present form, and with the inclusion of the two Government amendments, none of us can be certain whether how many cases, if any, would be taken to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on the advice that we have had from the Government so far, it seems that if the two amendments were passed, the Government would withdraw from the whole business. The only way that someone could be prosecuted for being in breach of the law under clause 2 (3) would be if a complaint were made to the police and a policeman challenged a driver that he was charging fares over and above the cost of running the vehicle. The case would then go to the courts. If that happens, the court will have to make decisions. It is no good our complaining about that. The courts' decisions may become precedents. I do not know how wide those precedents will be, but if such decisions were not taken as precedents, situations could arise that would be contrary to the Minister's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary could not have made it any clearer when he said that he wished to see an infinite variety of flexible arrangements. If people are under the impression that the only circumstances in which they will know whether they are operating legally or otherwise is if they are challenged and the matter goes to court, they may be deterred from car sharing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
