	<p>[	<i>Continuation from col. 1104.</i>]</p>
	<p>2.15 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to remind the Committee of the detail of clause 18. Clause 18 sets the scene for the new system of PSV operator licensing. There is no great change of policy here. We all agree that controls over the safety of public service vehicle operations are of fundamental importance. Those controls are basically unchanged. What we propose is a change in the licensing system which puts them into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A brief look at the present system will reveal why a change is necessary. What we have at the moment is an unhappy marriage between the requirements of an EEC directive, aimed primarily at operators, and United Kingdom legislation dating from the 1930s, aimed at the vehicles. The marriage was inevitable at the time my predecessors had to implement the EEC access directive since primary legislation was not really available. It is available now, and the industry would think we had failed in our duty if we did not take this opportunity to try to produce a more logical, more sensible and less bureaucratic system than we have at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, we are replacing the annual licensing of every public service vehicle by the licensing of operators for up to five years. We have considered the previous three clauses with great care. I hope we have convinced Labour Members that, in those clauses, controls on the safety of individual vehicles are being maintained at a high level. Clause 18 and the following clauses will ensure that only satisfactory operators are allowed to enter and remain in the industry, and that there is some surveillance of the way in which they look after their vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18 provides the basic framework. Public service vehicles may be used for hire and reward only under an operator's licence. Penalties are laid down for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
contravention of this requirement. Licences are issued by the traffic commissioners for the traffic area in which the operating centre for the vehicles is situated, but a licence covers the use of vehicles by the licence-holder throughout Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to what we are proposing. I think it fair to say that the change we are making is important. It has been welcomed by the industry. We should be much criticised were we to let pass this opportunity to legislate in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) raised points concerning the extension of the clause. They asked whether the system for operator licensing could go wider than it does at present. At the moment it covers stage, express and contract carriage. As the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness said, works buses and school buses are not within the system at present. The position goes back to 1930; it has not suddenly appeared. It is true that we are not seeking to extend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that there is a distinct difference between hire and reward, in holding oneself open to the public and the kind of examples that the right hon. Gentleman gave. He gave the example of the works bus and the school bus. Particularly in the case of the school bus, the local education authority can be deemed to take care of the safety aspects of that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I can go further. We have absolutely no evidence that either works buses or school buses have presented a particular problem in recent years in relation to security and safety. But, in addition, the EEC road-worthiness directive will mean that for those vehicles, too, there will be the yearly inspection, and the annual check system will come into being in 1982. We already have The Motor Vehicles (Tests) Regulations 1976, and The Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1978. So I hope that both the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend will accept that, although the present situation is different, there is no question that we are in an unchecked situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find—unusually for me— some reassurance in what my right hon. Friend says about the EEC regulations in this respect. But he said that the EEC regulations would require that other vehicles—for example, works buses—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
should have annual inspection. Am I right in assuming that that will require further United Kingdom legislation? Clearly, it will not be necessary for public service vehicles, because they will be covered by this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will require regulation, and that regulation will be introduced. We dealt with that matter at an earlier stage in the Committee's deliberations. The intent and guarantee that I can give the Committee is that annual checks will be introduced, and I hope that that information will be of considerable reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned separate licences in each area where the operator has an operating centre. The operating centre is defined as the place where the person ordinarily keeps his buses; it is a question of fact. We are concerned that a check is made on the maintenance facilities. That does not mean that the operator has to have his own maintenace facilities—the maintenance facilities may be under contract to him— but that he must satisfy the traffic commissioners that there is a basic maintenance facility available to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This system is welcomed by the industry. I believe that those working within the industry, the trade unions, will also welcome it. I hope that the Committee will allow clause 18 to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>CLASSIFICATION OF LICENCES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 18, line 13, leave out from "authorise" to end of line 15 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operation of one or more of the following type of service—
	<ol>
	<li>regular services at separate fares,</li>
	<li>regular services under contract,</li>
	<li>extended tours,</li>
	<li>occasional services other than extended tours,</li>
	<li>international services</li></ol>
and for the purpose of this subsection 'regular service' has the meaning given by article 1 of Regulation (EEC) 117/66; 'occasional service' means any service which is not a regular service; 'extended tour' means any service which includes the provision by the operator within the overall charge for the tour of hotel or other overnight accommodation for those persons travelling; 'international service' means any journey in the course of which the vehicle leaves the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1108</span>
Once again, I risk being accused of putting forward the arguments of the operators, which have been made available to all members of the Committee. As on other occasions when I have put forward such arguments—on this occasion they were given to us by the National Bus Company—I am conscious of the need to find other arguments to deploy. I certainly made the point today at lunchtime, although I do not know whether I can offer that defence for the present amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the classification of licences into the categories of standard and restricted licences. The amendment seeks to define more clearly the standard licence. The present drafting defines it as the licence applicable for public service vehicles
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) on both national and international operations; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>)on national operations only."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has the amendment before him and will no doubt already have prepared his arguments for accepting or rejecting it. However, I am bound to say that it seems reasonable for an operator to suggest that we be more precise about the definition of a standard licence. If we define it in the way suggested that may well add to the clarity of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment suggests the insertion of the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operation of one or more of the following types of service".</p></blockquote>
That is in line with the "one or more licences" mentioned earlier. It makes a clear distinction between
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) regular services at separate fares",</p></blockquote>
which we know as stage carriage, and
	<br><blockquote><p> "(	<i>b</i>) regular services under contract,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) extended tours"—</p></blockquote>
the point has been made that there are different levels of financial commitment to every kind of service, and that that should be taken into account when it is being considered whether licences should be suspended—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>d</i>) occasional services other than extended tours,"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) international services".</p></blockquote>
The amendment also lays down that "regular service" should be defined as in
	<br><blockquote><p>"article 1 of Regulation (EEC) 117/66",</p></blockquote>
and that "occasional service" should mean
	<br><blockquote><p>"any service which is not a regular service".</p></blockquote>
The other definitions are self-explanatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1109</span>
The real purpose of the amendment is to ask whether the Minister is prepared to define a standard licence more closely than does the present rather bald wording. Does the Minister agree that the amendment would help to make the clause more definitive about the classification of licences? I think that it would be particularly relevant to any actions that the authorities concerned might take against licence holders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has said, clause 19(2), to which the amendment applies, divides standard operators' licences into two categories, national and international. That split is required by the access directive, since professional competence in a wider range of subjects is required for international operations. The hon. Gentleman's amendment is supported by those who argue that some types of service require greater skills, ability and financial resources than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who may quite properly be allowed to run a private hire coach business would be unable to run a public stage carriage service, with the high degree of organisation and commitment required, or a business of holidays and extended tours, where a different, but equally high, level of organisation is required and there must be large financial resources. The Government's reaction to the amendment is that what the hon. Gentleman proposes is contrary to the spirit of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it at its mildest and most conservative, but it is at least a partial replacement for road service licensing. It invents controls and restrictions and would require considerable enforcement effort. Moreover, as it stands, it would be unworkable by the traffic commissioners. It gives them no guidelines on how to decide which types of licences to grant to an applicant and when and in what circumstances to grant him less than he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it had been desired to have such controls, the Bill should have included criteria, perhaps provisions for objections, representations, public sittings and certainly provisions for appeal. The traffic commissioners are known to dislike the idea of making such judgments of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, we are determined to have the simplest and least bureaucratic form of quality controls. The amendment brings in new and complex restrictions on what
	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
operators may do and I believe that it will only hinder new services if the operator in a trial area, for example, needs to get a new licence before he can undertake stage carriage business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill removes controls, rather than seeking to impose new ones. If I may summarise the argument, the traffic commissioners would have no grounds for determining which licences to give an applicant unless there were far more criteria in the Bill than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's desire to protect consumers, but he will clearly recognise that the Government believe that competition should help to do that and that continuing demonstrated incompetence might lead traffic commissioners to doubt the fitness of persons to hold operators' licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction between national and international is required by the EEC access directive and that is all there is to the distinction in the Bill. I regret that I must advise the Committee to reject the amendment on the grounds that it is contrary to what we seek to achieve and it would create more problems than it would solve, even from the standpoint on the Bill legitimately taken by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 18, line 22, leave out "(i)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 172, in page 18, line 23, leave out from "passengers" to end of line 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 173, in page 18, line 27, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 150, in page 18, line 31, at end add "or for the conveyance of schoolchildren".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making rapid progress and I should like to make a further contribution to the rapidity of that progress by wrapping amendments Nos. 171 and 172 together before going on to say something about amendment No. 173. I shall leave to my hon. Friends the case for amendment No. 150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combined effect of amendments Nos. 171 and 172 would be to delete subparagraph (ii) from clause 19(3)(	<i>b</i>), and thereby address the question whether it is equitable that operators of vehicles designed for carrying nine to 16 passengers should always qualify for a restricted public
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1111</span>
service vehicle operator's licence without having to meet the requirements of professional competence needed for a standard licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, that question would arise even in the case of an operator whose public service vehicle operation was designed to be fully commercial, provided it did not constitute 50 per cent. of his total business. This seems to be nonsense. The test imposed in the Bill—whether or not it is 50 per cent. of the owner's business—can have no relevance to a classification of licences which is intended to couple logically with a series of other provisions in the Bill to make for a safe, efficient, competent operation in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public interest is not touched upon, as far as I can see, by the question whether a commercial bus operation is 50 per cent., or more or less, of the total operation owned by the owner of that service. That aspect of clause 19 should be amended so that we can get down to other and more contentious aspects. If that part is contentious, no doubt those who wish to defend it will explain how they do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of this size of public service vehicle on non-commercial operations would qualify the operator for a restricted licence under subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>)(i). But it is contended by a number of people in the industry that it would be right for commercial use of such vehicles if the operator were obliged to meet professional competence requirements for standard licences. Therefore, they argue, it should be governed by the obligations and controls on those licences. I can find no argument to pose against the people in the industry who state that. I can see no reason why someone who is running vehicles in that category on a business basis should be exempted from the qualifications of professional competence that are attached to running other bus operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments, therefore, are addressed to two straightforward and clear issues. The first is about the effect of a criterion that has no bearing on the effect on the public of the running of the operation. A strange financial yardstick—what other operations an operator owns—has been chosen to decide whether he qualifies. Presumably a man who at present is running a bus operation using this type of vehicle—constituting, say, 75 per cent. of his business and therefore not qualifying under this arrangement—can if he has the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1112</span>
money buy another business operation quite unrelated to the first, and, provided it were large enough, build up his total operation such that his bus operating section was less than 50 per cent. In those circumstances, he is not likely to be any more efficient a bus operator who requires to be considered in a different classification of licence. I think that that way of dealing with the problem is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I could not believe that the Bill intended this to be a logical contribution towards our domestic law, I turned my mind in the direction of EEC legislation to see whether this part of the clause was intended to meet specific EEC requirements or to advantage some of our citizens in this country. I cannot find that it is completely covered by the access directive. Perhaps the Minister will help us by saying whether this is, as it appears to be, only part covered by the access directive. If that is so, will the Minister explain to the Committee so that we can consider seriously how far this is relevant to the way the access directive bites on this country? If it is only part covered, as I suppose, what is the justification for doing it in that way? I should like to hear the Minister's reply before I attempt to develop those arguments to see if there is any justification for the two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 173, which proposes to leave out subsection (4). I believe that it is required to ensure that where any local or public authority operates vehicles designed to carry anywhere between nine and 16 passengers on a commercial basis that public authority will be required to hold a standard public service operator's licence rather than a restricted licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest in any way that public authorities are not good vehicle operators. They can be very good operators, but I do not think that public authorities are seeking to have some advantage in running on a restricted licence or in not having to meet good operators' requirements. I hope that they will welcome the amendment, as in the case of the other two amendments in this group, Nos. 171 and 172.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities should, if they wish to operate vehicles commercially—which will be the case in very many instances—be obliged to meet the requirements of professional competence which are needed for standard licences. The authorities should also be covered by the obligations and controls of such licences. I see no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1113</span>
reason to exempt public authorities from standards of competence and licencing merely because they have chosen to operate vehicles within this category of nine to 16 passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is of particular significance. In the case of local education authority-operated school buses we now have to envisage charges being made as a result of the Education Bill. Whether those charges are made directly or indirectly for the conveyance of pupils under that Bill, the case becomes stronger for saying that whoever operates the bus charges fares to convey people to school and should meet standards of operator competence which would not be required if the amendment is not passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the two serious issues. There is also the issue to be resolved on amendment No. 150, which my hon. Friend will move. When we have heard his contribution and that of the Minister, we can turn to the justification for amendments Nos. 171 and 172, when we know how far the EEC access directive bites upon our law in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to the amendments to subsection (4). Amendment No. 171 proposes the deletion of the subsection, while amendment No. 150 proposes the addition of the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or for the conveyance of schoolchildren"</p></blockquote>
at the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in an earlier debate, I see no reason why buses conveying schoolchildren to and from school should be subject—in this clause as well as in the earlier one—to a lower standard of safety, and lower demands, in this case, on the professional competence of those operating the buses. There is no justification for not imposing as high a standard of safety on buses intended to transport schoolchildren as for any other vehicle. Indeed, it could be argued that, owing to the extent to which children are captive passengers, they are entitled to a higher standard of safety than are other types of passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. It is unjustifiable and disgraceful that the House has continued—not merely in this Bill, but during the past few years—to allow the provision of school transport to be subject to less rigorous restraint and control than applies to other transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask you a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1114</span>
question, Mr. Dean. When discussing a list of amendments of this nature, it has been the practice to debate and divide on the first amendment and allow the others to fall by the wayside. Is that to be the situation now? Amendment No. 150 is vital even if the other three fall. Will you allow a Division on one amendment only?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating this group of amendments together. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to have a separate Division on any one of the others, I am prepared to listen to his request at the appropriate moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Dean. After listening to the arguments, I hope that my hon. Friends will agree to divide on amendment No. 150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All through our proceedings on the Bill, we have heard the Government express their concern for the safety of the travelling public and nowhere is the necessity for safety more apparent than in vehicles conveying schoolchildren to and from school. Those vehicles are carrying the future of this country, and it seems reasonable to expect the Minister to stretch theory into practice by accepting amendment No. 150.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that general measures apply, but I doubt that from the clause. Even if he did argue along those lines, I would counter by saying that amendment No. 150 is specific in providing for children. I am not concerned with existing provisions. If anything has gone wrong in the past, this is the ideal opportunity to rectify matters for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without labouring the point too much, the amendment speaks for itself. If we ask for certain areas of restriction and exclude schoolchildren, that is a crying disgrace. I hope that my hon. Friends will ask for a Division on amendment No. 150, if for no other reason than to write specifically into the Bill our concern for the conveyance of schoolchildren and to make the standards for schoolchildren the same as we provide for everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important series of amendments and I shall deal with them in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 171 and 172 were tabled in the name of the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness. They seek to remove one of the categories of use covered by restricted licence, namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Public service vehicles not adapted to carry more than 16 passengers when used…by a person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1115</span>
whose main occupation is not the operation of public service vehicles adapted to carry more than eight passengers."</p></blockquote>
Operators in that category would need a standard licence and professional competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sub-paragraph that the amendment seeks to remove was drafted in order to take maximum advantage of the powers of derogation from the EEC access directive. Article 1 of that directive gives member States the power to exempt operators:
	<br><blockquote><p>"having a main occupation other than that of road passenger transport operator".</p></blockquote>
It is defined to restrict it to the operation of vehicles for more than nine persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a few operators of hire-car businesses who also own and operate a minibus or two. If the amendment were made, they would have to hold standard licences and therefore have to satisfy the professional competence requirement. The present PSV licensing system exempts them and the amendment would impose a new limitation. Although there are probably only a handful of such operators, in my view it is an important principle that they should be encouraged and certainly not subjected to conditions that the EEC does not require that they should be subjected to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the sub-paragraph continues the maximum derogation from the access directive allowed to us by the EEC. The sort of operation referred to is the taxi or hire-car proprietor who also runs a few minibuses. Under the present law he does not require standard public service vehicle licences for those minibuses, and the Bill will not require him to have a standard operator's licence, but the amendment would have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt of the facts between the Government and the Opposition on this—it is a matter of judgment as to how one interprets those facts. Speaking for the Government, I do not wish to impose on the operator the need to satisfy the professional competence requirement when the access directive does not require that. It would be taking an absurd extension for the sake of a small number of people who we may want to encourage to run minibuses, particularly in the rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I heard my hon. Friend say that he thought it desirable to gain the maximum possible exemption from the EEC directive with regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
requirements of professional competence. Do I understand him to say that he regards the requirements as contributing little to safety and management standards in this country, that they are an unnecessary burden on the transport industry and that we apply them only because it is a requirement of the EEC directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend takes me into territory which both of us, when in opposition, trod over. Having seen the sort of examinations which are approved by the Royal Society of Arts, I, like my hon. Friend, have doubts about the general utility of such examinations. The requirement was laid down in 1977. I do not criticise it. I do not think that the previous Government had any choice in the matter. We did not feel, given the obligation, that we could oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I make the modest point that, whatever our opinions might be, it does not make a great deal of sense to extend the requirement when the EEC does not advocate that it should be extended. Of course that is a matter of opinion. I respect the opinion of the right hon. Gentleman on that. I do not believe that there is any disagreement on the facts. It is a matter of judgment whether it is right or wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 173. The provision in subsection (4) is taken from the Public Service Vehicle Operators (Qualifications) Regulations 1977, which were introduced by the previous Government, and were the instruments by which they implemented the EEC access directive. The subsection is designed to enable local authorities, social service departments and so on, to carry passengers in minibuses in return for payment, without having a transport manager who complies with the requirement for professional competence. I understand that it is a practice which is not much used, because hitherto such departments have usually carried passengers without payment. And, of course, carriage, other than for hire or reward is entirely outside the scope of operators' licensing and the rest of PSV law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision follows closely the previous Government's public service vehicle operators' qualifications. It exempts social service departments, which run minibuses, from complying with the requirement for professional competence and it seems to be a useful minor relaxation. I am not persuaded that we should seek a change and I resist the proposal that we should do so.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
I turn to amendment No. 150 in the names of the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras, South and Newcastle upon Tyne, Central. It adds the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or for the conveyance of schoolchildren".</p></blockquote>
The arguments have been well rehearsed in the Committee already. I entirely understand the concern that has been expressed by the hon. Gentlemen. I do not think there is any argument on the facts. It is a straight matter of judgment whether new requirements are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our position remains that set out by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary earlier. We believe that no problem has been thrown up by the present position. It has existed for a number of years and has not led to any difficulties over safety. There have been no problems related to the exercise of the law or the regulations. In the Transport Act 1978, the previous Government had the opportunity to change the regulations and, undoubtedly, they would have considered them and decided that that was unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view that local education authorities who run buses for schoolchildren are responsible bodies which, of course, seek to ensure the safety of those vehicles. It will probably not surprise the hon. Gentlemen but I must disappoint them on that amendment as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister's contribution slightly widens, rather than narrows, the argument. I accept his fair point that the previous Labour Government, in turning their attention to these matters, did not grasp and solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also take the hon. Gentleman's point that the facts and contentions involved in the arguments on amendments Nos. 171, 172 and 173 are reasonably clear. If I state them in a few sentences it might be helpful to the development of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19 divides public service vehicle operators' licences into a number of categories. The only two categories that we are concerned with for the purpose of the amendments and for the Minister's argument, are those of standard and restricted licences. We are concerned because if one can run with a restricted licence, one does not need to demonstrate to the traffic commissioner that one has any standard of professional competence. That is the underlying basis of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
It follows that the first judgment to make is whether it is important to ensure that those who run public services are professionally competent to do so. If it is it does not matter, there is no sense in this clause or the following one, but I am doing the Minister the courtesy of attributing to him the logic of approach which says that it is important. Otherwise, there would be little point in debating this part of the Bill. I assume, for the purposes of the argument, that there is some validity and some importance in ensuring that people who run certain forms of bus services are able to demonstrate their competence to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given those two premises—which I think are reasonable—there comes the question whether one can draw a line somewhere and say "Above that line it is important to have somebody who is professionally competent running the services. Below that line it is not important." That is always a difficult thing to do. I am not suggesting that if there is a dividing point it is easy to say exactly where it is. I am saying that one surely cannot find that dividing point by saying that it exists where the size of the operation being run is 50 per cent. of a man's business, or 49 per cent. or 51 per cent. For the purpose of the argument, I do not give a damn whether it is 99 per cent. or 1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether one needs to have the service run by somebody who can demonstrate his professional competence to run a service must be tested by criteria other than the percentage of his business that is devoted to running buses. For that reason I am not convinced by the Minister's defence for using that criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to a further point on subsection (4) and whether—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be clear what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. Subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>)(ii) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a person whose main occupation is not the operation of public service vehicles".</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman, if I understood him correctly, was talking about the proportion of the business. It is not the proportion, but the fact of whether it is the main business or not. There is no magic formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, in an endeavour to be brief, I was talking in shorthand in referring to 49 per cent. or 51 per cent. of an operator's business. If we say that it is a matter of fact whether it is his operation, it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1119</span>
could be contested. I do not accept that that would get us out of the difficulty. Someone might argue that it was not his main business. He might regard something else as being his main business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To shorten the argument, I am saying that I do not think that that is the right criterion. If we want logical criteria for dividing the restrictive from the full licence for the purpose of determining whether an operator reaches standards of professional competence, it cannot be done in that way. We must use a yardstick that relates to the safety of the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the two other points contained in the amendment. The first concerns whether or not the local or public authority should be exempted. That is a matter of judgment, but I should like it to be tested before an average bunch of citizens, if there is such a body, and see whether they consider that their local authority should be running passenger-carrying services if it has not taken the trouble to employ someone professionally competent to run them. The majority of citizens would take the simple view that I take. Public bodies should set an example to others and not be prepared to take advantage of the law to run services at lower standards. The law should not allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my right hon. Friend agree that it is in the interests of the safety of passengers that a local authority —more than anyone else—should employ someone competent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do agree. That is an important point and it flows from our earlier considerations. Many considerations apply, but if we give one primacy, it should be that of passenger safety. J expect public authorities to take the lead in that. I have been disappointed on more than one occasion, but nevertheless I still expect it. I remember the reaction of some public authorities to certain propositions in the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It was not exactly encouraging. Nevertheless, I think that the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is relevant. Public authorities should not be exempted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will agree—although he is entitled to change the Opposition's policy—that the provision follows closely the previous
	<span class='label label-info column'>1120</span>
Government's regulations, introduced in 1977. Although he is laying down a particular rule now, it is the opposite rule to that laid down by the Labour Government only three years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that I am putting forward an argument that could be used against legislation passed by a Labour Government. I prefaced my remarks by saying that that was so. There is nothing new in that. Incidentally, if the Minister wants to dwell on the point, and thinks that it is important that the spokesman for political parties in this House should follow the line of their predecessors, I hope he will reconsider his views on contract carriage. One of his predecessors took a very different line to that of his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who said that a proposition including legislation by one of his predecessors was the most unenforceable proposition he had ever seen. So it does not follow that what we are saying on either side of the Committee necessarily reflects the exact parallel judgment taken by our predecessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman cannot get away with that. In 1977 a Government decision was taken. It was not taken several years ago. What has changed and made the right hon. Gentleman, a member of that last Labour Government, come to an opposite conclusion to the then Secretary of State for Transport?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to go into the wider differences between the legislation of the Labour Government and that in the Bill, but I shall do so very broadly for the sake of answering the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the general movement in the Bill is away from licensing, making it easier for people to operate and placing fewer controls upon them. That is the general trend of the Bill. Within the context of a Bill which has that general trend, it is reasonable to take a different view of exemption on certain provisions than that which was taken in the context of a Bill which took a different view of licensing. That Bill followed the line that the overall judgment should be in favour of a greater degree of safeguard in respect of licensing provisions. That is the broad answer to the Minister's question. I admit that it warrants a much more detailed answer, but that would involve me going into details of other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1121</span>
I assert again that in the context of this Bill I cannot see the justification for exempting the local authorities, or the public authorities, from the requirement of showing professional competence to run their services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit worried about the line the right hon. Gentleman is pursuing. He is requiring that local authorities should be able to demonstrate that they have employees who can display professional competence, as required by EEC legislation. The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that in this sphere of transport, experience counts for a great deal more than academic qualifications. We now have this EEC requirement that one displays certain standards of professional competence which are not highly regarded in the industry as criteria. Is the right hon. Gentleman now saying that he places such weight upon these new EEC requirements that he wants local authorities to be inflicted with these requirements and employ people simply to meet them, instead of going along with the more practical conditions which he and I would have generally regarded as sensible in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The straight answer to the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) is "No". But I will give a fuller answer when I deal with the point on the EEC. I do not base my view on the need for a local authority to employ professionally competent people on any EEC consideration whatsoever. I shall give my view about the EEC access directive later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I base my view on a different issue altogether. I believe that local authorities can employ somebody who is professionally competent and, what is more, I do not think that we should be satisfied that the EEC directive guide on professional competence should be the one which we use in this country. I agree with the hon. Member for Faversham that some tests of competence may be of precious little value, and may not detect the kind of people we would wish to have running services. But that is an argument for dealing with the requirement of professional competence in another way so that one gets hold of the right people. The local authority should not have difficulty in recruiting somebody who is competent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>1122</span>
cannot ride away from the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) as easily as that. The only practical effect of what the right hon. Gentleman has said will be that the social service department which runs a minibus will be required to comply with professional competence requirements which, whether he likes it or not, are those laid down by the EEC. My hon. Friend's point is therefore absolutely valid. There is no wriggling away from it. Either the right hon. Gentleman accepts it or he does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to come to the question of the EEC directive in a wider context. However, as the Minister presses me on the narrow issue, the answer is "No". I still do not accept the point that he makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the way in which the EEC directive defines professional competence is a nonsense, Ministers responsible for negotiating these matters should return to the EEC and try to get a sensible definition on this matter. Nevertheless, I assume that within domestic legislation we could write our own definition of professional competence. Provided that it did not result in lower standards than those required by the EEC directive, we should still have workable legislation within the EEC framework. Not that I would wish to be curtailed by an EEC framework in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first main question about the effect of EEC directives was whether the clause was framed to take advantage of that. The Minister has now made it clear that it was indeed framed to obtain maximum advantage from the derogation that is available. That is nothing whatever to be proud of. Why should we take maximum advantage of a derogation under EEC legislation, if doing so will lead to services being operated by people who have not had to pass tests for competence of operation? That is the effect of pursuing the matter in this way. If the EEC had given any other directions on safety requirements, Ministers would not come along here boasting that they had taken advantage of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is contradicting himself. On the one hand, he says that the EEC directive is probably nonsense and we should go back and renegotiate it. On the other hand, he says that, even in its present nonsensical state, it should be applied in its full rigour to the whole transport system, or at least to all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
public service vehicles. Does that make any sense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if, in haste, I did not make the point clear. The interjection suggested that there was a weakness in the amendment which flowed from a dissatisfaction with the EEC standards or a judgment that they were not good standards by which to judge the professional competence of an operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reply was that there may be two ways open to us to deal with that problem. One is to try to negotiate within the EEC so that we have sensible EEC standards. The other is to examine the possibility of a separate domestic United Kingdom standard that will stand as being at least equal to, if not better than, the EEC standard. I realise that there is a difficulty in that. But that does not allow Conservative Members to evade the issue. If the EEC gives a derogation from anything that it has considered in the interests of public transport safety, it is not necessarily a matter in which to take pride if one then comes to this place and say that we should take maximum advantage of it. The EEC may give all kinds of derogations from general directives which are to be introduced in the interests of public safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the principle should be that competent people operate transport. It makes nonsense of the matter to hide behind EEC legislation. If that principle is agreed, one can argue about what level we shall have, and never mind the EEC.

	<p>forms of transport service. I suggest that the hon. Member for Faversham should turn his mind to to an amendment that would lay down a national standard for the test of competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we can agree on that issue of where one sets the level that each authority should be required to employ, at least we are agreed that at some standard of operation, at some size of vehicle and at some size of fleet there should be a test that includes a requirement of professional competence. At that point we still need a sensible definition, and I hope it would be one to which that the hon. Member for Faversham and I would both subscribe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no answer to our amendments to say that the definition of professional competence is unsatisfactory, that a Labour Government in the context of different legislation accepted the criterion of the division between those who required the operational competence test and those who did not, or that it is a matter of whether the bus operation is the major part of someone's business. I have explained my reasons for taking that view and I can only hope that the Minister will give the matter further consideration.</p>

The intention behind this amendment is to examine whether the operating centre is really suitable for the purpose which the Minister has outlined. By what he said earlier about the importance of linking the operator's licence to the operating centre for the vehicles, the Minister simplified my task considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition of this paragraph to subsection (3) is suggested in order to require the traffic commissioners, when considering an application for a public service vehicle operator's licence, to be satisfied that no difficulties connected with vehicle maintenance, for example, and thence safety or the comfort of passengers, or connected with road safety or public inconvenience, would be likely to arise from the use of the proposed operating centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst major well-equipped garages would clearly present no problems whatsoever, the reverse must also be true. The amendment implies that the operating centre should be well enough equipped to ensure that the vehicles that operate from it are properly maintained, safe, comfortable for the passengers and operated to proper road service standards, and that their operation does not cause any degree of public inconvenience. Unfortunately we</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided: Ayes 7, Noes 9</i></p>
	<p>have to discuss the amendment against the background of our knowledge that some bus operators do not maintain such centres. Some operate from premises which in no way resemble the Minister's description of what a bus operating centre should be. Unless we make clear in the Bill the standard that we want centres to attain, people could operate from car parks, lay-bys or even the verges of the highway. I know of difficulties that are experienced by people as a result of certain operators doing that. I am talking both of passenger transport and freight. I therefore greatly welcome what the Minister said about his view of the significance of the centre. I accept his justification for imposing the regional tests, for presumably the regional commissioners will be more likely to know whether the centre in their own region complies with the standards, and I look forward to his accepting the amendment.</p>
	<p>3.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the implications of the right hon. Gentleman's amendment. He is right in saying that at present many operators, even under the present regulations, operate without premises. They can operate from car parks or from lay-bys, and in some cases this can present problems such as those that he outlined. It could affect car-park use by other people, and it could affect road safety. At the moment it is not regarded as sufficient reason for preventing an operator from carrying on his business—not, at least, by the traffic commissioners, although perhaps in some cases it could be the basis of action by the local authority on planning grounds.

I do not wish to stray too far on this amendment, but it gives an opportunity to raise the general question of suitability of premises as operating centres. In consider-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1127</span>
ing a more relaxed licensing system, one hears concern expressed about the possibility of new operators coming who will be even less scrupulous in their practices than existing operators. I well understand those fears, and I believe that we should give proper consideration to the concern that undesirable elements might come in on a greater scale. I looked at the Bill, therefore, to see how those concerns would be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the requirement in subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>)
	<br><blockquote><p>"that there will be adequate facilities or arrangements for maintaining in a fit and serviceable condition the vehicles proposed to be used under the licence"</p></blockquote>
is not an obligation to have premises of their own. It is simply a requirement that there should be somewhere where the vehicles can be serviced and maintained, and that could be any nearby garage, with which there need be no commercial relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operating centre, as I read the Bill, is merely the address from which the operator is to operate. That is required primarily so as to have a geographical location to decide in which traffic commissioners' area he operates and to whom he has to apply for a licence. One pursues the logic of the right hon. Gentelman's amendment if one says that the traffic commissioner has to decide whether the operating centre is "suitable". If it is a small operator, it could be quite suitable for a person with one vehicle or two vehicles to operate from a car park. There is nothing unsuitable about that unless it is proven that it is a danger to other road users. I do not see that the amendment would inhibit the small operator from operating from very informal locations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there comes a point at which it is quite unsuitable for a large operator to operate from informal surroundings such as that. It would be undesirable if we introduced amendments that made it hard for the small, one-man business—the man with one vehicle or the part-time operator —to operate and to offer an informal, competitive service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's amendment is not as restrictive as I first expected, but it raises the general question on which I should appreciate some comments from my right hon. Friend about the relevance and importance of having premises for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>
holders of public service vehicle operator's licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. I believe there is a ruling that Members should not smoke or read newspapers during the proceedings of a Committee. But the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) has been reading his newspaper for some time. Will you draw the Committee's attention to the rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in order to read newspapers or any material unless it is relevant to the matter under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friends were simply scanning the papers to see whether there were any reports of the proceedings of this Committee in the 	<i>Daily Mail</i> and 	<i>The Sun</i>—probably without success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the general point put by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). Neither the Government nor the Ministry of Transport want to introduce yet new methods of bureaucracy for checking a new requirement. I should point out that we are not certain that the amendment, as drafted, would achieve the aim which the right hon. Gentleman hopes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a strong environmental concern regarding the place where heavy vehicles—either heavy goods vehicles or buses—are based. Different conditions obviously apply to heavy goods vehicles. But the Foster report concludes that one of the objectives of operators' licensing should be to help protect the environment from heavy goods vehicles. The report accordingly recommends a limited extension of environmental objectives, particularly in regard to the suitability of the operating centre. Any action in that regard must await the outcome of the Armitage inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has never been the same environmental concern or control on bus stations in the PSV licensing system. Frankly, there has been little pressure for it. We should need to be convinced that such was necessary. I prefer not to extend the jurisdiction of commissioners into planning, but to leave the matter to local authorities which have the necessary professional support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with care to the right hon. Gentleman. I offer, without commitment, to look at the position to see whether there is any way in which we can help him to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1129</span>
achieve his objective, with or without amending the Bill. I make that offer to the right hon. Gentleman. He may feel that it is sufficient to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the Minister's response. Clearly, he appreciates that the amendment addresses itself to what could be a real problem, and that it is serious in that it relates to a part of the Bill which has to operate effectively if the Bill is to achieve the wider facilities of clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read clause 20, the commissioners, in granting operators' licences or even in deciding on the duration of the licences, must have regard to a number of matters, including adequate maintenance facilities, arrangements for complying with the laws of vehicle operation, driving and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) was a fair one. All that I seek to do through the amendment is to make sure that the centre is adequate for the purposes of the Bill. I believe that the hon. Gentleman was also right in suggesting that when a commissioner would have regard to whether he was looking at the premises of someone who was running a single vehicle or a fleet of 2,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we would rely on the commissioner's judgment for the effectiveness of the operation, but we have to do that in so many other areas of the Bill that I shall not be unduly worried. It could at least convey to applicants and those concerned in other ways with operators' licences that they will have to show that they have some arrangements and ability to command the facilities that they need to carry out the duties as operators laid upon them by an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to make those duties unduly onerous or duties that go one whit further than what is necessary to meet the broad aims agreed across the Committee. If I tried to do that, I should have little chance of succeeding at this stage. But in light of what was said by the Minister and subject to the understanding that we are seeking to have operators assuring commissioners that they will arrange facilities which will allow them to operate in the way required by the Act—I take it that the Minister's nod signifies that—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 19, line 40, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing that the application for the grant of a new licence has been submitted at least six calendar months before the expiry date of the existing licence or such other time as the Minister may require by regulation.".</p></blockquote>
I will be brief. The amendment may be described as a lengthy and probing amendment. It seemed to me and my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central that under the clause, a licence holder with a licence that is limited to five years could apply for a renewal of his licence a day before it expired, and in the knowledge that such matters take a long time to be considered, he could, in effect, extend the period of his licence by that process and continue to do so as a regular course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to try to discover from the Minister whether there is any protection in the Bill against that sort of approach by an operator. If there is not, we shall wish the amendment to be accepted and no longer considered as probing, because we do not believe it appropriate for the law to be left unamended if it could be exploited in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is severely to restrict the provision in the Bill allowing operator licences to continue after the expiry date, provided that an application for a new licence has been made. The amendment puts the onus on the operator to apply for renewal six months in advance of expiry or such other time as the Minister may require by regulation. That is the purpose and the effect of what is being sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view a six months' period of notice is excessive. I stick to the view that it is not necessary to have a statutory period of notice for renewals. I do not imagine that the extension of the licence period will often amount to more than a week or two and it will not prejudice the traffic commissioners' power to suspend or revoke a licence in the interim period.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment, because we think it is appropriate. I do not find acceptable the idea that the process might drag on for a week or so. At other points in the discussion of the Bill it seemed to me to have been a common cause between both sides of the Committee that the traffic commissioners frequently spend months considering various applications.

	<p>running on the basis of a five-year licence should not, one week before the licence runs out, slap in an application and seek to use the provisions of the clause. In the shorter licensing periods there may be some case for the Minister's view, but anybody operating on a five-year licence application should be encouraged to put in his application earlier in order to avoid running into these difficulties.</p>
	<p>The six month's period sought by my hon. Friend should be sufficient to allow the commissioners to clear the application, and therefore the operator should have a continuous licence. At least the applicant would be on sound ground, if a commissioner had not dealt with his application within that time, to continue under the provisions of the clause. When an operator has been in business for five years, failure to make an application until the last minute would suggest that he was not as well organised as we might wish.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>the idea of such restrictions to the whole concept of regulation by road service licences for operations below the threshold of deregulation. I shall not introduce the complications revealed by our discussion on the effect in trial areas. The point is narrow, but important.</p>
	<p>If one wishes to see the points of picking up and setting down passengers within the road service licence system controlled on conditions of licences, that is appropriate to the consideration of the road service licence. The additional complication of overlapping or duplicate provisions attached to the operators' licence is nonsensical. I shall be interested to hear a Minister who has been arguing that we should simplify the requirements that the law places on operators defend the existence of clause 21(4).</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment is to leave out subsection (4), which removes from the Bill the explicit power for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1133</span>
the Minister to prescribe conditions which the traffic commissioners may attach to operators' licences regulating the places at which vehicles used under an operator's licence may stop to take up or set down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection is basically intended as a reserve power. Some disquiet has been expressed about the effect on traffic management of the delicensing of longdistance services, including excursions and tours, and the liberalisation of short-distance excursions and tours which do not compete with stage carriage services. At present the stopping places of such services are controlled by conditions on the licences. It is feared that decontrol will seriously increase congestion in some places. Such allegations are most frequently made by the opponents of decontrol; but some county councils and the Metropolitan Police have also expressed fears. It is impossible at this stage to say whether they are well founded or not. It is relevant that in many popular tourist spots, licensed services are greatly outnumbered by contract carriages, or coaches carrying parties of foreign tourists, whose stopping places have never been subject to licensing control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection itself is a precautionary measure. It is designed to meet the argument that the relaxation in the Bill will lead to traffic management problems. Personally I am sure that there will be no general problem. Even in the most popular spots the coaches which are now controlled and will no longer be so are far outnumbered by private hire vehicles and vehicles carrying foreign tourists, which have never been controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I decided—the right hon. Gentleman's point was perfectly fair—that a reserve power to control stopping places would be very useful. It would only be activated if necessary, and there would be full discussion with local authorities. The traffic commissioners' discretion will be limited by regulations. Controls will relate to localities, not to particular operators, and the standard conditions on all licences for operators running services to a specific place will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to reassure the right hon. Gentleman on that point. I particularly stress that here we are only taking to ourselves a reserve power as a precautionary measure. In the context of the Bill that is a sensible thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
taking the amendments together, I wish to refer to amendment No. 186 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). It may seem a little odd in that it suddenly introduces the idea of provision for the disabled into a clause that does not in general relate to the disabled. Nevertheless, the disabled are still getting a bad deal. For example, in this House we fail by 50 per cent. to reach the prescribed 3 per cent. of disabled staff. I do not think that too much prominence can be given to the rights and needs of the disabled and the duties that need to be imposed on other people so that the disabled can cope with their problems. To be disabled should not be to be disadvantaged by that physical disability. I contend that such provision is appropriate at this point. This part of the Bill picks out stops as one of the conditions that may be prescribed. Consequently stops for the disabled should be included so that proper prominence is given to their needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies to my hon. Friend, may I press him a little further on the first amendment? Does the Minister regard as insufficient the general power that the Bill would give to local authorities to make conditions relating to the stopping of vehicles? In an earlier debate we established that that power was intended to cover express carriage operations. Does the Minister wish to retain a fall-back position so that conditions could also be attached to the operator's licence? If that is so, I take it that they would be strictly additional and in no way give rights to the operator to stop in breach of any conditions imposed by local authorities. If that were so, it would seem a total nonsense. So I am asking, there is to be a general provision as regards express carriage operations, that the local authorities should be able to make regulations to limit the waiting of the express carriage. In addition, however, there is the fall-back provision which can be operated by regulation if the Minister so desires. It would put the further restriction on the stopping places of the express carriage vehicles through the operation of the traffic commissioner upon the operator's licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The straight answer to the right hon. Gentleman's last point is "Yes". That is the position and is what the Government intend to do. Basically, that would

As to amendment No. 186 I have spoken before on the situation of the disabled, and my aim and determination to seek to do something in that sphere. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he is pursuing that point, and it is one that the Government will seek to respond to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the motives behind the amendment but have to tell the hon. Gentleman that I think that a reference to the disabled is not appropriate in this clause. It is a reserve power for traffic management. It will be general and will not be related to specific operators. No opportunities for representations or road service licence conditions will exist.

	<p>consider our suggestion that the fine for this offence should be higher than that for simply not publishing? This offence is serious and if the fine is to act as a deterrent it seems nonsensical to have the same fine for both offences.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained the general philosophy behind the method by which we are seeking to set maximum penalties. I should have thought that there is general agreement in the Committee that consistency between different offences and seeking to get similar offences grouped in the same sort of fine maxima is sensible policy to pursue. Probably it is common ground on both sides of the Committee that one should try to avoid obvious absurdities between offences and in the way that penalties are applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to increase the maximum penalty for contravening conditions on operators' licences. The penalty in the Bill is £200—the same as for contravening conditions on road service licensing. It can be argued that there is no reason to have a higher penalty for contravening conditions on operators' licensing than for doing so on road service licensing. However, it can also be argued that, in the latter situation, the offence is intrinsically
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1137</span>
more serious, because the vehicle being used could be a danger or potential danger to the public. That is probably the point which hon. Gentlemen are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next penalty on the scale is £500. I cannot commit myself on that at this stage. I am prepared to consider whether a higher penalty would be appropriate. A special case can be made and that is why hon. Gentlemen have sought a separate debate on the offence. If they will allow me time for consultation, I shall undertake to consider it, although I cannot commit my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hour is late and I sense an impatience to terminate our proceedings. I shall, therefore, restrict myself to a couple of points on a clause which is principally concerned with the attachment of conditions to operators' licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of conditions that a commissioner might consider appropriate should reflect to some extent the way in which the operator conducts himself. The clause must be seen as a long-stop for the failure of the previous clause. Provided the operator is of good repute, with the right financial standing, fulfils professional competence standards and has the maintenance facilities to see that the vehicles are in good order and in all respects comply with the law, it is hardly likely that many conditions will have to be attached to his licence to achieve the objectives of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That might easily be illustrated by the part of the clause that gives power to the commissioner to lay down the maximum number of vehicles that can be operated. Obviously the commissioner will look at the operator's ability to handle that number of vehicles, the maintenance facilities, and so on. He will have the power to say "You can operate so many of that type of vehicle and so many of that type; so
	<span class='label label-info column'>1138</span>
many double-deckers so many single-deckers, so many 40-seaters and so many 20-seaters". That must relate to the operator's facilities and his proven competence. There is a relationship between the clause and the preceding one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only other point on the clause is that, like so many clauses that we have so far debated, one cannot really test its effect by reading it, because it depends on a statutory instrument yet to be made which, in this case, will prescribe the conditions that may be imposed. Therefore, we have debated a clause concerned with imposing conditions without knowing what conditions may be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the difficulties under which we labour as long as the Act is constructed in such a way as to leave so many important changes to statutory instruments. I should welcome the Minister's comments on that and I hope that in order to facilitate our having better debates when we deal with clauses the effects of which depend upon the laying of a statutory instrument, he can give us some guidance as to the broad lines of the statutory instrument which he would intend to introduce, given that he gets the clause in the from in which he proposes it and given that the Bill becomes an Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides for conditions to be attached to operators' licences. There must be a condition limiting the number of vehicles that may be used under a licence, because, as the hon. Gentleman said, the maintenance facilities of the operator would be suitable only for a finite number of vehicles. In addition, the nature of those facilities may limit the number of double-deckers or articulated vehicles, for example, that could be dealt with, so commissioners have discretion to specify the maximum number of different kinds of vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the conditions foreseen in subsections (1) and (2). Clearly these are consequential on a change to an operator-based system. Such conditions are not needed under the present system, because each licence covers only one specific vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also thought it prudent to provide for other sorts of conditions to be added relating to the use made of vehicles under the licence, but this is not to be a substitute for road service licensing itself. We do not intend conditions to be set, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1139</span>
example, limiting the operator to using only so many vehicles on express services.
