	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 277, in page 32, line 40, leave out "subject to subsection (4)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 284, in page 33, line 10, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. May I ask the Minister whether he agrees that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if, before debating this clause, we had access to the proposed draft of the articles of association for the successor company to which the assets of the National Freight Corporation are to be transferred? Does the Minister intend to make these articles available to the House by putting them in the Library or by giving a copy to each member of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I think the hon. Gentleman knows that that is a misuse of the points of order procedure. The hon. Gentleman could put that question during the course of his speech on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This side of the Committee takes the view that the part II of the Bill represents a rip-off of public assets to the benefit of private investors. We are disturbed at the prospect of public assets being squandered for private gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point on the clause is that subsection (4), to which these amendments refer, is a vital part of the rip-off process. Part II could therefore be described as a three-part rip-off. We have the write-off rip-off, the sell-off rip-off and the strip-off rip-off. Subsection (4) is the first of those rip-offs—the write-off rip-off. It covers the writing off of the commencing capital debt of the National Freight Corporation which,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1542</span>
I believe, totals £58.7 million, and outstanding loans to the Government of £41.3 million. If my arithmetic is right that is a total of £100 million to be written off by the Government. That represents either a capital sum of £100 million or, as near as can be, £8 million in annual payments to the Government which will be written off at the taxpayers' expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Government consider the write off to be necessary? The answer is that it will make the National Freight Corporation a more attractive purchase. I can do no better than briefly quote what the Parliamentary Secretary said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the immediate effects of our proposals is that the company's capital structure will be very much more attractive".</p></blockquote>
Indeed it will. It would be much more attractive to buy shares in the new National Freight Company—if that is what it will be—when the company does not have a £100 million debt to the Government than if that debt were to remain as it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather strange that a Government who say that they are dedicated to cutting public expenditure will, through this subsection, in effect spend £100 million of capital, or forgo—which is another way of spending—£8 million a year in income. It is interesting that such a sum has never been written off before. I understand that such an amount could have previously been written off to the benefit of the National Freight Corporation, but that did not happen largely because of the malignant effects of the Treasury during the period of the Labour Government. I cannot establish the motives that prevented such a write-off under previous Conservative Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, no private purchasers or property speculators on the make would have gained if it had been written off while the company remained in public control. The proposal is attractive only to those who want cowboy operators to move into National Freight or want to benefit possible private purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Minister of Transport stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the NFC has not had the commercial freedom and opportunities open to private firms".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, cc. 1128–1242.]</p></blockquote>
It certainly did not have that. Few private firms have had a regular and invariable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1543</span>
demand for £8 million a year to be paid to the Government. But either that has not registered with the Minister or he does not give much weight to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is supposed to be necessary so that the capital structure will be attractive and the NFC will have more freedom and opportunity than before. I do not understand why that is necessary, because in a debate on the NFC's commencing capital debt order in 1976 the present Minister of Transport said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the NFC is not run as some vast over-centralised nationalised industry. The corporation is broken down into a federated structure … maximum independence is given to the separate companies … the management in the NFC seems genuinely in no way to wish to avoid commercial realities. The Opposite is the case. The approach of the corporation is … to achieve a commercially viable company, to invest in success and to disinvest in failure … we urge that the NFC should pay its way … are, we believe, pushing against an open door … because that represents the aspirations not only of the top management but of the staff".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 May 1976; Vol. 911, cc. 587–8.]</p></blockquote>
Nevertheless, he did not feel obliged at that time to advocate that the freedom to pursue the better commercial interests of the company would in any way be assisted by writing off its capital debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only now, when it is necessary to make the company more attractive to potential private purchasers, that Conservative Members feel it appropriate to write off the capital debt and, in effect, to give away £100 million. That seems a most bizarre approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether the £100 million in expenditure—that is what it is—will be counted by the Treasury as part of the public expenditure on transport for which he and the Minister are responsible. Will the transport industries be deprived of £8 million a year for many years, or £100 million in the forthcoming year, because of the write-off? It seems to me that the Treasury, if it takes its usual barmy view of public expenditure, would be justified in saying that. The measure represents public expenditure by the Department of Transport. If one had to assess all the possible ways of spending money on Britain's transport industry at present, the lowest priority one could conceive would be writing off the debt of the National Freight Corporation in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1544</span>
order to make it more attractive to private purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will claim that such action is justified even in financial terms because the £100 million debt and the £8 million per year income will be exchanged for the securities that are to be issued when the assets are sold off to the private sector. However, we do not know the terms. I suspect that the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and their officials do not yet have any idea of the terms on which the securities are to be disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now being asked to agree to the writing-off of £100 million without knowing what we are to get in return. Yet to examine such details is a vital part of the function of Members of Parliament. £100 million will certainly go out of the window but we simply do not know what will come through the door in exchange for it. Is the Minister prepared to tell us the terms on which the shares or other securities in the new company will be disposed of? If not, it would be a gross dereliction of the duty of all members of the Committee to perform their traditional role of controlling the Executive, of controlling public expenditure and of limiting the extra-parliamentary discretion of Ministers if they allow the proposal to go through. I am quite serious about that; it is not just a debating point. If the measure goes through as proposed, £100 million will be written off and—for all we know at the moment—the public may receive in income from the securities sold as little as threepence. They may get £100 million or £500 million. But there is no guarantee that they will get anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore the measure before us is not good enough. It would be appropriate for even the Conservative Back-Bench Members—if they are paying any attention to what they are being asked to approve—to demand that the Committee and the House are told what the public will get in exchange for the write-off. It is entirely inappropriate to leave the question of what is to come in entirely to the discretion of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later we shall discuss other amendments that seek to limit that discretion. On this part of the Bill we do not really expect any accommodation from the Parliamentary Secretary on such issues. It may well be necessary for us to make efforts to limit the Minister's discretion under other parts of the clause and under later clauses in this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1545</span>
We are being expected to give the Minister a free hand in the matter of the £100 million that is to be written off. I cannot imagine that that is acceptable to anyone who approaches in a responsible manner Parliament's role in controlling the actions of the Executive and in particular what it does with taxpayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will consider the matter further. We shall have another famous period of reflection—I do not expect anything to happen today—and I hope that Back-Bench Members in particular will bring pressure to bear so that the Minister is not given carte blanche. I hope that they will go even further and identify the £100 million of additional public expenditure that they are being asked to sanction, recognise that it is of the lowest possible priority and consequently bring pressure on the Minister to withdraw part II. That would save a great many jobs, the industrial side of the National Freight Corporation and also a great deal of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a critically important amendment because it goes to the heart of the clause. It goes almost to the heart of the Government's central proposition in this part of the Bill. There is a certain irony in it because if the propaganda that one reads in the newspapers and other political material is to be believed, the Conservative Party stands for two things: the control of public expenditure and the protection of taxpayers' money. In this debate the roles will be reversed, because the amendment demonstrates that the Labour side of the Committee is concerned about the public borrowing requirement and taxpayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposition contained in subsection (4) is astonishing. The argument surrounding the amendment is central to the Government's proposition. It concerns the change of a public corporation, highly geared with fixed interest commitments, to a concern under the Companies Act, Limited by shares, with equity capital, where dividends are paid according to the prosperity or otherwise of market conditions. The National Freight Corporation is to be transferred to a successor company, limited by shares. The key issue will arise when the shares come to be sold. We are debating how, and under what conditions, the shares are to be put on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1546</span>
market. We are arguing about the prospectus that will be put forward to the public when the shares are sold. We do not know in what proportion they will be sold. We do not know whether the Minister aims to keep the structure as it is, or whether all the shares will be sold and the new successor company come under entirely new management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many vague areas, but the one that is not vague is that public money is to be used for the sale of shares to the private sector. That is an astonishing proposition that I did not think would come from a Conservative Government. If the amendment is not passed, it will be evident in terms of principle that the Government are willing to sacrifice the interest and money of the taxpayer in order to make a sale to the private sector. That is not only astonishing, but a disgrace. After all the talk about protecting taxpayers' money and giving the man in the street a good deal for the money that he has paid over the years, this is totally a monstrous proposition. The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister should take it out of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there are many indeterminate areas in the clause on which we shall have to question the Parliamentary Secretary and, subsequently, the Minister, it is clear that public money is being used as a bait on the hook for the sale of these shares to the public. Subsection (4) proposes that
	<ol>
	<li>the commencing capital debt of the Corporation; and</li>
	<li>outstanding loans to the Corporation from the Minister shall be extinguished immediately before the appointed day.</li></ol>
In other words, he is putting this in the shop window, but giving it a lot of window dressing in that he is axing the debt from it before doing so. We cannot accept that proposition under any circumstances. In order to sell the NFC off, the Government are quite blatantly to use taxpayers' money to dress up the shop window. That is disgraceful. The Minister is giving the piranha fish a field day anyway, without putting jam on it in the form of extinguishing the debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to my hon. Friend that putting caviar on it would be more appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what piranha fish eat these days—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are arguing in terms of the principle of public ownership and trans-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1547</span>
ferring it to the private sector and so on, I would not have said that the NFC should be regarded as one of the enormous commanding heights of the economy, important though it is. But such is the extent of Conservative dogma that not only are they transferring ownership, they are using public money to do so. Therefore we must ask whether the NFC, which the Minister has praised many times, gives rise to such repugnance in his mind that he has to go to these lengths in order to sell the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, the Minister will wait until market conditions are right before selling the shares, but it does not give much cause for optimism for the future of the sale of the National Freight Corporation when he has to extinguish £100 million of debt before putting the corporation on the market. We are being asked to underwrite the use—or, I should say, the misuse—of public money, and that is a blatant disregard for financial wisdom and prudence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to the hon. Gentleman that the Government are making a most sensible proposal, because if the corporation's shares were offered on the basis that there was a large debt to the Government, the price to be gained would be considerably less and the public worse off in terms of the finance that would be raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very convoluted form of reasoning. If one sells something, one does not use public money to make it more attractive. When one buys something in the market place, one takes it with the good and the bad. That is a normal commercial proposition. People who set out to buy anything must weigh in terms of commercial wisdom the good and bad sides of what they purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Minister are saying that they are not quite sure about the sale or about the wisdom of it. If they were, there would not be such vague terminology in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hazard a guess that the proposal to write off £100 million has been suggested to the Government by the broker who is to market the shares. I understand that the merchant bank of Schroder is advising the Government on the marketing, so it is quite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1548</span>
evident that the City is getting a piece of the action before we start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the spin off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, there may be a spin-off effect. I am reminded of Bismarck's saying that however honest a broker you are, you always act for a large commission. That is precisely what we are seeing within the terms of the clause and the amendment. If we on the Labour side do not point that out, the British taxpayer will be taken for a very fast ride under the terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment says, in effect, that if the National Freight Corporation is to be sold, it should be sold as it stands with its liabilities as well as its assets. That is the only approach that is fair to the taxpayer. I appeal to Government Members, paragons as they are in defence of taxpayers' money, to reconsider that matter. The most dangerous stage in political life and the most dangerous pitch to which one can ever rise is when one believes one's own propaganda. When one starts that, one is going down the slippery slope. The Government have begun to believe their own propaganda about saving public money, but the clause, the amendment and subsection (4) belie that whole principle, because when the chips are down—as they are now—they are willing to use public money for a purpose, that, if revealed to the public, the public would not agree with. The buyer must exercise a commercial judgment whether the NFC is worth buying with the books as they are at present, not as the Government dress them up to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that gives me hope—and hope springs eternal—is that when these swashbuckling private enterprise people come in to buy the shares of the NFC, being men of such yeoman good sense and financial independence, they will not want the public subsidy. I am sure that they will turn it down because they are of the political frame of mind that does not want public subsidy. They will tell the Government to take it back and in that way we might even save our money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a last point. How much taxpayers' money we shall recover from the sale of shares, even when the commencing commercial debt and the loans are written off, remains a complete mystery. The shares will have to be marketed at the right time, in the right way and at the right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1549</span>
price. We know none of those matters, so no one knows how much of our £100 million will be recovered. That is a complete leap in the dark. One may be in favour of a leap in the dark now and again, but not when it is financed with £100 million of taxpayers' money as this is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, even when we get the money back from the sale of the shares, deducted from that amount will be the historical pensions obligations which have to be funded. So we shall not get anything like all of the money back anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the amendment seeks to achieve a number of objectives. The first is justice to the taxpayer. If the amendment is not passed, this will cost him tens of millions of pounds. Secondly, the amendment makes true costs, financial obligations, commercial information and commercial truth—that is the point—part of the framework of the sale. The Opposition's third objective in the amendment is to expose what in the end is blatant political sharp practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends live in eternal hope. I do not share that hope. If anything in the Bill clearly divides the Committee, it is this part. It is blatant robbery—highway robbery, to put it in transport terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look at this in the context of the time at which it is being done. On the one hand, local authorities and services to the public are being cut to the bone by a policy of monetary madness. Yet these watchers of the public purse can at the same time give away £100 million when it suits them. That was the figure mentioned by my hon Friends, but I dispute that. We are actually being asked to sign a blank cheque. All the figures that have been quoted are current, but we do not know the appointed day. To go from the sublime to the ridiculous, it may be 10 years' hence. The Bill provides that the current debts are to be written off
	<br><blockquote><p>"immediately before the appointed day".</p></blockquote>
So we do not know whether the figure will be £100 million, £105 million or any other sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite sure that this proposal was discussed with brokers before being put into the Bill. The Government are not writing off the debts of any other nationalised industries. The reason for their action is clear. The brokers no doubt said to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1550</span>
Government, "You may have a chance of selling the shares in National Freight, but with this amount of debt you have no chance."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition must demonstrate to the public exactly what is going on. What happens if none of the shares are sold? The Conservatives' indignation was remarkable when we tried to help National Freight at the time of the 1978 Bill. We now see yet another conversion. But they are converted only when it suits them and that must be clearly shown. Without a shadow of doubt, this is blatant robbery and misuse of the public purse. It is the Opposition's duty to demonstrate not just to the Committee but to people outside exactly what is happening. The Government are happy to make cuts in the local sector which affect the public. Yet they give away £100 million to their friends who may buy the NFC shares. The real nature of the policies being pursued by the Government must therefore be constantly exposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister intervenes to answer some of the questions raised by my hon. Friends, I should like to pose some others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment raises fundamental questions. It will be helpful to have answers to those questions before proceeding to other parts of the clause. It raises the question of whether there should be total extinguishment of the capital debt of the corporation and of the outstanding loans made to the corporation by the Minister before the assets of the National Freight Corporation are transferred to a Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to question whether that is practical in reality. I accept that it can be done as a book-keeping operation but I question whether the proposition contained in the Bill can, in common sense, be achieved. In order to achieve it one would have to sell the shares that are to replace the loans and debts before the company exists. Subsection (4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"immediately before the appointed day".</p></blockquote>
Presumably, that means that the debts will be extinguished at the eleventh hour and fifty-fifth minute of the day before the day appointed. We know that the debts represent a public shareholding in a tangible, well-organised, public asset. They are shares that were sold to the British public who are the owners of the NFC

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1551</span>
and its subsidiaries. They are the public's tangible interest in a highly efficient, reputable, well-organised and developing organisation in the freight industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand one of my hon. Friends saying that that is not a commanding height of the economy, but it is the only part of that sector of our economy that is in public hands. It has been attempting by commercial criteria, of which the Minister would approve, to do a first-class job of developing in that area under all the limitations that my hon. Friends have described. How can the Government extinguish what is in reality a holding in a series of assets, before they have a company to which it can be transferred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is described in the clause must be a book-keeping operation and we have to scrutinise how that book-keeping can be done. It seems that the only way in which one could begin to approach what the Minister is aiming at in subsection (4) is for the shares to be in existence before the appointed day. They should be put into somebody's hands, either to retain them or to transfer them in advance of the appointed day to those whom he will nominate and who will represent the company. That is not what the Bill provides, but it seems to be the only practical way of proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who, at the point immediately before midnight—it could be 50 seconds to midnight—on the day before the appointed day will own the shares? On the appointed day, can the Minister retain the shares? Will he retain some of the shares until they are sold, or will they be in the hands of those whom he has nominated or appointed to be responsible for the company coming into existence on the appointed day? Those assets must be owned by someone. As they are the assets of the British public, and one of our roles is to protect the British public's assets, we must have an answer from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a book-keeping operation that extinguishes, before the appointted day, that capital debt, we shall be extinguishing a public shareholding. There must be something in our legislation that represents the holding of those assets. Presumably the Minister wants to exchange the documents representing ownership of the assets for some shares that can be sold on the market. The Minister has not made clear—and the Bill certainly does not make clear—whether it is intended that the whole, or just part, of the shares should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1552</span>
put on the market immediately. That is an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister intends to retain—or at least to have the right to retain; the Bill seems to give that right—part of the shares and to sell the other part, we need to know when the transfer takes place. In other words, will the shares still held by the Minister represent the public's remaining interest in the assets of the National Freight Corporation? Surely that must be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By midnight on the relevant day the Minister may have come to an arrangement for those he has nominated to take a nominal number of shares so that they can be the company's representatives from then on. Let us assume that 10 or 12 people will have agreed, in respect of the transfer of assets, to buy as many shares as necessary to enable them, within the definition of Companies Act responsibilities on those who run companies, to take over the running of the company. Surely the Minister will be in possession of the other shares on behalf of the public?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, at that point there will have been no transfer—it will be an illusion. It is a beautiful piece of parliamentary draftsmanship that represents nothing in reality. The Minister is merely holding shares in the company, instead of the capital debt and loans on behalf of the public. We are talking about a process of transfer that does not take place immediately at all, and about an extinguishment that is not an extinguishment of a public holding at the relevant time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the extinguishment can occur afterwards. It may be that in the subsequent sale of the shares the public's right to obtain payment on the loan and debt will be exchanged for a sum that cannot be calculated at present. Will the Minister confirm that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman keeps making points in an inquiring sort of way. It may help if I tell him that he is absolutely right. All that we are talking about is the day on which the Government's financial interest will be changed from fixed-interest capital debt into securities, but there will be no transfer of ownership because all the securities will be owned by the Minister or his nominees on behalf of the public. As the right hon. Gentleman has discovered that fact from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1553</span>
examining the clause, perhaps he could explain to his hon. Friends that they are becoming rather excited about nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all, because the Parliamentary Secretary has underlined one of my hon. Friends' concerns, which I certainly share. If what will happen in reality is not what the Bill states, we are talking about a process of transfer of public assets into private hands on terms that are not accurately described and do not correspond with what the Minister intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends are right to say that they do not know what the public will receive. Clearly, they cannot know, in view of how the Bill is framed, what the public will have in exchange for public assets at the time of the transfer. The Minister has helpfully confirmed that the transfer of the assets from public to private hands will not take place immediately, but he has not said how much of a transfer would have to take place immediately for someone else to be in a legal position to run the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume, from the limited knowledge of the Companies Act which I have had to acquire for the purpose of dealing with this Bill, that in order for the company to be run someone will have to take over part of the assets at the point of transfer. Otherwise the company will be run by people who have no assets or holding in it. That would be another strange creation, in addition to the strange creations already in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of the company at any stage having no owners. Subsection (5)(6) gives the answer. The company that will be set up on the appointed day to take over the assets of the corporation will have all its issued shares held by the Minister or by nominees for him. The owner will be the Minister or his nominees, on behalf of the public. Thereafter, as the right hon. Gentleman says, at some unspecified date chosen by the Government those shares can be sold to private owners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that is a com-monsense reading of subsection (5), but that merely underlines my point. The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that he envisages the creation of a company in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1554</span>
which it is possible, within the terms of the Bill, for none of the directors to have any shares in that company. It is possible for the Minister to hold all the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of a company are we talking about? We shall have a company which is wholly publicly owned—namely, with the essential characteristics of the present NFC—but which has a legal potential for transfer, backed by legislation which enables transfers to take place to people within the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must make clear whether that is what he is talking about. If so, in subsection (5) we are dealing with something that is a complete illusion and is not connected with reality. The Parliamentary Secretary has helpfully confirmed that these two subsections permit a company which is wholly publicly owned, until some shares are sold at a later date, to be transferred to persons other than the Minister at a time after the public shares as I call them—the capital debt and the loans—have been held by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, a most incredible situation. We have a Bill which does not correspond to the reality of the Government's intention and creates a wonderful illusion of extinguishing public rights. It is an illusion in that sense, but not in another with which we shall have to deal in a later amendment, because the money earned by the public holding may cease to be available to the public. That is a serious point which justifies the term "rip-off" used by my hon Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, engaged in a dangerous charade of examining in detail, a clause in the Bill which does not correspond to the reality of the Government's intentions or, if the Government get their way, what they will cause to happen. We are creating a sort of organisation which, as far as I can ascertain, has never before been created in this country. It is a type of mutation. It is a fully publicly owned corporation which is somehow to be transferred, with an indefinable timetable and indefinable terms of ownership, into a private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is as though we were being asked to envisage something that normally happens only in pantomime or fairy tales, when a wand is waved and a prince turns into a frog, or as the Bill is probably seen on the Government side, a frog turns into a prince. I do not know whether our role is that of the wizard or the wicked witch,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1555</span>
but apparently we are supposed to be providing the wand in the form of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a role which I would normally want to see ascribed to Parliament or legislation. It is the Committee's duty to find out how far that wand will be charged with magical properties. Therefore, I want to raise the point on the amendment that you have indicated, Mr. English, will be in order. Clearly its ramifications go much wider into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When are we to see the memorandum and articles of association proposed for the company? I take it that your point of guidance, Mr. English, is that the articles of association and memorandum would give indications of the extent to which the extinguished capital debt, or whatever represents the securities in place of the extinguished capital debt and extinguished loans, are available in various forms at the time of the creation of the company for purchase and on what terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to see how the declared objective of the Government of transferring the NFC to a Companies Act company can be achieved unless there are available articles of association. As I understand matters, the definition of a Companies Act company, which is referred to in the clause, must mean a company that is, at least at the time of its formation and from then onwards, covered and, to some extent, defined as to its purpose, scope of operations and a series of other important issues mentioned in the Companies Act by articles of association. I fail to see how, without articles of association, it can be a Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister's wish or intention may be that once the company is totally transferred—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is straying rather wide of the amendment. I said to him earlier that it was inappropriate to use a point of order to ask a question of the Minister, as he was doing. I did not mean to indicate that the right hon. Gentleman could suddenly stray out of subsection (4) into the whole principle of the clause, which will come to be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; You will appreciate, Mr. English, that my record on the Floor of the House is one which makes me the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1556</span>
last person to risk being accused of trying to stray out of order. I have raised few points of order—only two, I think—in the Chamber in the course of a continuous membership of the House since 1966.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Committee I have sought very carefully to follow the guidance that you, Mr. English, have given us about operating within the rules of order. I understood your earlier guidance to be that what we were discussing, the order in which we were discussing it and the way in which amendments are selected for discussion, depended on certain criteria, including the convenience of the Committee and the way in which the amendments were framed in relation to various clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if we come to a relevant point—and I submit that the articles of association of a Companies Act company must be relevant when we are discussing turning over important public assets to a Companies Act company—it is a matter of some concern to those of us pursuing our duty in the Committee of trying to examine and scrutinise in detail what is proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to that. In effect, I am simply saying to the right hon. Gentleman that he will not be able to do it twice. If it is desired to have a broad general debate on this rather narrow amendment I have no objection. But there will then be no clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not attempting at this stage to discuss anything but the straight propositions contained in our amendment relating to whether immediately prior to a certain date the loans and capital debt of the corporation are to be extinguished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other aspects of the clause must also be examined. We appreciate that they may be covered either in debates on amendments or in the clause stand part debate, but at present I am concentrating on a crucial issue concerned with timing, and whether the propositions in the Bill correspond with the reality that will result from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficulties are presented to the Opposition, and, I believe, to the Government side by the phraseology that has been used. However, the Minister has helped us. From his interventions I take it that he would not demur from my basic proposition that the intention is not immediately to extinguish the public holding, but to change its form. The actual transfer may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1557</span>
take place at a later date. In view of your guidance, Mr. English, I shall raise in respect of articles of association and memoranda only the questions that may be covered by that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the Minister's understanding that when a company is formed and takes over the whole or part of the assets of another company, the articles of association and memoranda of the second company will indicate whether it was formed solely for the purpose of operating the original assets or for the purpose of operating those and other assets? Does the Minister envisage that immediately after the public holding is extinguished it will be possible to sell shares without providing information on those points in the form of a memorandum circulated to those who may purchase the shares? Surely people will wish to know that information before they buy parts of this important public asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When will the Minister show us the parts of the articles of association and memoranda which, we assume, will have to give a clear indication to potential purchasers of the status of the holding? Will it indicate the reality? We assume that it cannot say, as the Bill does, that the public holding has disappeared. Will it indicate the true position of the public holding? Will it indicate the process of transfer of that holding? Will it indicate to potential purchasers how far their holding at the date of transfer governs their representation within the company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions are strictly related to the parts of the articles of association and memoranda connected with the myth of the immediate extinguishing of the massive public shareholding—the public's only shareholding in this important part of our transport system. I shall confine myself to those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. May I seek your guidance? I understand that a clause stand part debate was intended to cover the general aspects of a clause that have not been debated on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point on which I should like your guidance, Mr. English, is that a number of aspects of the clause are not covered by the amendments and my hon. Friends and I would like to refer to those aspects, which are unrelated to the point raised by my right hon. Friend. I hope that that will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1558</span>
in order on a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair never reaches a judgment on whether there should be a clause stand part debate until all emendments have been considered, because one can reach that judgment only in the light of discussions up to that point. I was endeavouring to warn the right hon. Gentleman that at present we are debating amendments relating to subsection (4). If the debate widened to the whole principle of the clause, it would endanger the possibility of a clause stand part debate. But the right hon. Gentleman immediately restored himself to order on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When dealing with the National Freight Corporation there are obviously a number of interests which the Government, with the help of the House, ought to safeguard. First, there is the interest of the corporation itself and those who work for it, its customers and its management. Secondly, there is the interest of the taxpayer, who is the sole owner and supplier of funds to the company at the moment. It is our belief that denationalisation of the company by the means proposed in the Bill will best serve the interests of the corporation, its customers, those work for it, and the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are concerned with the taxpayer's role, but it seems inappropriate that we should continue to have so much money locked into assets in a road haulage business when the Government have no interest in maintaining ownership of that business and there is a valuable asset which could, if marketed sensibly and carefully, produce worthwhile benefits for public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition criticise strongly the arrangements set out in the clause for moving towards denationalisation. I notice that Opposition Members on the Committee are not men who mince their words. They have a dramatic turn of phrase. We have had "rip-off" or "strip-off" from the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), "highway robbery" from the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), piranha fish eating field days with jam on from the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) and, finally, a prince being turned into a frog from the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). But I believe that all the heat is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1559</span>
being generated by a misunderstanding of the mechanics of how we are moving towards denationalisation, and I may be able to help the blood pressure of Labour Members if I explain the mechanics of the writing off of the capital debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals will be put into effect in two stages. The first will be the transferring of all the assets of the present corporation to a Companies Act-style company on an appointed day. It will be a company specially formed for the purpose and, as I made clear to the right hon. Gentleman, a company in which all the shares are to be held by the Minister or his nominees on behalf of the public. The company whatever it is called—the National Freight Company, or something of that sort—will become an ordinary Companies Act company with nothing particularly mysterious about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles of association, which have not yet been drafted, will contain no new political twists or nuances. It will be a company which happens to be 100 per cent. owned, as far as its equity capital is concerned, by the Minister or his nominees on behalf of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be open to the Minister and the Government of the day to decide that an appropriate stage has been reached when the Minister can sell some, or all, of the shares. The Government have made no secret of the fact that it is their intention to sell at an appropriate stage as many Government shares in that company as can be sensibly marketed. The reason that the date for marketing the shares is to be at the discretion of the Government, just as any shareholder may choose when to sell his shares, is so that the Government can look after the interests of the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the Government do not intend to give away public assets or to allow people to get a rake-off of public assets. It will be our intention in marketing the shares in the new company to get the best possible price for them, to choose a time and form of sale which will produce the maximum benefit for the taxpayer and public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to get the mechanics clear, the Minister said that there will be two stages, but surely there will be three. The first stage is the rip-off, when we get rid of the liabilities. Then the holding company is formed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1560</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is right to concentrate on exactly what the amendment is about, namely the nature of the Government's financial interest in the new company as compared with the present corporation. On the appointed day, when the transformation from corporation to Companies Act company takes place, it will remain a public assets, wholly owned by the Government. It is the nature of the Government's interest which will change—from the present £100 million of fixed-interest liabilities to equity capital, share capital. The Government, and therefore the public, will be exchanging one form of interest for another. There is no question of giving away or writing off the nature of the public interest. We are simply changing it to a form which will eventually be much more marketable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for doing that is not to give any covert advantage to our friends in the City or any of the other mythological motives imputed to us by the Opposition. It is that the new company could not possibly trade effectively if it began with its capital structure taking the form of this huge fixed-interest liability. That, of course, is one of the major constraints under which the corporation acts at the moment. It has a large amount of fixed-interest liability and its capital structure is all wrong. Even if we do not sell the shares and it remains a 100 per cent. Government-owned company, the capital structure will be much improved by turning all this fixed-interest liability into equity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what they want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we shall do. The resulting equity will be a marketable public asset. Before describing that as a great rip-off or suggesting that the change involves the sacrifice of a public asset, perhaps the Opposition will cast their minds back to the last capital reconstruction of the corporation under the previous Labour Government, which involved wiping off £53 million for no return whatever. The Opposition's criticism of subsection (4) is that it writes off the capital debts of the company, but subsection (4) writes off those debts in exchange for securities. The previous Government wrote off £53 million of capital debts in exchange for nothing. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) will no doubt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1561</span>
reply that it remained a totally publicly owned company, so the £53 million did not matter, but this company will also remain totally publicly owned, so the same argument applies. We are transferring the assets of the corporation to a wholly owned Government company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A soft-shoe shuffle by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the 1978 Act and what we are doing now are a capital reconstruction of a wholly owned company. Our action is intended to improve the trading position of the company and to prepare it for sale as a Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the pedantic points about writing off capital debt, I remind Labour Members that the last capital reconstruction, when they were in power, involved a straightforward writing off of £53 million in exchange for nothing whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point about writing off capital debt, but the question of ownership is a different point. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to recognise that by wiping off the debts, he will be achieving what the National Freight Corporation, British Rail and other nationalised industries have asked for. It is a form of equity financing, rather than the penal way of raising money used by the Treasury, with interest charges that lead to increased debts and problems for nationalised industries. There is a strong argument for equity financing. The National Corporation has asked before for stage 1, but not for stage 2 of selling off to the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But who is protecting the taxpayer now? The hon. Gentleman is saying that he would like other nationalised industries to be able to write off their capital debt completely. Several nationalised industries have had massive capital reconstructions involving the writing off of capital debt. It gets them out of appalling financial crises and enables them to make their results look better. The hon. Gentleman is in favour of wiping off capital debt by way of reconstruction, giving the public no benefit at all, merely to get the corporation out of a financial position into which its lack of trading success in the past has led it. Wiping off
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1562</span>
capital debts of nationalised industries merely enables them to carry on trading at a loss or in a way that is advantageous for them compared with their private-sector competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are writing off the capital debt in exchange for equity capital that will be wholly owned by the Government, who on behalf of the public, will be able to market that equity capital to the advantage of public funds and the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we had the last financial reconstruction, introduced by the previous Government—I moved an amendment in Committee to reduce the fixed-interest debt still further. In other words, to d o to a greater degree what the then Government were reluctant to do—to ease the trading position of the National Freight Corporation. My hon. Friend is doing what should have been done then. The only difference is that the taxpayer will ultimately get a far bigger return for the reduction of liabilities and the money will come back, because we are increasing the asset value of the NFC which will be disposed of at a fair market price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just so. I am grateful to my hon. Friend—who was on the Committee on the 1978 legislation, which I was not—for putting the matter in the context of the 1978 discussions. Subsection (4) provides for an essential technical step towards preparation for the sale. I hope that the majority of the Committee is satisfied that we are only converting the fixed-interest liabilities into equity stock, which can then be sold. I hope that I have satisfied the right hon. Gentleman that there is no question of a company being created with no owners in the meanwhile. The taxpayer should be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are preparing the way for an advantageous sale that will take place at a time and in a manner that will be judged by the Government as likely to produce the maximum return for the owners, who are the taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points and to put one question again, because it has not been answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister has referred to the write-off of £53 million from the debts of the NFC when it was publicly owned. It could be argued that anyone buying shares in the new company would be benefiting not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1563</span>
only from the £100 million write-off proposed by the Government, but from the £53 million write-off that has already gone through. That adds to, rather than detracts from, our case because it shows, in effect, that private purchasers would be benefiting from a write-off of £153 million paid by the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is surely pitting his case too modestly. He should not limit this to the £53 million that has just been written off in the latest capital construction. He should also include all the taxpayers' money that has been put in over the years. If he works that out, it comes to about £150 million of subsidies for the National Freight Corporation. Surely he should include all that, and then realise that if things carry on as at present, yet more taxpayers' money would have to be put in during the next decade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that anyone who buys shares in the new National Freight Company, if that is what it is to be, will benefit from public investment in it. But all along we have expressed severe doubts about whether they will be paying a price which reflects the cost of that public investment, and that is basically our objection to the whole damned thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will put again to the Parliamentary Secretary a question which I put earlier but I think that his crossword was distracting him on that occasion, as usual. I also remind him, while he is chatting, that the £100 million write-off is the first event before the appointed day, before shares are sold off. I should like to know whether that is to be regarded by the benighted loons at the Treasury, who mess up everyone's financing, as Department of Transport public expenditure which will be reckoned against that Department's general demand. Will that happen in the period between the write-off and the selling of shares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the second question is "No". I do not think that I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman on the first. He seems to want to regard the £53 million writing-off of debts that took place in 1978, and the constant subsidies over the years, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) referred, as something that the taxpayer is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1564</span>
entitled to recover. With a trading company or corporation of this kind, unfortunately one cannot regard it like that. The result of all the past subsidies and capital reconstructions has been to produce the corporation in its present form with its present value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all own an interest in the NFC. If one owns a company which trades at a loss for many years, for which loans to it have been written off in the past, one does not thereby add to the current value of the company. Whatever we do now, the corporation in its present form is worth a certain amount of money to the public and to potential purchasers. It so happens that, in its present form, it is not marketable, firstly because it is a statutory corporation and not yet a Companies Act company—which is one thing we propose to transfer—and, secondly, because of its capital structure, with its surviving £100 million of fixed-interest liabilities. All we are doing, therefore, is transferring it to a Companies Act company with a different capital structure which will make it marketable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actual value of the corporation is not altered by what was described as almost an accounting gesture. The value of the corporation at present is its value as a trading company, given the present rate of return of its assets, its present trading record, and so on. There is no use in the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South saying that because the last Government had to write off £53 million two years ago, somehow we must add £53 million to the price to get it back. That £53 million is gone and lost for ever, and more will be gone and lost for ever if we carry on with the NFC as a nationalised industry, subject to political direction and interference in its investment and management decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are turning it into a private sector company with a sensible capital structure. Then we will be able to realise such value as it has, and we intend to choose the time and form of sale in such a way as to obtain the best price possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get into an argument about what a rip-off is. We have made our points on that during Second Reading and in Committee, and I agree with the judgments that have been made. However, there are some issues arising from what the Minister said that are relevant to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1565</span>
First, the Government are not selling a loss-making company. That must be agreed, or they might consider selling a whole range of companies such as British Rail or British Steel. Presumably no purchaser, even in crazy Britain, would be likely to buy such a dead-loss company. So we start with the proposition that the NFC is a going commercial concern, which the subsection seeks to make more attractive to the private market. We can disagree among ourselves about the justification for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Minister gave his reasons for the Bill as being to give more flexibility and freedom by introducing a private sector element. That is the ideological difference between us. We believe that public ownership of industry or other assets is a means of achieving some form of control. That is our political position. I do not want to enter into a dispute on that subject because the difference is fundamental and reflected in our general approach to economic and political matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection seeks to write off the corporation's present liabilities—that is, the capital debts and loans. The next subsection is covered by other amendments and concerns who shall take it over and the rules governing transitional companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend has stated, the matter of the articles of association is important. Although we shall not debate that subject now, I hope that the Minister will take that on board, as it is relevant to subsection (5). As other Standing Committees have found, the principle of converting a nationalised concern to a Companies Act company is relevant to other matters such as aerospace and civil aviation. In one Committee articles of association were provided and I have copies of those. Therefore I hope the Minister will take that into account. It would be useful for this Committee to see the objectives that Government have in mind for the company that they propose to handle the resources of the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the subject of the wiping off of liabilities. There is a difference between us on how to finance nationalised industries. The clause says, in effect, "We no longer want the principle of financing nationalised industries to apply to the private sector." There is a penalty on nationalised industries for a number of reasons. They have to compete with the private sector. Indeed, on Second Reading
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1566</span>
the Minister made a point, which he has repeated on other occasions, concerning an industry as intensively competitive as the road haulage industry. He put that as a matter of Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is an intensely competitive industry but the NFC does not dominate it—it has control of about 10 per cent. of lorries. Although it is an important influence, for many good reasons that we shall point out later, it is not dominant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been faced with increasing difficulties arising from the principle embodied in subsection (4), which our amendment seeks to delete. It was given a commencing capital debt of about £99 million. The point made about the writing off of £53 million in 1978 was that that was the increase of the debt that had been incurred. The commencement debt and the loan debt totalled £153 million. A Labour Minister decided to write off £53 million of that sum to bring it back to its original level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister pointed out fairly, that same principle is involved in the clause—but that is an absolute write-off. The Labour Government wrote off some of the money on certain grounds. The NFC was made up of a whole host of companies merged into one and has as its heart an integration of transport systems. It has become a success—so successful that the Government now wish to sell it off to a private sector that could never have produced such a co-ordination. However, we shall come to that matter on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National Carriers was one of the companies that was taken over. It was accepted at the time, even by the Conservatives—and referred to a Select Committee looked into the National Freight Corporation—that there were very difficult problems with National Carriers and that nobody would have bought that company had it been put on the market. Therefore, the Government had to exercise judgments about jobs, development and all the other matters that were involved with National Carriers. We imposed a burden on the NFC by the special debts that would be incurred from operating National Carriers. The House agreed that money should be given directly to the company, not as loans, but as grants, to get it over its difficulties in the first four or five years of operation. It was a reducing level of debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the point that a nationalised
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1567</span>
industry was forced from the beginning to accept a company, not an commercial terms, but because of the necessity of maintaining that part of the road transport system within its control. Therefore, debts began to accumulate from the problems imposed not by a political, not a commercial decision. There may be disagreement between the two sides of the Committee whether that decision was right or wrong. A nationalised industry was saddled with considerable difficulties that would not have been imposed on the private sector. Obligations concerning workers and objectives in a private freight operation are different from those present arising in the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. PAUL DEAN 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the essential differences is the matter found in subsection (4). This is a radical subsection dealing with taking out capital debts and loans and the argument has been raised whether that is in the interest of the taxpayers. My hon. Friends have argued that the interest on loans and debts of £100 million is less than on those of £153 million. The Parliamentary Secretary made the fair point that the taxpayer had forgone his right of interest on £53 million that the Government could rightfully expect. But by driving the concern more into the ground the position would be reached where one was killing off the company by placing too heavy debts upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that there is an essential difference between the equity financing of a company and the financial obligations of a nationalised industry. The nationalised industries are forced to pay or increase their debts by meeting their obligations of interest payments on the loans or intensive debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do their competitors do in that position? It is a fair argument—and the National Freight Corporation has so argued—that if we are paying interest on loans and capital debt, as in the clause, that should be treated as a sort of dividend, because the position is similar to that of a private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does a private company do when it gets into a difficult situation, as in the road haulage industry, when many companies go bankrupt and the effect of price operations in those companies is dramatic? A private company can choose not to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1568</span>
pay a return on shareholdings. It does not carry the same financial penalties as the NFC has in the same competitive conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take a classic example, the same principles were involved earlier in the Bill when we asked that the National Bus Company be relieved of those obligations. We will deal with the point of principle on clause stand part, but that is the basic situation. The public sector is left with the same obligations, but they are removed from the private sector. Why is that? Clearly, it is because the private sector would not tolerate such conditions. It would refuse to accept such an unfair situation. It needs the flexibility, when times are bad, to decide whether to make payment on shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private sector has that ability to draw in when times are bad. That flexibility is denied to the nationalised industry, until it informs the Minister that if the logic of the principle of the nationalised industry's financial obligations as embodied in subsection (4) is pursued he will have no company left because it will go bust. In that situation, Governments are forced by the logic of the argument to reduce the debt. They therefore reduce the debt, and incur odium for the nationalised industries by saying that they are making losses again. The nationalised industry cannot win. I am bound to say that both Labour and Conservative Governments have acted on the same principle. What is worse from my view is that my own Government imposed the same obligations when in office. I disagreed violently with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was using some of those arguments to try to persuade the hon. Gentleman's Government to reduce the fixed-interest capital debt so that the NFC, particularly as it is in a highly competitive business, would have a much greater equity stake dividend capital. The hon. Gentleman has said that he disagrees, as the present Opposition Front Bench so often does, with the decisions taken by the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles of the financial obligations of nationalised industries go back further than the previous Labour Government. It has been a general principle to finance nationalised industries in that way for many years. I noted what the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1569</span>
Moate) said in his earlier intervention and I agreed with him. I like to approach arguments in terms of whether they are right or wrong. I am not ideologically obsessed about whether something was done by the previous Government or not. I do not know whether the last Labour Government were obsessed with ideology, but I will not pursue that argument while my right hon. Friend is here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the principles involved in the present argument, if a practice has been pursued that is found to be of considerable disadvantage to the nationalised industries, which constantly ask for a change to some sort of equity financing, I think that we have to agree that there is some common ground between us about fairness of treatment for a nationalised undertaking and a private undertaking in a similar competitive position in the same industry. If that is common ground, I hope that the hon. Member for Faversham will put his support where his ideas appear to be and support our views on the National Bus Company also. That is the logic of the argument. If we can agree to take away the obligations on the NFC in order to sell to the private sector and the hon. Gentleman wishes to apply the same criteria to the National Bus Company, I suggest that he should support Opposition amendments on that aspect when we come to Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will rethink their position on that matter, because it is the same argument, with just one difference. A private sector National Freight Corporation is to be treated differently from the way in which it is treated as a nationalised industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must not widen the argument to the whole question of how nationalised industries are financed. There is no point in drawing a direct analogy between a nationalised industry and a private sector company when the nationalised industry is trading at a loss, is probably technically insolvent and looks to the Government for all its future investment and capital. That is the position of the other industries that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned—British Rail, the National Bus Company and so on. I agree that the NFC is not in that condition, but it was when its capital debts were being written off. It is now turning round. It is being allowed to work commercially and being put on the right footing vis-a-vis its private sector competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1570</span>
Even for companies that remain nationalised we have public dividend capital, but that is suitable only for profitable public sector trading companies. Those can be put on a similar footing to companies in the private sector. One cannot make sweeping comparisons between the operation of companies in the private sector and the inherently loss-making trading companies that constantly look to the taxpayer for more and more money. The taxpayer would lose a fortune if the two were not treated differently. That is why those companies are always saddled with fixed-interest debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I get the impression that we are now straying into the question of the finance of nationalised industries. We are getting some way from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Dean. But the Minister is saying that because the National Freight Corporation is changing from a nationalised industry to a private industry the obligations that were incumbent on it as a nationalised industry will no longer apply. That is an important issue. However, we have thrashed it out, and we shall probably have another opportunity to deal with it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically our point is that by taking out subsection (4)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it to my hon. Friend that the amendment under discussion does not in fact take out subsection (4). We shall come to that argument when we discuss amendment No. 272. If the amendment under discussion were carried it would mean that the transfer of public assets would no longer be subject to subsection (4). In so far as my hon. Friend is investigating what conditions should govern the transfer of public assets he is clearly dealing with the substance of that amendment, as opposed to amendment No. 272.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably time for me to say that the difference between the two sides will clearly continue. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will give some indication with regard to the articles of association and memorandum. I leave the argument about the principle of financing. It is a cardinal point, and one which we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1571</span>
shall seek to debate further both in the Committee and on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To continue with the point that I made in my intervention in my hon. Friend's speech, I take it that we are discussing the issue of whether the transfer should be subject to subsection (4). We are not discussing whether a condition should operate in other respects. I was therefore interested to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary deploying his considerable persuasive skills in order to assure us that by making the transfer subject to subsection (4) we would not remove a safeguard from the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he believed that the public interest will be safeguarded because subsection (4) does not extinguish the public holding. It only transfers the public holding from one type of shareholding to another. The present public shareholding consists of loans and debts, but the public shareholding after the transfer will be a form of equity capital. That is the argument put to us by the Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to push the hon. Gentleman considerably further on how far the condition laid down in subsection (4) is essential to protect the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that there is no need for the public to worry, because they will have an equity holding in place of the loans and debts on which they are receiving £8 million a year. The public will, therefore, have a considerable financial interest in the operation, even if one leaves aside their interest in an efficient element of freight transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a direct question that I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can answer. What happens to the money earned on those equity shares or securities held by the public from the day of the transfer? How does that money flow to the public and how does it compare with the way in which the £8 million a year fixed-interest return on the debts and loans flows to the public? Other parts of the clause cast considerable doubt on whether all the money earned by that equity comes to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to continue making speeches on the amendment, but I can answer that specific and important question. Any dividends received—as the position of the company
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1572</span>
improves we trust that it will contemplate paying dividends—will be paid into the Consolidated Fund, as is usual with dividends from publicly owned shareholdings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. The intention is clear. Instead of the public receiving the fixed interest on the loans and debts, they will receive the dividends on equity shares. Therefore, whether the public interest is safeguarded in relation to the money they get back immediately following the transfer depends, in part, on whether the dividends on the public equity shareholding compare reasonably with the fixed interest on the loans and debts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman gets further along that road, do I understand that, as regards the NFC, the Opposition Front Bench is in favour of a transfer from fixed-interest capital to dividend capital? The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has stated that the Opposition want to see this change from the guaranteed £8 million to the increased uncertainty of the return on dividend capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not our position. I accept the relevance of the question. We can see that there are circumstances in which there could be a valid argument for the Government saying that the NFC can operate better under equity capital conditions than under fixed interest. That is a respectable argument which we can understand. It may well be the case—this is the view held by a number of people who have worked in the NFC—that there are circumstances in which the NFC could be advantaged by the much greater flexibility of the equity capital operation. To put that in terms which might be used by a director: it would be better not to be forced to pay out a fixed sum every year—it would be better, in the public interest, to pay more in some years, less in other years, and in certain years to use more of the profit to develop the size of the business and, therefore, increase the value of the public asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the argument between us. We are not saying that it is wrong for the Government to transfer the public's interest from fixed-interest loans to equity capital, but we believe that it is wrong to do that solely in order to sell the public's interest in the NFC at the very point when the NFC is enabled to operate more effici-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1573</span>
ently, and when, because of its changing capital construction, it can develop the public's assets. It almost appears that the Parliamentary Secretary is telling us "Don't look at why we are doing it, just look at what we are doing."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not watch this hand, watch the other one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The parliamentary draftsman who works for the Ministry of Transport is half parliamentary draftsman, half conjurer, a clever man who can write in subsection (4) that the Government will, on a certain date, extinguish completely all those loans and holdings, when, in reality, there will be no change at all in the holding of the assets. That draftsman obviously has some influence on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary is doing the other famous conjuring trick, saying "Do not ask why we are doing it, look at what we are doing." It is as though he was saying "Do not ask why I am exchanging a pea shooter for a shotgun. Never mind what I want the shotgun for." We agree that one must exchange a pea shooter for a shotgun if one wants to shoot wood pigeons which are eating the crop. We do not agree that one should exchange the pea shooter for a shotgun if one wants to shoot farmhands up the backside because one does not think that they are keeping up the productivity rate that the farmer wants. That is the difference between us, put in rather simple, crude terms. I hope that that answers the point made by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree that, however it is done, the terms of subsection (1) must protect the public interest. If subsection (4) is merely the means by which the public interest is changed from the debt or loan into the equity holding, we want to know how the public is to be protected in the equity holding. They are certainly not protected by the fact that their interest shall not be sold, because the Minister has made clear that it can be sold. In fact, it is a device to enable the public interest to be sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second question arises. How much will we, the public, get in return for the shares? There are no articles of association yet drafted which will show us how the operation will be dealt with in terms of the sale of the public's assets. It is a most
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1574</span>
unsatisfactory position and we insist, for the purposes of discussing the clause and the amendment, that we should at least have a draft of that part of the articles of association that bears upon the operation described in subsection (4) and the way in which the assets come into the hands of the Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other questions—whether the public interest is safeguarded and whether it is an advantageous sale—turn on a matter that is not in subsection (4), although it is within the broad terms of subsection (1) which we seek to amend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much will it cost the taxpayer to create the conditions in which there can be a sale? The Minister proposes that part of the taxpayer's return, part of what is obtained from selling the taxpayer's interest in NFC, should not go back to the taxpayer, but be used for another purpose related to getting rid of liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that they are public liabilities because the public owns the corporation, but it must be legitimate to take account of that in the calculations of whether it is in the taxpayer's financial interest to have this wonderful conjuring trick turned into the reality of a sale of assets. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how he can contend that the public interest is safeguarded if he agrees that we are considering a device by which he sells the public interest, that the proceeds of the sale of the assets do not all go to the public, who own it—a part is used for other purposes—and that the dividend on the public holding comes back to the public?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public get the dividend on the shares or securities that they get in exchange for the loans and debts, but what do the public get from the sale of assets when the shares are sold? It is certainly not the whole return and, therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot get away with his assertion that they are protected because they will have shares in return. He cannot say that unless he indicates how much of the assets will come back to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have all made a number of speeches on the amendment. I shall allow the right hon. Gentleman to have the political last word and answer his factual questions, in order to facilitate our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have any draft articles of association at the moment. They are being drafted by those who give legal advice to the Government. I understand that another
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1575</span>
Committee was given draft articles of association, but the arrangements for sale in that case were much more advanced than ours. As I have stressed, we do not intend an immediate sale. We intend to judge the best time in the public interest—that being when the company's track record and commercial position makes it an attractive proposition. That is in the interests of the public, as owner, and that of the workforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The articles of association will not contain any surprises. They will follow the form described in table A of the Companies Act. The final shape of the memorandum will depend on the final capital structure of the new company. That need not be comprised entirely of shares. As the Bill stands, it could be part shares and part loan stock. It will be decided by the Government as we approach the appointed day and set up the company to which the assets will be transferred. The main factor that we shall bear in mind was one that was troubling the right hon. Gentleman. In setting up the new company, in which the public will be, in effect, the 100 per cent. shareholder, we shall, in the short term, forgo £8 million on £100 million of fixed-interest debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the new company is set up and we move to the appointed day when my right hon. Friend will transfer the assets of the National Freight Corporation to the new company, the Government will have to make a decision about the speed with which they will go on to the next stage of sale. If a reasonable time elapses between the formation of the company and its subsequent sale, it is likely that its capital structure will contain a large element of convertible fixed-interest loan stock, together with equity. Therefore, fixed interest will be paid on that convertible loan stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we move to the second stage, which is flotation—the sale of shares in the new company to the general public—the convertible loan stock will be converted into equity, that is its final marketable form, and the public will be able to get the second part of the bargain—the full value of their marketable public asset. We shall not necessarily forgo all interest in the interim period. We shall continue to receive interest and, at the end, have a realisable capital asset as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new company will have share capital on which dividends will be payable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1576</span>
and, whether it is all equity or only part equity, all dividends paid on its equity capital will come to the public through the Consolidated Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that satisfies the right hon. Gentleman. I believe that once the mechanism is examined carefully, it will be found to be in the public interest. It will preserve some income for the corporation in the short term, and make marketable an asset that is not marketable with its present capital structure. Again, the taxpayer will benefit from the price paid for those assets. Given that purpose of clause 36 (4), I invite the Committee to reject the amendment and to keep the subsection as part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand the reasons that the Minister has given, while not totally accepting them. However, in view of the memorandum that was provided for another Committee, I wonder whether he will consider giving us information, perhaps when we come to subsection (5), about what he considers to be the company's objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Freight Corporation's objectives were specific in respect of integration, and so on. The Minister must have an idea of what is envisaged as the likely objectives that could go in a memorandum. If we cannot have the memorandum or articles, perhaps he will at least give us a statement later about whether he feels that the objectives will be different from those of the NFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I anticipate that such objectives will, in lay language, be to continue the trading activities of the freight corporation, but they will not contain any political constraints that would inhibit the ability of the company to trade in a commercial manner. We intend that the company will operate in a thoroughly commercial way and acquire a track record and performance that will make it a worthwhile investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The word "integration" is coming back into fashion with the Labour Party and its new transport team. That is unfortunate, as it was last beloved of the Labour Party in 1968, since when nobody in either the Labour or Conservative Parties has been able to make the slightest sense of what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word is usually interpreted by Socialist politicians as trying to force customers to use a mode of transport that they show a marked reluctance to use. No one has found a way of doing that in practice, and it has done a great deal of damage. I assure the Committee that in the new company's memorandum there will be no obligation to achieve an integrated transport system. That would be an unhappy burden with which to saddle it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will bear with me on this point, because I believe that it is crucial. It is intended that the Bill should give the Minister flexibility about the time of sale of all the loan stock and the equity? How can that be reconciled with the proposition in the Bill that appears to require the sale within one year of sufficient of the assets to pay for the specific provision to remove the funding liability? Who takes over the funding liability in the event of there not being a sufficient sale of assets in the year to cover the funding liability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill gives complete flexibility over when to sell. I have explained several times that we shall sell only at the time we judge to be in the owners'—that is the taxpayers'—interest, namely when the market and the company's commercial position are such as to produce the best price. Only at the stage of sale will part of the proceeds be transferred, to get rid of the obligation to fund pensions, as referred to later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no fixed time within which the sale has to take place, but whenever that happens, part of the proceeds will be used to put the pensions obligations into a sensible state and to meet the funding obligations relating to pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 278, in page 32, line 41, leave out "and without further assurance."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to delay the Committee long, as this is in the nature of a probing amendment. To use a pun, if the Parliamentary Secretary can give us an assurance,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1579</span>
perhaps we may not push the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear that once the Bill becomes an Act and the sale of land or anything else takes place, the only reference to any deed will be to the Bill. If that is the case, we feel that by taking out the words "and without further assurance" those transactions would take a normal pattern. If, alas, the Bill goes through we may well see a depot being sold, possibly just for its land, and the only reference to the transaction will be the Bill. We think that that is basically wrong and that taking the words "and without further assurance" out of the clause would meet the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary can give the Committee some sort of legal answer I may withdraw the amendment, but that depends upon the assurance he gives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has pointed out, this is a probing amendment, but it is probing an important point. As I understand it, the term "without further assurance" means that if anybody is having any dealings with the new company, the title for any property will be the Bill if it becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to demonstrate the importance of that aspect by indicating the possible scale and value of what will be affected. I believe that purchasers of the National Freight Company, if that is what it is to be called, will be concerned with the value of its real estate. If we look at the last annual report of the NFC we find that its total assets are about £100 million and that of those, land and buildings represent £60 million. Having looked at various National Carriers' depots at one time or another, it is clear to me that the bulk of the value of the land and buildings is in the land and not the buildings, because some of the buildings look to be more a liability than an asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point to remember is that the £60 million estimate for the land and buildings was determined in 1969. There has been a trifle of inflation since then. The inflation of land values in particular has been extraordinary. In London it has been five, or even 10 fold. That is some indication of the massive value of the NFC's real estate and some indication of the impact of a Bill which will mean that those who wish to buy that real estate, and want the title to the land, will be referred to an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be many possibilities of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1580</span>
dispute. I do not have one jot of concern for the bulk of the likely purchasers of these assets. In fact, if deleting "without further assurance" reduces the problems for potential speculators in NFC property I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment, because there is nothing that we would like better than to cause them bother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, if there are to be disputes about such matters as the boundaries of land held by the NFC, wayleaves over property, covenants affecting NFC property, and various use rights in planning, there will be an impact on people who own neighbouring land, or possible disputes with British Rail about the ownership and future use of the land. There may also be disputes with planning authorities. Consequently, we are concerned about the delimitation of NFC property boundaries and the rights and obligations that go with that property. We must protect the interests of people living near NFC land and of the planning authorities seeking to do their job in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If leaving "without further assurance" in the Bill means that some property speculators will get their fingers burnt up to their elbows, my hon. Friend and myself will be as happy as Larry, although Larry is not present in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely clear on this aspect, despite the assistance that we have had from various sources on the meaning of "without further assurance." I do not suggest that in all circumstances the NFC will not have fully documented titled deeds to some of the property it owns, but I suspect that, particularly as regards the property of National Carriers, which was transferred from BRB, there will be significant difficulties about the title to the land. We need clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the same line of interrogation and I will probably give away my age my recalling a song that begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Three little words, oh what I'd give for that wonderful phrase".</p></blockquote>
The three words "without further assurance" have caused considerable concern to a number of people who have a keen interest in the Bill. At least two constructions are being put on them, and I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether they are valid. One is that the words are the means by which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1581</span>
Minister is enabled to transfer assets en bloc and that without the words the provision of the Companies Act would require that certain assets would need to be transferred on an individual basis or with separate documents. If so, we want to know whether, if the words are included, only the en bloc transfer is possible and there is no possibility of transferring assets separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other construction apparently being put upon the words "without further assurance" is that it might be possible for the Minister to transfer without revealing memoranda or articles of association. I understand that in normal circumstances the transfer of assets from one company to another—in this case, from a public corporation to a private company—would be governed to a considerable extent by memoranda and articles of association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous debate, the Parliamentary Secretary made clear that without the memoranda we cannot know what the financial construction will be. To the extent that we are here pursuing seriously the public interest, and that without the memoranda we do not know how much of the public interest is to be represented by fixed-interest capital and how much by equity, it is extremely important for us to have a clear understanding of what these three little words mean and to decide whether the limitation being placed upon the right of Parliament to exercise control over the transfer of a public asset is acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This began as a probing amendment. I am not surprised, as the words are somewhat Delphic at first sight. They certainly require some explanation. However, I assure that the Opposition that the only effect of the amendment would be to necessitate conveyancing and legal paperwork, which would bring more fees to lawyers, but would otherwise cause no inconvenience to anybody. That is the only attractive argument that I can see for the amendment, but I do not think that as a Committee we should press that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has convinced me. I surrender!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words "without further assurance" mean, in lay language, without any further conveyance or legal docu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1582</span>
ment transferring the property. The clause as it stands provides that the Bill will transfer the whole of the undertaking en bloc. It is arguable that without those words, in order for the property to pass from the National Freight Corporation to the National Freight Company, as we are calling it for the purposes of the debate, a separate conveyance would have to be sought in each case—and not just a conveyance of freehold, but transfers of leases, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the word "assurance" is a term of art covering conveyancing, transfers of leases, and so on. It means that in looking for the transfer of property from the National Freight Corporation to the limited company one need look only to the Bill and need not seek any further document of transfer. Conveyancing would therefore be simplified, because where the National Freight Corporation can prove its title to property it will be able to be assumed that the National Freight Company is the owner. For all I know, there may be problems with the title to some of the property. That is not a matter in which Ministers are involved. Clearly, the new company will own only property to which the predecessor, the corporation, can prove good title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a conveyance, therefore, one would still need to go back to the roots of the title to see how the National Freight Corporation is able to claim ownership, but one would not need any separate document witnessing the transfer from the corporation to the company. There is no further problem than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sale of land is obviously involved. When one sells a company, one sells the land and other assets. At present, of course, the corporation deals in land. It sells land; it acquired more land; it trades in a perfectly ordinary way. It is no good describing anybody who ever purchases land from anybody else as a land speculator. There are usually good reasons for transferring property backwards and forwards. The book value of the companys" freehold interest in land at the end of 1978 was still £60 million, although it was acquiring and disposing of land even during that year. I understand that some of its best assets are holes in the ground, of which it has a number, which are used for waste disposal purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "without further assurance" are not concerned with the value of the assets or giving any special way of dealing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

with them to the successor company. The intention is merely to avoid unnecessary legal conveyancing. I am sure that as he is not here under the guise of a lawyers' protector the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central will be satisfied with that explanation and will be content to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to a further important series of what may be described as anti-rip-off amendments. They are intended to ensure that when the Minister takes the NFC to his bosom on the appointed day he sets up a new company that will be wholly owned by the Government and the sole purpose of which will be to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1584</span>
take over and continue the operations of the NFC. That organisation should not, at that time or at any time when the Minister is in control of it, operate for any purpose other than that of running the NFC. It should be wholly owned by the Government and the directors should be appointed by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will ensure that there will be provision, as there is with the present NFC, for the appointment of trade union directors to continue. I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to the notes that were produced on the meeting of the TUC transport policy committee with his right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport on 19 November 1979. The Minister said that he would be making a statement on the criteria for appointing board members during the Transport Bill debate. We still await that statement. I hope that we shall hear it now, or certainly by the time that we discuss the amendments relating to directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman give me the reference that he was quoting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pass it across to the Minister and borrow my hon Friend's copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want some indication of the sort of company that the Minister seeks to establish. We should like to assist the Minister to establish an organisation of the type that he said that he was setting out to establish. He said that he would not be selling individual NFC subsidiaries to the highest bidder. On Second Reading, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The whole purpose of this Bill is to enable us to sell shares in the enterprise as a whole. We want it to go into private ownership as a single entity* without any major change in size or range of interests".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1129.]</p></blockquote>
The object of this series of amendments is to go some way towards achieving that end. We are thoughtful people, so we also wish to relieve the Minister of the temptation of not doing what he said that he wished to do. We wish to take temptation out of his way and prevent him from being subjected to all sorts of blandishments, from such devious and dubious people as Treasury Ministers and officials, to do things, once the company comes into his control, that he had not originally wanted to do. We want to give him
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1585</span>
statutory backing to help him fend off such pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be pressure from the Treasury to make a quick killing by juggling the structure of the new company for a quick bit of asset stripping while it is still in the Minister's possession. That would bring the whole system that he is trying to establish into total disrepute, but it would be of immediate benefit to the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason for the amendment is that we do not want the Minister to pick on an existing company and say: "Will you take on the task of running the National Freight Corporation?" We do not want him to pick up an existing property company, for instance. We want other restraints built in. We want a new company to do the job that the Minister has said all along that he wants it to do. We want a company with functions and directors that be directed to keeping the national freight organisation operating as a freight organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously a period of reflection is necessary before the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary decide whether to accept the amendments, but if they are not prepared to accept the general spirit of the amendments, which are designed to ensure that the new company is wholly new, with the specific purpose of running the national freight organisation, and to protect their desire to do what they say they want to do, we shall doubt whether we can place any faith in the Minister's assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that the amendments would help the Minister to do what he has said he wants to do, but equally important, the Bill will impose on any Minister the duty that it imposes on the present Minister of Transport. The right hon. Gentleman may suddenly be elevated to high places and someone else will take his place. The same duty would be imposed on the replacement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's point. I spoke of helping to protect the Minister and the transport industry against possible Viking raids and depredations by the Treasury—although I cannot imagine any people looking less like rapers and pillagers than those who work at the Treasury. But their function has often been to act like that with public assets, or even with private assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wolves in sheep's clothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been directing my attention to achieving a statute that will protect the interests of the National Freight Corporation and the intentions of the existing Minister from depredations by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) has pointed out, perhaps we should enshrine the Minister's intentions in the legislation, so that if he is replaced, or there is a general attempt to shift the presently enunciated Government policy on which the Bill has been based, there will be a statutory basis for fending off attacks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord knows, the policy has changed, even under the present Minister, because within the duration of this Parliament, we have moved from the position that there might be a Bill to allow private investment in the National Freight Corporation to the Government holding more than 50 per cent. of the shares to an apparent proposal that every shred of shares was to be sold. Now there seems to be some backtracking, and the possibility of an intention to retain a vestigial share in the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the amendments will provide that element of protection which is intended to ensure that in the long run the NFC will be kept together and will have a board of directors and a general company structure designed to ensure that, with its multiplicity of transport interests, it will be able to continue without any diversions or pressure because of the introduction of an existing company structure to be superimposed on to it and that we shall have a company designed to do the job of running the corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am touched by my hon. Friend's concern to protect the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary from the Treasury. It seems that even when we are dealing with bitterly controversial transport policy matters, there is still a certain camaraderie amongst Members interested in transport in wanting to see Ministers protected from the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not the most important aspect of this group of amendments. That arises clearly from the ambiguous drafting of the clause. As in so many other parts of the Bill, we find a clause which seems to be saying two things at once. The latter part of subsection (5) gives the impression
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1587</span>
that the only possible company to which the public assets of the NFC could be transferred is a company that would own only the assets of NFC and no others. Reading the last part of the subsection in isolation, that would seem to be the only sort of company that could be considered. If that was all that the Bill provided about the transfer nomination or appointment of the company, we should not have the fear and worry that is expressed in our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But subsection (5) also says other things. Amendment No. 299 draws attention to the fact that there appears to be a discretion vested in the Minister as to the company or type of company to which he would transfer assets. Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may by order made by statutory instrument nominate for the purposes of"</p></blockquote>
—which clearly appears to confer a discretion on the Minister, whether or not he intends to use it, and, if he does, whether he will use it in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to make clear beyond per-adventure that if this exercise is to be conducted—and we are not keen on it—it should be conducted in the way that the Minister intends. It is not our definition, it is the Minister's definition. He has said
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1588</span>
that he wants to transfer the assets to a company the initial purpose of which will be to own and manage those assets and that, initially, the Minister will be the sole holder of shares on behalf of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist if I intervene to say that I accept that the Government's intention is exactly as the right hon. Gentleman described. It may help also if I say that I will help to meet it be accepting amendment No. 279, which will confine the Minister's powers to a company formed for the purposes of the section—which means that it will be a company specifically formed to acquire the assets of the NFC. It resolves the ambiguity assets of the NFC. It resolves the amiguity, although, of course, we never intended to give it to any other company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
