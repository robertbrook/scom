	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government note that we are assisting them by making up the quorum. Despite all that has been said about time-wasting, it is the Opposition who are providing sufficient members of the Committee for the debate to start. I hope that we shall not hear too much about timetable motions from the Government later, when they cannot now produce a team even to start our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the break in our proceedings, I was talking about the difference between express and tour bus operation. The Parliamentary Secretary made clear—and we are agreed—that if a passenger travels more than 30 miles in a vehicle that will be one of the major qualifications in denning an express operation. There is no requirement for permission from the commissioner, as with present legislation, but only that he should be informed—in a prescribed form—about the nature of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said that there may be a commitment to a service. Presumably that means that a bus service may be run from A to B perhaps a certain number of times a week under the conditions of an express service. I am concerned particularly in the light of our amendment concerning tours, at the differences between the two operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the tour operator. The example readily springs to mind of one who offers an excursion to a particular spot. At present he is required to have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
licence for an excursion of less than 30 miles, and under certain conditions there must be agreement from the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, what happens if the distance is greater than 30 miles? Let us suppose that there are excursions to the seaside from the city of Leeds, which would certainly be more than 30 miles. It would be a regular passenger service. Particularly in the summer and at weekend, people would want to visit the seaside town of Bridlington. There might be two forms of traffic— that associated with a day out at the seaside, and that of travelling for business or other reasons, which is not normally covered by tour arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, the express operator goes to the traffic commissioner and gives him an indication of his intention to start a service two or three times a week from Leeds to Bridlington. He requires no permission for that, but simply says "Mr. Commissioner, I now intend to provide this service."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another tour operator may decide that he wants to operate only at a profitable time—say on a Saturday rather than a Wednesday. He could be in the same situation that arose in our argument about cross-subsidisation. Another operator who wished to operate a service three times a week might be prepared to provide more services on Saturdays in order to carry on with less profitable business on Mondays and Wednesdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that it is now possible—I should like the Minister to confirm this— that a tour operator is not required to give notice to a commissioner that he intends to run a business on a Saturday in competition with the private operator of an express service. If the express operator is required to give notice to the commissioner about services, routes and times, why is the tour operator not required to give such notice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily concede that there are many examples of tours that may not fit into that category, but we are in a grey area where it may be difficult to distinguish between the tour operator's activity and the express service, except that one will have been notified to the commissioner and the other will not. Why maintain that distinction? As my right hon. Friend said, should not the commissioner, on receiving such notice, be able to decide whether there was a duplication of services and whether the express service would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
undermined? Presumably he would then be able to refuse a licence to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks to show that there is an artificial distinction made between a tour operator and an express service, and we have used the same basic economic arguments that we have employed on other amendments. That may undermine an express service operator who might operate a subsidised service showing his commitment—to use the words of the Parliamentary Secretary—to provide some form of service on the route—presumably taking over from the National Bus Company which regularly operates that route, under a licensed arrangement, which is cross-subsidised by a local authority that gives a transport supplementary grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary will probably agree that that is just one of the anomalies. Information will not have to be given to the commissioner, and the two services will compete, with the likelihood that the man operating a service on Saturdays in summer—when it is profitable—will pull out and no service will be provided in the winter when business is not profitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary made clear before lunch that he was hostile to our amendment. He said that his ground for hostility was that he wanted to see virtually unregulated competition for all vehicles that fell within the express carriage definition, including those used by tour and excursion operators. He said that I was looking at the problem in the wrong way if I considered that it was a problem to have tour and excursion operators subject to regulation if they were inside the distance definition for express and not outside. The hon. Gentleman said that I should address myself to the question whether it was justifiable to have any road licence check on them when they operated within the express service definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a clear difference of opinion and I do not expect the Minister to be converted. However, for that reason I want to put three specific questions to him one of which has already been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question is rather narrow. Given the Government position in the Bill, how can there be any check on whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
those who are operating on the borderline of the express carriage limit are within or outside this part of the Bill? The definition of the distance limit is complex. It is not just a straight 30 miles. An excursion that ran much more than 30 miles could be caught by the road service licence provision provided that nowhere on the route was more than 30 miles from the starting or finishing point, whereas another operator whose route, though shorter than 30 miles did at one point go further than the 30 mile limit would be exempt. The question of how checks could be made is complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question to the Minister is, how can checks be made if there is no obligation to notify? Take the case I cited of someone who turns up in the market place on a Saturday morning and chalks on a board the details of an excursion. It will be impossible to tell by looking at the board whether the journey will be within or without the express carriage limit. That would depend upon the route taken. The board might even say "mystery tour". There would then be the gravest of difficulties. Clearly, it is almost impossible to check. The serious question is, how can it be checked? How can we ensure that the proposed law can be operated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question concerns the definition that the Minister intends to use for tours or excursions. That is a difficult area. The law does not make many distinctions between tours, excursions and express operations, other than that involved in the amendment—that is whether there is a requirement to notify. It seems to me—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong— that it is not proposed that the Bill should alter the definition of excursion or tour made in the 1968 Act. I am therefore working on that as the correct definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1968 Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"excursion or tour means, subject to section 21(2) and (3) of this Act, a service for the carriage of passengers by road which is, or is predominantly, of such a nature that it could be provided under a road service licence authorising only excursions or tours, that is to say, is a service which consists, or consists predominantly, of the carriage by stage or express carriage of passengers at separate fares entitling those passengers to travel together on a journey, with or without breaks, the timing of which is not regulated by the terms of the road service licence, from the place or places at which the passengers are taken up (being the same place or two or more places in the same vicinity) to one or more places and back to the place or places at which they were taken up".</p></blockquote>
It is clear that that definition of excur-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
sion or tour covers a much wider area than the sort of excursion or tour referred to by the Minister. That definition could embrace many services similar to those covered under the express service provisions in the Bill. Is the 1968 definition relevant? If so, how can he draw a distinction between those who run services defined as express services and those who call themselves tour or excursion operators?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question merely supplements that raised by my hon. Friend. I need not spend much time on it. I simply ask when a tour or excursion ceases to be a tour or excursion by virtue of the frequency with which it is made. If a man runs a service from one town to another once a week and calls it a tour or excursion, will that be all right? What if he runs the service twice a week, or every day, or three times a day? At what point does it cease to be a tour or excursion and—given that it meets the complicated definition that we now have about the distance—become another express coach operation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless that is known, I see no justification for the distinction that the Minister maintains should remain in the clause and I see every reason for accepting our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), but he made no attempt to intervene earlier in the debate and I am now in the process of making my second reply. Perhaps I may deal with the questions that have been raised by the right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the extremely narrow point of whether, if an excursion or tour at any point goes more than 30 miles from the point of origin, the operator of such an excursion or tour should notify the traffic commissioners. I think that it all boils down to one point, stated again a few moments ago by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). Given that we impose upon an express service the obligation to notify, why do we not impose a similar obligation on an excursion or tour? We therefore come back to the essential difference between an
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
express service and an excursion or tour. I shall come on to the legal definition, but I will begin by trying to put it in lay language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An express service is a regular, scheduled service going from point A to point B and back again and running to a published timetable. People planning to make a journey between two centres may therefore consult the timetable and find that every Friday afternoon, say, there is a bus that leaves Leeds at 5 o'clock and gets into Bridlington at a set time. Or a service may leave Nottingham every Friday at 5 o'clock and arrive at Skegness at 7 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operator of such a service therefore notifies the traffic commissioners in order to indicate commitment, because we do not want people deciding to run a service one week and deciding not to run it the next week because it makes a loss. There is also a practical difference for the passengers. In the case of an express service, if only one person turns up at 5 o'clock in the old market square in Nottingham, the service still has to run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is a scheduled service. In the same way a train will pull out of a station with only one passenger on it. The station master will not cancel it because only one person has turned up. It is a scheduled service. It therefore leaves at the set time, and the public need to know that it is reliable and not subject to cancellation. Notification is therefore given to the traffic commissioners and the service runs accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An excursion or tour is, to use lay language once again, in the nature of a holiday trip or excursion or a mystery tour or something similar. The passengers may get on and off at Nottingham, but they could go on an outing for the day to Skegness and come back again in the evening. All the passengers would go out on the journey and come back again. That is not a scheduled service. It may just be a one-off trip because it is thought that on a particular weekend in the summer there will be enough people wanting to go to Skegness for it to be worthwhile for the operator to advertise and see how many people turn up. Most operators run on the basis, that is perfectly possible with excursions or tours at present, that if not enough people turn up the trip is subject to cancellation and they get their money
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
back because it is not worth going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the services are different entities, it is on that basis that we propose in the Bill that the scheduled service needs the commitment and notification. It is really in order to make sure that the public know where they are. With excursions or tours there is not the same requirement at the moment. One does not need the same undertaking that the timetable will be adhered to, because an excursion does not have a timetable. It is by nature a one-off trip that the operator will try to market as best he can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there will be occasions when the two will sail rather close together. There may be a passenger who lives in Nottingham but has business in Skegness, or a man in Leeds who has business in Bridlington. I am sure, that occasionally, an individual who has to make a journey for business reasons, works out that the cheapest way of transacting his business in Skegness during the day and getting back home at night is to travel on a holiday excursion. He does not have to join the women's institute or a club to do so. He simply goes to one of the coach operators and finds himself on a coach with a number of people who have buckets and spades and are going to the seaside for the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That man cannot be stopped. There is no way that the traffic commissioners can stop a businessman, clutching a briefcase, from joining an excursion because he has business to transact in a seaside town and has worked out that the excursion trip is the cheapest way of getting there and back. I do not see the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other difficulty that Labour Members anticipate is the problem of competition. What if tours are run with such regularity that they damage the express? With respect, that argument relates to the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to explain why we believe that regulation of competition—the protection of the interests of the bus and coach operators—is not of paramount importance when discussing long-distance excursions, tours and trips. It is an area in which we wish to encourage competition. As I have indicated by quoting market reasearch in the National Bus Company, we consider that it is an area into which more people will come and where, at present, the market is underexploited and not overloaded. Regulation of competition is regulation for regulation's sake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
The right hon. Gentleman's idea that an operator shall have to notify the traffic commissioners of precise details of the route that a mystery tour will take before be can run it is a prime example of regulation for regulation's sake. It is totally unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we may take the Parliamentary Secretary back to his schoolboy days in Nottingham. Would he not accept that at certain times of the year there are regular tours from Nottingham to Skegness to take Arthur Seaton and his girl friend—and no doubt many other people—there and back? Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one could reach the stage at which those tours were a form of direct competition, because of their regularity and predictability, with the express service? While following his philosophy that it is right to take away the controls on express services to expand the competition, does he not agree that before his explanation it seemed that the object was competition by way of express services, not competition by way of express services masquerading as tours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly the case. It is not a new discovery. In the summer, excursions and tours to seaside towns greatly increase in number. Undoubtedly there are some passengers who find that if they happen to have to make the journey for business reasons, they have a wider variety of methods available to them in the summer, but, that is the position now. Every summer there is a great outburst of trips and excursions to seaside towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Particularly Worthing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is correct. I fail to see how serious problems could arise. I also fail to see what relevance it would have to any problem for the excursion and tour operator to notify every trip to the traffic commissioners. I hope that my examples of what it would mean in reality persuade the Committee to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) asked me three specific questions. The first was how we check on whether an excursion or tour actually travels 30 miles from its point of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
origin. The answer is that as the operator does not have to notify it, the traffic commissioners do not have an immediate means of checking. That is an enforcement problem but, in my opinion, it is not a serious one. It depends on how many people will fail to apply for a road service licence when they are not going more than 30 miles away. Once it is suspected that someone is covertly competing with the stage carriages by going less than 30 miles it would not be difficult to step in and enforce it. It would be a curious form of competition because the operator would be dressing it up as a holiday trip and claiming to go more than 30 miles but secretly, no doubt as a result of a compact with his passengers, would go less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it will not be difficult to step in and enforce the law. To compete with a stage carriage service —this is the danger that the right hon. Gentleman foresees—I assume that an operator will have to tell his passengers Where they can get off. As he is competing with a stage carriage service, he will have to imply to his passengers that they can get off and stay at their destination. By the very nature of an excursion or tour, if the passengers buy a ticket it will bring them all the way back after visiting the illuminations at Blackpool or spending a day on the beach at wherever they are meant to go. The right hon. Gentleman is seeing fanciful enforcement problems. So I do not think there is any justification for the need to notify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of "excursion or tour" is at the root of the matter. Again, the right hon. Gentleman, with his usual diligence, has discovered the definition. The definition clause in this Bill is clause 35, and there one is referred to the transport Act 1968, which contains the involved definition that the right hon. Gentleman read out. As I pointed out to the right hon. Gentleman, when he commented on the inelegance of our drafting, Mrs. Barbara Castle did not do much better when she was in charge of transport legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that when we reach the appropriate stage in the Bill, some technical drafting amendments will need to be tabled to improve that wording. With the breakneck pace at which we are getting through this Bill, I do not know when that will be, but there will eventually be amendments. They will be technical and drafting amendments to improve the wording and take out some of the anomal-
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
ous references, but they will not change the substance of the definition of "excursion or tour".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the right hon. Gentleman that if he analyses that definition, he will arrive at a conclusion of the sort that I have indicated. It is not a scheduled service. It is not a service for which there is a licence, or for which a timetable is a condition of the service. It is one which essentially takes people roughly from one vicinity to another and back again to the starting point. We shall deal with the definition in detail when we reach clause 35, but I think that it will be found that the law will match common sense in the distinction between excursions or tours and express services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I was asked whether the very frequency of a tour and excursion arrangement would make it a scheduled service. My present understanding is that frequency has nothing necessarily to do with excursion or tour. We all know that many coach operators advertise that they do an excursion every Saturday to a set place. In practice, that does not give rise to any confusion about the nature of such an excursion to the Yorkshire Dales or the Peak District or anywhere else. The fact that the excursion is regular—perhaps even two or three a day at busy times—makes no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude—and I am prepared to repeat this argument on subsequent occasions to assist the Committee—by pointing out the areas where excursions and tours remain distinct from express services. The reasons are similar to those that I have already given for distinguishing between express services on the one hand and excursions and tours on the other. The reasons for continuing a distinction for excursions and tours are first, to relieve them from the need for notification; secondly for the purposes of clause 9, to give them, when they are going less than 30 miles, a quick and easy way of obtaining a road service licence where they are not competing with stage carriages; thirdly, for the purpose of new bus grants under clause 51, to make sure that they do not apply for those; and, finally, for fuel duty rebate, also found in clause 61, I have been helpful in having got up and clarified the distinctions, although it will merely enable the Opposition to table more amendments to cover exactly the same ground when we come to those clauses. Those are the only places in the Bill where there is need for a separate distinction for excursions and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>513</span>
tours and this distinction, like all the others, follows naturally when one grasps the essential difference between the two types of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 5, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and have been published by them in the prescribed manner.".</p></blockquote>
This is a minor addition to the provisions in the Bill for notification which I think could improve the efficiency of the reporting system which is provided for in (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that commissioners will have to publish applications for licences in the notices of proceedings which are now required under regulation 41 of the Public Service Vehicle Licensing Regulations 1952, although they are no longer covered by the 1952 regulation, but by section 160 of the Road Traffic Act 1960. So the power to make the regulation is still there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not proposing to change that aspect of section 160. They are proposing—I hope the Minister can confirm this—only to alter section 160 of the 1960 Act in so far as it has to be amended because of the new licensing and certification procedures which are laid down in the Bill. That is the presumption on which I am working. I have checked it and section 160 gives the Minister power to make regulations for a wide range of things. It is the regulation-making power for what was previously covered under the 1952 Act which led to regulation 41, which now governs the commissioners in printing notices of proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
that matters much. The definition in the 1968 Act is relevant and he has said that it may have to be changed. That is progress, but until it is changed the amendment is relevant. Finally, he has admitted that there is no control on the number of times the tour operator operated a tour without its ceasing to be a tour or excursion. For those reasons I feel that we must vote on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8</p>
	<p>Having said that, I must now say something to justify the clause which will probably gladden the hearts of Conservative Members.</p>
	<p>The commissioners are not infallible. With all their wisdom, great experience and knowledge of the transport systems in their own areas they may still receive notifications under this provision without grasping the full implications to the public or to some of the operators in the area.</p>
	<p>The amendment, therefore, seeks to require the commissioners to publish those notifications under the same procedure as they publish the applications for licences. That will give members of the public, or any local authorities and bus operators in the area who are sufficiently interested in these notifications, the opportunity to look at them. If there are implications which the commissioner should take into account, but appears not to have done so, it will be for those interested parties to point that out to the commissioner.</p>
	<p>This would also allow members of the public to make their own arrangements. If the commissioner decided that no action was required on his part all members of the local authority would be able, by access to the same notices, to take into account this information in making their own decisions.</p>
	<p>That is the aim and the legal basis of the amendment. I commend it to the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
Gentleman said, the effect of the amendment would be a requirement to publish all these notifications. I assume that the traffic commissioners, if they were so required, would publish them in notices and proceedings, in accordance with present practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the right hon. Gentleman's question about the regulation-making power which governs what is published by the traffic commissioners is yes, he is right. Section 160 of the 1960 Act is not being amended except in the ways he indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one must consider whether there is an advantage in requiring the traffic commissioners to add such notifications to what they already publish. I can see no advantage myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether members of the Committee have ever seen notices and proceedings as issued by traffic commissioners. They are the world's worst example of a governmental publication. There are pages and pages of notices of applications that have been made for minor variations of routes, fares, new licences, and so on. The need to publish these is one of the causes of delay in the traffic commissioners procedures, and a great deal of unwanted printed matter is regularly wished upon the world. In many ways I hope that the Bill will reduce the volume of material that has to go into notices and proceedings and makes what is left a more useful document. One is not anxious to place new obligations on the traffic commissioners, to give more work to the traffic offices, and put more material into that document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this amendment the commissioners are being asked to publish details of express services which in any case will be advertised to the general public. We are dealing with operators who want to set up long-distance inter-city, inter-town, express schedules time-tabled services. I know that the commercial acumen of bus operators varies from one to another, but there are few who set up such a service without advertising it prominently to bring it to the attention of as many people as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than have a requirement put on the commissioners to produce this endlessly boring document I prefer that people need only go the trouble of buying a time-table or telephoning the operator's ticket office to find out where and when the buses will run. I cannot believe that
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
anything published by the traffic commissioners will normally be looked up by members of the public, or potential passengers, as a means of finding out what express services are available, although it is possible that other operators and local authorities will find it a convenient way of getting information. But if we are not regulating such long-distance tours the occasions on which they would need to familiarise themselves with the details would be very limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find my hon. Friend's argument most persuasive. However, I should like to put one question to him. Presumably people would have a right to object to new express services and would also have the right to be notified that the new services are to be instituted. If there is no obligation to publish on the part of the commissioners, how will potential objectors know about any new services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that they have no right to object. We are dealing with express services which because all their passengers are carried more than 30 miles from their destination do not need a road service licence. In the past, the suggestion that such a service was proposed would have met a flood of objections. British Rail, bus companies and local authorities would line up and the whole matter would be delayed for months while they debated whether it was a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is called monopoly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is also called trade protection. Of course, it is also called other things, but often it is just a straightforward attempt to nobble a competitor who wants to provide a better service than is being provided. We have already stated that we do not believe that there is a need for a road service licence, and so competitors would be normally have a legitimate interest. No doubt they would want to know the timetable for the new service, but they could ring up the ticket office for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Services will be publicised to try to win custom. Therefore I see no reason to place an obligation on a public service to put into a formal document of notice and proceedings the details which it receives on notification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the problem. As the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) brought out, not only is there no right to object, but if the amendment is not carried there will be no legal means of publishing the information. It would be very helpful to local authorities, for other operators and perhaps for Members of Parliament to give commissioners such a right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that the information will be widely publicised. We are not concerned about the regular and legal operator but about the cowboy operator who may try to move in. We are not trying to legislate against the 99 per cent, who will operate legally. That is not the object of the exercise. If the traffic commissioner is given the right which the amendment seeks, it is one way of trapping the cowboy. Everything would have to be published. We are worried about those who will look for loopholes, and we believe that the amendment will help in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that I am tempted to take the Parliamentary Secretary to task for his legal descriptions, but he is wrong in calling this a new requirement. It is not new. It is necessary in present circumstances to make notification and to publish notices and proceedings. While the Parliamentary Secretary might regard notices and proceedings as endlessly boring, I can assure him that those with a deep concern about how network services are to be maintained in certain areas do not. They see them as anything but boring and believe that they have crucial importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be not only that the information would be published but that there would be a time lapse between the notification and the coming into effect of the service. I understand that the present procedure for notices and proceedings requires that a certain time should elapse between the notification and the start of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is a difference. To say that people can ring up the ticket office or look at the local paper or the bus company notice board and see that a service is being started is not the same as having the information in advance of the service starting and thus being able to take it into account in various ways or to make representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill were passed in its present form, some unhappy operator might well embrace the spirit of the Parliamentary Secretary's words and, assuming that he does not have to notify anybody in any way which will involve delay, might notify the commissioner on the day that the service begins. I understand that no time scale is laid down in the Bill such as there is for the notices and proceedings. If that is so the operator proposing to run the service may not have the advantage of the kind advice of somebody who has read the notices and proceedings with deep interest and sees some real practical difficulty in running the service. The operator is then obliged or committed to operate it if he works on the basis of the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to say that local authorities can ring up operators in the area. They will not know who will be operating there. They will not necessarily know who is coming in to run the express service until it begins. Once it is in operation, of course, they can go to the commissioner, who has had to be notified, and ask what information he has about the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) in his intervention is a serious one. Given that there are now no legal rights to objection, in some ways it becomes more important that the information should be there. Legally, one cannot change it. I am not now advancing the quarrel with the Minister as to whether there should be a legal right of objection. I am saying that, if there is something against which previously one could make objection legally but now one cannot, it may be more important that one should be informed. One may then seek to persuade, inform or advise people as to the effect of their intended action on an important public service. That may well be more important now than it was when there were clear legal rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal right has gone. The amendment does not seek to restore that right. It seeks to ensure that people who are properly interested in these services shall have the same ability to learn about them as they have in the case of other services where legal objections may be advanced. That is a clear and important point. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will clarify the time scale effect of the amendment, if carried, and that his hon. Friends,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
realising that there is no right of legal objection, will accept that the right of access to information about new express services in an area is of importance to those people who are deeply concerned about the maintenance and improvement of our public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may briefly add to what I said before and answer the points made by the two hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) says that he is concerned about cowboys. So far, he has failed to get across to me what in the notification he thinks will be of any use to anybody else or will be regarded as of much help against cowboys or anyone else. The traffic commissioners will be notified, largely in order to stress the commitment for someone setting out to run a scheduled service. I can think of only two aspects that the commissioners themselves would ordinarily look at in the notification. First, they would make sure that the person had an operator's licence. That is really the check that the Bill provides against cowboys. Secondly, they would make sure that the notified service did indeed take every passenger more than 30 miles from either the picking-up point or the setting-down point. Beyond that, for policy reasons which have been adequately debated—I could defend them again, but do not feel it necessary to reiterate them at this stage— we are not giving the traffic commissioner anything to do. Therefore, that, apart from possibly a few other odd points, is all that he has to check.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if local authorities or other operators decide that for some reason they find it easier to get details of the notifications if they are published in notices and proceedings, what will they do? They can only check the same things. Presumably the traffic commissioners will have already worked out the 30-mile point which will enable the route to qualify. They will also already have worked out that the man has an operator's licence. If they find that either of the conditions has not been met the man will immediately be told that he must apply for a road service licence before he can operate the service. Other than that, there is no normal problem that the local authority or other operators would face if they did not have the publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be rare occasions when the local authority or another operator might
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
for some reason have an interest in the details. But these are published, scheduled services. All they have to do is look up the timetable. For the sake of those rare occasions—of which I cannot for the moment think of a solitary example of any practical importance—it is not necessary to insist in every case that the details are published in the notices and proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat my previous remarks about that document. I hope that it will be improved in the near future. Under the present system it is of importance to those who receive it. But it is certainly not a good read, as I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will agree. It contains a great deal of stuff which in my opinion is of no earthly use to anyone. There are things which are necessary under the present law which will not be published once we have greatly simplified the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A set of logarithms is not a good read. But surely the Minister would not say that logarithmic tables should not be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not. I know that I am innumerate so that logarithmic tables mean nothing to me. I though that I was literate, but notices and proceedings puzzles me sometimes. As I said, it is at present of unusual and tedious length and detail. Nevertheless, notification without publication will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's final point concerned time. He thought that that might give rise to a need for publication. Certainly a notification should be given some time in advance of the service starting or a real cowboy could suddenly bung in a quick letter to the traffic commissioners and be running his bus before the commissioners found out the real nature of his business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as it stands contains the phrase "notified in the prescribed manner". We are not contemplating that "the prescribed manner" should entail undue formality. We do not wish to throw up a whole new rigmarole of detail. I would anticipate that when we come to prescribe the manner, about three weeks in advance of the start of the service would be the latest time for notification. The traffic commissioners would be given details certainly of the timetable and perhaps of the stopping places. They will have to be given a clear indication of where the 30-mile plus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
claim is being made in the described route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in mind that kind of notification, without undue formality. I believe that the publication of every one of the notifications would be an undue formality. For the reasons that I have given, in the new conditions created by not having road service licences for such services it is not necessary and serves no practical purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has still not given a satisfactory explanation for not accepting the amendment. It does not seem to have any terrifying consequences for the principles of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to make my mind hark rustily back to the time when in theory I learnt some economics. In this country everyone's economics starts off with a highly theoretical model of the free market system. I clearly recall that that model required on the part of all participants and all possible participants a perfect knowledge of the competition. If the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are advocating the other changes in the Bill, for the sake of sharpening up competition to the benefit of the customer, there is a clear case for publishing details of all such routes and services so that competitors who wish to come in can identify spots in terms of times, days of the week or routes that are not filled where they believe they can chuck in a new service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems rather churlish of the Parliamentary Secretary not to accept the amendment, which would not impose a terrifying burden on the traffic commissioners but would clearly be of service to all the organisations, whether established or would-be operators, that want to find out about the services being operated in the area in which they are interested. I can see no logical objection to that and my support for the amendment to some extent follows the principle to which the Minister subscribes and I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the free market situation of soap powder, as far as I am aware, there is no statutory duty upon a manufacturer of soap powder to give three weeks' notification to the Price Commission of an intention to raise the price, nor an obligation upon the Price Commission to publish a long and tedious document listing every such notifi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
cation received each month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed that things did not reach that stage when the Price Commission was in its full glory under the previous Government, but that would have nothing to do with competition. Such an arrangement would be a way of creating work for people to shove useless bits of paper around to each other. I fear that we would arrive at that position if the amendment were carried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose I set up as a non-cowboy, thoroughly respectable operator of express services. How do I discover what other services are in operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman's competitor is running a service and he cannot discover details of it or where its buses run from or to, he will be on a good wicket, because that bus operator will, in effect, be running a scheduled service secretly. That seems to be the sort of fear on which the amendment is based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) is planning to go into business I suspect that his chances of success will be pretty slim if his knowledge of market research is so limited that he will need to go to the Government or the traffic commissioners to discover who are his competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was attracted by the logic of the case put by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, but it seemed to lead us further along the road than the Bill has gone. At present, someone who plans to operate a new express service is under an obligation to notify certain information in a prescribed form to the traffic commissioners, who have to judge whether it is an express service and ascertain that he has an operator's licence. There is no obligation to publish that information and no right for anybody else to object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept my hon. Friend's logic in saying that therefore there is, no point in publishing that information, and I agree wholeheartedly with what he said about the turgid reading of the publications presently coming from the traffic commissioners. I should think that the only publication that could possibly be more turgid and boring is the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
I wish to pick up my hon. Friend's relevant point about the free market. I believe that the extension of express services will be one of the greatest benefits of the Bill. There is immense scope for greater service to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to ask my hon. Friend a question. Does it make sense for operators to have to notify the traffic commissioners that they are proposing a new express service? If they operate such a service and it is discovered that it does not comply with the law, they, like illegal taxi operators, will be operating illegally. Their competitors, or the official bus companies, will soon ensure that action is taken to find out whether it is a proper express service or whether it is a stage carriage. If it is shown that it is a stage carriage, clearly the operators would have needed a road service licence and they will be guilty of a serious offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we not leave it at that? Why not take out the obligation to notify the traffic commissioners, and make it subject to legal penalties if they operate without the appropriate licences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is arguing a tempting proposition. It is very tempting to say "We shall not require a road service licence. Why should the traffic commissioners be bothered with it?" As my hon. Friend says, if a person starts operating an illegal service, his competitors, local authorities and disaffected members of the public will soon take action. Competitors will soon discover when an operator is running under 30 miles or someone without an operator's licence has moved in. The time that passes before he is prosecuted is likely to be short. He will have committed a serious offence, and he will be stopped.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
	<p>port industry. Fear was expressed earlier by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) about the irresponsible cowboy who wants to have a go at running an express service although his commitment to it is very light. It is said that such an operator will advertise that he is to run a service of more than 30 miles, will run it for a couple of days, find out that he has overestimated the traffic, and immediately close down the service. Disappointed members of the public will turn up for the new service on the proposed third day of operation and find that no bus is running.</p>
	<p>For consumer protection reasons, to ensure that the business is being organised by a reputable person and legally, and to ensure also that the operator has a commitment to the service, we have decided to provide a requirement for notification. It is pretty small beer. It does not amount to much. In my view, the fears are fairly fanciful, and we have heard how fanciful they can be. If we removed the requirement, probably we should be descended on by people claiming that we were opening up the whole field to cowboys to rush in with their charabancs and vanish at a moment's notice. The burden placed on traffic commissioners and the amount of work and expenditure involved is slight.</p>
	<p>I have stressed my anxiety that the notification should be as informal as possible. When we consider the prescribed manner, I hope that we shall ensure in the regulations that it is a pretty informal process—probably just a letter giving notice of the operator's intention. In concession to the extraordinary propositions that are sometimes put forward about the dangers in this business, we might as well at least keep that requirement.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 is important. In fact, the first three clauses are all important contributions to the fundamental changes that the Minister has rightly claimed for the Bill. The debate on clause 3 has at least led us to understand a little more about that interpretation. The Parliamentary Secretary has made clear that the candles will be burning brightly again with further reflections on certain matters that have come out in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to make considerable changes in certain areas. Clause 3 in dealing with "stage carriage", "express carriage" and "contract carriage" defines those vehicles that will be used as public service vehicles, but for which road service licences will not necessarily be essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no doubt in the Committee—certainly on clause 3—whether local service relates to the fare stages, and we have been concerned about where the line should be drawn on what may be called the local fare stage services. In subsection (3) we have been concerned about where we draw the line on ending what may be considered to be local services—stage carriage services—and express carriage services or tours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first basic objection to the clause is that the controls are relaxed. Quite fairly, the Parliamentary Secretary said that the purpose of the Bill is to reduce the controls and set free the forces of competition. In this clause, as in clause 2, the measures are set forth for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major difference has been that we proposed that the line should be drawn at 50 miles rather than at 30 miles. The Parliamentary Secretary has given us a number of reasons both of economics and con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
venience. I believe that convenience was nearer to the forefront of his mind than was economics. It follows from the general philosophy in the Bill that a number of the restrictions will be removed. Competition will be allowed. It will no longer be necessary to apply for a licence, and conditions that, under the old legislation, could be laid down by the traffic commissioner will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case of the 30-mile criterion against the 50-mile criterion plays a substantial part in our argument. We have to give consideration to the professionals in transport operations. There is the danger—we tried to point out, at some expense to ourselves, the argument for 50 miles rather than 30 and the Parliamentary Secretary made clear that there was a balance to be drawn—that this may well reflect the vested interests of those putting the argument, and here the National Bus Company comes to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference to the correspondence and briefs from the Confederation of Passenger Transport—which is probably better known to Front Bench spokesmen on transport—shows that it is made up of public and private owners, so it is a broader mix than the National Bus Company, which may operate a number of services, or a local authority, which is much more involved in fare stage services and would be interested in asking the Government— as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out—to consider 15 miles rather than 30. I assume that that would be so that its members could compete against National Bus Company in certain areas, and one is aware of the argument there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confederation does at least reflect the broad mix of transport involved in express services, tour and fare stage passenger services, and is almost unanimous in its criticism of the 30 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to deploy some of those arguments during our debates so far on the Bill. We are convinced that the points put forward by the confederation as the operators—and strongly supported by the trade unions, incidentally, which commends consideration—are valid. Basically they are principles which, if the Bill is enacted, will come to the fore if our criticisms are valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main concern of anyone operating a bus service is that if we make it 30 miles in the clause we will underestimate the consequences of bus operations carried out at present under the traffic com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
missioners' system. Most bus companies operate a mix of transport services—some express, some fare stage, some tours. That has an important effect on the economics of the operation of a bus company. Those considerations are uppermost in the mind of the operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a mix of services, inevitably there is a mix of profitable returns from different types of service. The Parliamentary Secretary has said that possibly express services are an attraction and that is perhaps why there has been pressure to extend to 50 miles. That pressure was mentioned when we debated the interest in 50 miles of the National Bus Company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My thoughts turn to an inter-city service—and here I am reminded of the Minister's argument, when I saw him, about extending the high-speed rail system between Hull and London. I cannot go into that now, but there is an important point of principle that is relevant to this debate. The Parliamentary Secretary said then that it all depended on what the demand might be for an inter-city transport system between London and Hull. If we increase the availability of cheaper transport, albeit by road, the figures determining the investment in high-speed rail services will be greatly affected by that cheaper competition, and presumably will work against further investment in high-speed transport, particularly in areas such as Hull and London, which, in the Minister's view, are, to a certain extent, marginal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, it will be possible to operate an inter-city service because it is beyond the 30 miles. The balance of the share of these costs and advantage is a very important consideration to take into account in relation to bus operation. The operators tell us, quite fairly, that if we maintain the 30 miles they are likely to lose more of those services that are now profitable and they will not be used in cross-subsidising to reduce the proportion of costs now allocated to each bus where there is a mix. They will be lost as profitable services unless money comes from cross-subsidising to maintain other services provided by the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the operation will have less money for cross-subsidising with 30 miles than with 50 miles, will presumably lead to a judgment being made on whether the service should be maintained, particularly in rural areas, between A and B, with greater subsidies being required from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
local authorities. If cash limits are imposed on that, it can mean that the money is not available anyway, and the services will cease. In that sense, there will be a reduction in services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final, and fair, point made by the operators about the 30 miles is that they believe they do not compete on equal terms with other companies in the express and tour business. Their costs have to be balanced over a greater area. They will be carrying many more buses operating at half capacity. All those arguments have been heard in Committee and I shall not go into detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to an important point made by the hon. Member for Faversham, who asked whether it was necessary to advise the public that an appeal could be made against the notice given to the traffic commissioners that a person intended to continue an express service. The clause makes clear that an operator wanting to run an express service must ensure that passengers make at least a 30-mile journey on the vehicle. Many of us in the Opposition are far from convinced of the enforceability of the 30-mile limit. The driver of the bus could be placed in a very difficult position. If a passenger wants to get off the bus a mile before his 30 miles is reached, at one of the range of stops on that service, the driver will be under strong and unfair pressure to decide whether to allow the passenger to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary assured us that it is for the operator to ensure that these conditions are met. If it could be proved that an express service operator was in breach of the requirement not to allow anyone to get off the bus who has travelled less than 30 miles, except in an emergency, I presume that the only sanction is to remove his operator's licence—presumably such a licence will be required to operate an express service. One hopes that pressure is not put on the driver, or that he will be told "You made the mistake. You are to blame".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see what will happen. Drivers will co-operate. There will be pressure on the driver, perhaps on a regular service when someone he knows is using the cheap regular service from point A to B, to drop a passenger off at a certain stop. We will then see the weakness and fallacy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
of control by determining an arbitrary 30-mile limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham was on a strong point, which the Opposition have pressed. If an express service operator decides to run a service from A to B, he is only required to notify the commissioner that he intends to do so. That, as I understand it, was called the principle of commitment. But I assume that that commitment meant that the operator would have to observe it through thick and thin. What are the rights of anyone who wants to protest against a proposed service, as can be done at present? If an operator proposes to run a service between A and B, irrespective of whether it is 30 miles or 50 miles—a different interpretation now exists on the use of express services—an appeal can be made. Indeed, the traffic commissioner is under an obligation to take that into account under existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what is the position if one knows that a service was being run with which one disagreed because it could undermine an existing service in the area? To be fair, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the argument when we debated the difference between the excursion and the express bus in the same 30-mile area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An express bus company may operate over the 30-mile limit—up to 50 miles. At the moment, the driver can drop anybody off provided they have travelled a minimum of 30 miles. If the distance was, say, 70 miles and he had started from Leeds where all the passengers had joined the bus, passengers could, presumably, be dropped off beyond the 30 miles. Perhaps I am wrong, but I am, so to speak, thinking on my feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be a bus service starting from London going via the motorway to Nottingham, Leicester, and Leeds with set downs in all those towns. In fact, the bus could stop every 100 yards, provided nobody was being set down who had not travelled at least 30 miles. All the passengers would need to have travelled from London. Once the bus commences stopping beyond the 30 miles, the driver can set down the passengers where he likes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am giving hon. Gentlemen considerable latitude, but many of the arguments now being used have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
raised on the amendments to the clause. The general intention of a clause stand part debate is to discuss the general philosophy of the clause and not repeat arguments that have already been debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that ruling, Mr. Dean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the bus is travelling over 30 miles, that means that it could be dropping off passengers at villages on the route. Therefore, a regular operator applying to run a service may well find that he is requested to use dropping off areas that were not profitable for a normal bus operator. He would be in competition with the tour operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary made clear that there is an obligation on operators to provide services. The clause does not place such an obligation on an operator who puts forward a notice to the traffic commissioners that he is to run an express service. If he fails to produce the promised service of, say, three times a week, but decided to reduce the service to that of the tour operator competing against him, there is no sanction whatsoever. There is no obligation. The notice is solely an intention of what he would like to do, but there is nothing that can be done if he fails to complete the service. That does not, I am sure, apply to British Rail which, if it advertised a service, would have an obligation to provide an alternative service if it failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore strongly oppose the clause. We believe that it will contribute to the undermining of an integrated public transport system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. May I put a point which may help us in our deliberations? The construction of the Bill is such that, in order to determine what is one certain type of public service vehicle—namely, the contract carriage—one has to read clause 2, because there is a slight controlling factor in subsection (2) of clause 3 and a controlling factor in clause 3(5) and schedule 1. Therefore, if we wish for a broad discussion about what should be a proper scope for contract carriage or how contract carriage vehicles should relate to other vehicles, there can be some doubt as to the appropriate point at which to raise these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to you, Mr. Dean, that it might be for the convenience of the Committee and for understanding on both sides if we

	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
were to reserve argument on that until we come to debate schedule 1 as a whole, when all the controlling factors in the Bill will have been covered to the extent that they are covered by amendments. It would then be clear to all members of the Committee what points were not covered by amendments and what remained to be debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Dean. I support what was said by the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Dean, that I will certainly be confining myself to the general philosophy of the clause because I would not even claim to understand its technicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading the Minister said
	<br><blockquote><p>"So in putting the user first in passenger transport this Government have checked and examined the restrictions and barriers which stand in the way of new services developing and new operators coming forward."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some parts of the country—notably some of the rural areas—have clearly inadequate passenger services."</p></blockquote>
He also went on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"It means that there will be free competition between operators who want to run inter-city coach services between our major cities—London to Manchester or Birmingham or Exeter."</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol 974, cc. 1120–1122]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That displays the faulty logic of the whole of clause 3 because it is a fact that, despite any restrictions that presently apply, express coach services have been, and are, expanding, as have tours and excursions. It is the stage carriage services in rural areas that have not been expanding. That applies to British Rail, whose inter-city
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
services are extremely prosperous; its efficiency, timing and number of trains on major routes have expanded while the rural routes are in danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophy behind the clause is that the removal of restrictions and the creation of a free market will automatically bring about an improved service. If that is the case and we look at the areas in most need of an improvement in services, the relaxation of controls will apply least in those areas—that is, on stage carriage services and stage carriage services in rural areas. Contrary to that, the biggest derestriction will apply in the area of express services, tours and excursions, where major expansion already goes on. Therefore, if the Minister and his hon. Friends have any faith in their philosophy that the creation of a free market will bring about benefit to passengers, they have the whoe of the clause the wrong way around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even allowing for cross-subsidisation, if they have faith in that philosophy, as they maintained during Second Reading and which they have called forth from time to time on this and earlier clauses of the Bill, they ought to be quite happy to keep the restrictions on the express services—which are expanding in spite of the restrictions which apply at present— and they ought to be throwing away and making the famous bonfire of controls on those services provided in the rural areas. According to the theory that has been put forward, that would immediately release the pent-up and frustrated intentions and energies of all sorts of private entrepreneurs and operators who will race around the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to observe that Government Members seem to be supporting my views. However, if they vote for the clause they will be flying in the face of that approbation. Restrictions of a sort will be retained on those services where at present there is no apparent demand by operators for the introduction of new services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was maintained on Second Reading and since, and in the Minister's public speeches, was that there is a pent-up demand to provide services. However, there seems precious little evidence of such a demand to provide services for rural areas, whereas there is a slight demand for those areas where services are already best —that is, the most frequent, the speediest,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
the most convenient, and probably running between sheltered bus stations in major cities rather than from exposed little poles saying "Bus stop" in the middle of a rural area. In the philosophy of the clause, the whole burden of change is concentrated on the wrong areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister that, if they have faith in the view that the release of free market forces will automatically benefit people, it is the rural areas which most need that. But the problem is that the Government do not believe it, despite all their platitudes about getting rid of the barriers to the development of new services, and about new operators who will come forward. They tell people in rural constituencies that this is the correct way forward and that this wondrous Bill and its clause 3 will put things on the right track. There certainly will be tracks in some rural areas. So little traffic will use the roads and so little will be spent by counties on maintaining them that roads will turn back into the tracks that they once were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary publicly shy away from accepting the fact, the whole drift of clause 3 shows that they accept that services in rural areas will benefit scarcely at all from any increase in competition. Such an increase will be only in express services, and in those circumstances rural services will continue to need to be cross-subsidised from the more prosperous longer distance services of existing major operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having gone that far in accepting that rural services will need cross-subsidisation within the industry, as well as the grants provided by central Government via county councils to help in the provision of non-paying services, the Government's measures in relation to relaxation of controls on express services and the setting of a low mileage limit of 30 miles—rather than the 50 miles that we suggested, beyond which express services would, in effect, be de-licensed—have, in the view of major bus operators, including the National Bus Company and large independent operators, meant that they expect to see a substantial proportion of their profits from the express services disappear. Consequently, there will be less money available to the bus companies—whether publicly or privately owned—to cross-subsidise rural services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a likely consequence of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
clause. As a result, I believe that rural bus services—which everyone recognises as most in need of being promoted and assisted, and given a leg-up—will suffer, whereas the express services, which are already doing rather well, will have even more traffic on their routes. If the Minister does not accept that he is rejecting the logic of his Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not see ourselves as representing the management of the National Bus Company or any other operator. Once the Bill becomes law, it seems fairly predictable that in an effort to maximise its profits the company will start to concentrate its attention on express services. It will be one of the major competitors on those, because it will be able to make more money from those than from rural services. With such restrictions on control, it seems likely that the National Bus Company and other large operators will tend to devote more effort and vehicles to express services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to describe as a matter of acute crisis the inadequate bus and stage carriage services in the rural areas. However, I am sure that he will express pleasure at some recent news from my constituency, even though it runs contrary to the thesis that he is developing. The National Bus Company has withdrawn services from a whole range of villages—one can imagine the consternation which that caused—only to see them replaced by a small private operator. The firm is also under contract to the county council, but at less cost than the NBC and it is offering just as good a service and, in fact, giving employment to some bus drivers who would otherwise have lost their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be a desirable development. However, unless I misheard the hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
private operators are subsidised. Nevertheless, the change was possible under existing legislation. It was possible, of course, only because of the subsidy to both the public and private sector operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The importance of my point is that the philosophy of despair constantly enunciated by the Opposition is not founded on fact. As services are withdrawn, other operators can in certain circumstances be included to take them up. Even if the National Bus Company should withdraw from some areas because it is tempted into the more profitable sphere of express services, it does not follow that other areas will be deprived of a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the county councils and private operators will be able to generate new, and possibly better, services and bus facilities for rural areas. At present those services are declining. In my view, this general philosophy could offer considerable improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to come back to the point raised by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate).

In any big town one can at present get an express bus to almost any other big town. That is where the relaxations are being concentrated. Yet the hon. Member is saying that the present system is quite reasonable and that there has not been a major decline in rural transport, in rural stage carriage services. However, there has indeed been a major decline. More needs to be done about it, but what I am saying is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are beginning to stray somewhat. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the clause is about the classification of public service vehicles and not about the adequacy or otherwise

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish—I am sure that it will be a relief to all members of the Committee if I sit down—by trying to crystallise the point. If relaxation of control is the answer, the relaxations are being introduced in those areas which at present are best bussed. They are being least pushed forward in those areas which are worst bussed. As a result, more and more resources will be concentrated on those areas which at present have the best bus services, and fewer and fewer resources will be concentrated by the bus industry— I emphasise the bus industry—on those areas which now get the fewest resources. The only answer to the problem, whether through public ownership, private ownership or any form of licensing, is a much more substantial degree of public subsidy, such as the subsidy which is provided by the South Yorkshire county council in both the rural and urban areas of that county, to the immense benefit of the people living there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I say that it is a pity, I do not mean that personally. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will now tell the Minister. May I also tell you, Mr. Dean, that I do not need the Minister to tell me whether he is paired. There is a Whip who does the job admirably. It is a pity that the Minister is replying, because the points I wish to make arise from some of the answers made by his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to debates on amendments which have been taken earlier today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) saw some inconsistency between the Bill and what he described as the freedom of the market. I see some inconsistency between the Bill—particularly the clause, with its classification of express services and the vehicles engaged thereon—and individual freedom. In replying to debates on earlier amendments, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned several times that penalties would be imposed on the organiser of an express service if he allowed passengers to alight before they had done a journey of 30 miles. I believe that that is a summary of his position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a matter for the organiser of the express service if people alight from his vehicle. There is such a thing as individual freedom. It is also a matter for the passengers as to when they wish to get off the bus. It is a bit thick to tell someone that, although the bus has stopped, he must not get off it. The mind boggles at the prospect of some of the arguments that will ensue. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is sensible to allow the operators of express services to stop in several places in a city for the convenience of passengers, rather than to restrict them to stopping at a garage in the centre of the city. They should be allowed to stop in the suburbs to pick people up and, presumably, to allow people to alight, so long as they have already come 30 miles. People may well wish to go from town A to town B, to stay on the bus until it gets beyond the centre of town B and to alight from the bus in the suburbs. There is nothing wrong with that. But people who wish to alight in the suburbs may also have got on the bus in the centre of the town or city.
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
Are we saying that the organiser, or the bus driver, will actually stop people who wish to get off the bus from doing so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important point. I have some experience of the matter, although not the kind of experience related earlier today by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South from his boyhood near York. I have experience on the other side, experience of running buses. There is a problem when passengers insist that the bus driver stops to let them off the bus. There are ways of insisting. Buses have means of communicating if there is an emergency. The instruction is usually to ring the bell a certain number of times. I can assure Ministers from my own experience that passengers sometimes avail themselves of that facility when all that they wish to do is to stop somewhere which is not a bus stop. That is likely to happen more frequently when they are otherwise likely to be taken not just to the next bus stop but to the next town or city. People will claim that there is an emergency when there is no such thing. The driver will have to stop to investigate, and the people will get off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary referred to bus drivers being bullied. That is more serious. I think that he was a little flippant, perhaps because of my hon. Friend's description of a group of boys. But it is a serious problem. In the city of Birmingham, for example, and probably in other cities, too, there has been a growing incidence of assaults on bus drivers. Serious injuries have been inflicted on drivers of ordinary stage services. I can imagine express services going through the centre of a city and picking up someone who in ignorance or through malicious design has got on the bus intending to get off in the suburbs, especially at night after the pubs close. That will lead to assaults on bus drivers who do not wish to stop. The Bill might well provide encouragement, to some slight extent. Will the Minister tell us what will happen if passengers insist on getting off the bus? The Parliamentary Secretary has assured us that no penalty will be imposed upon drivers for such trivial incidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that there is a regular arrangement to stop. The Parliamentary Secretary described the penalties that would be imposed upon the operators of the service. But such an arrangement might be made without their knowledge, between the passengers and the driver. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
some cases, money might change hands to induce a bus driver to let a passenger off before he has gone 30 miles. It may be for that passenger's convenience to have rapid transport to work on a regular basis, or something of that kind. Will penalties be imposed only upon the operators, or will some penalty be imposed upon drivers who come to collusive arrangements with passengers?

Secondly, perhaps the Minister could expand on the interesting point raised by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), who asked why one should have to go through the rigmarole of applying and prescribing particulars of the service in order to be allowed to run an express service. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary said that he thought that a letter from the operator to the traffic commissioners might be sufficient. One wonders what would be the point of such a letter in those circumstances. The Parliamentary Secretary said that it was evidence of a commitment to provide the service. But I wonder whether in some cases people will bother to write a letter to the traffic commissioners in those terms, especially when they can escape any need to communicate anything at all. It cannot just be a letter, of course, because other parts of the Bill— and, indeed, the notes on clauses—make it clear that the operator would have to provide details of the timetable, the fares and so on. So a simple letter saying that the person intends to run an express service from A to B will not be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that situation, what happens if the operators decide to call their services excursions or tours? Earlier today, the Parliamentary Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) were talking about excursions from Barrow to Blackpool. But one can also run excursions into cities, as my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South described. Indeed, a very common excursion from Birmingham or Manchester would be to London. Such an excursion is very attractive not only to the passengers but also to the operator. What is to stop operators from running inter-city services from provincial cities to London and calling them excursions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires that excursions should be return journeys. Simply to go from Birmingham to London is not an excursion. The passenger has to go back as well. Presumably, he has to have a return ticket. But there could be ways round that.
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
Indeed, many people coming from Birmingham to London actually want to go back to Birmingham. I will not go into all the reasons for that, but they frequently wish to go back. If an operator does not want to go through the rigmarole of writing a letter to the traffic commissioners and perhaps being questioned about it, but merely wishes to test the water, what is to stop him from calling his service an excursion inter-city? I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's own policy document of 1979, in paragraphs 9 and 10 with regard to the stage carriage network, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There could be a risk of loss of service if licensing were immediately removed. More needs to be known first of the effects of increased competition on networks. Local bus services will therefore still require road service licences."</p></blockquote>
Yet we are now told by almost all the operators throughout the country that the distance of 30 miles now specified in the Bill will not be sufficient to ensure that local bus services are adequately protected in accordance with the Minister's own intention as spelt out in those paragraphs. How does the Minister intend to carry out that original intention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many rural services depend upon the highly complex system of cross-subsidisation now in operation. The hon. Member for Faversham suggested that new operators would be able to employ bus drivers who might lose their lobs if present operators cut back on their services. I fear that that would not be the case. New operators would come in only to make a profit. It is therefore unlikely that they would employ redundant bus drivers. They would be far more likely to employ part-time or casual-labour or moonlighters, as they are called in the industry. In many rural areas, small bus depots are a major source of employment, not only of bus drivers but also of maintenance, clerical and cleaning staff. Moreover, for many of them the balance between continuing in existence and closing down is a very delicate one. The withdrawal even of one or two buses in a small depot of a dozen or so vehicles could make the difference between the company keeping the depot open and deciding to close it. I fear that that will be another effect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis) raised the important question of enforcement of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
the 30-mile limit from the point of view of the driver or conductor. He and I are probably the only members of the Committee actually to have worked on a public service vehicle. We are probably both aware, therefore, of how difficult it is to enforce regulations and how serious the problem of violence and assault upon bus crews now is. Indeed, the garage where I worked was unfortunate enough to have one conductor murdered while conducting his vehicle in Glasgow. That was in 1969, and it is probable that the number of assaults on bus crews is increasing every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore wonder how the limit can be enforced. To be honest, it would have been equally difficult for drivers to operate the 50-mile limit proposed in our earlier amendment if people wanted to get off before they had travelled that distance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. As my hon. Friend has said, the situation is becoming extremely difficult for bus operators. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which is now before the House, will apply penalties to the drivers of contract vehicles, making them liable to a £200 fine if they allow people to carry alcohol on board the vehicle when going to a sporting event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how that can be enforced in some parts of the country. Does the Minister wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making inquiries about the nature of the legislation. I will inquire of the Minister concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I have said is therefore a further indication of a part of the Bill which is unworkable in reality. In that respect, it has much in common with those discussed in our earlier debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem in essence is that the clause does nothing to improve the transport situation, and it affects areas where most transport services are fairly
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
lucrative at present. Indeed, most transport undertakings use this lucrative area to cross-subsidise rural lines. That is the great problem. The hon. Member opposite who talked about loosening controls was perfectly correct. The clause does loosen controls, but it loosens controls without imposing any responsibility. Our remarks about cross-subsidisation were pooh-poohed by members on the Government side as though this were something that the Opposition had dreamed up. In order to allay that fear, and to put it in context, I cannot do better than to sum up the clause with this quotation from an organisation which can hardly be classified as a supporter of this side of the Committee— namely, the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which is hardly Labour-inspired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last three paragraphs of the letter condense the confederation's feelings about the clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister of Transport believes new privately operated services will appear after his Transport Act."</p></blockquote>
The Minister does believe that. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is not the view of most private operators, though no doubt some will take on services, often—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An Hon. Member</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The professionals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the professionals who are doing the job. The crucial point in the paragraph—this is what the clause is about—is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Will this add to service?" Well, look at the corner shop, no licence control there; what has happened to most of them since the supermarkets came on the scene? The market favours the strong."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Others"—</p></blockquote>
this is appropriate to the Minister himself who referred to the next remark on Second Reading—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are looking for a Laker of the bus lines. We all admire swashbuckling Sir Freddie"—</p></blockquote>
—this is the key point
	<br><blockquote><p>"but ask British Airways why they are abandoning 20 domestic air routes."</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the professionals, not the people who sit in Committees and talk about things. These are the people who actually operate the services. What will happen to our bus and coach services is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
that there will be strong competition on main routes at the expense of the network and the public. That is exactly what the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confederation warns the public of the dangers. That is precisely what we on this side have tried to do. It will not take the blame, which is being put squarely on the Minister's shoulders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These people operate a service. The clause loosens control and allows people to compete in the more lucrative sectors of transport. If the clause is carried, can anyone seriously visualise the rush of people who want to take up those rural lines that do not pay now? If they can, they should say so now. What will happen is that because we have created the lucrative lines there will not be a rush to rural routes. There will be a rush away from rural routes because everybody will want to be in on the act on the lucrative lines. This is the trouble with the clause. I agree with the quotation from the gentleman from the confederation, whom I do not know but who speaks lucidly— he is a professional; that is the point; he knows what he is doing every day of his life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point. The clause takes away from the traffic commissioners something which ought to remain with them by the omission of the words "excursions and tours". One is not worried only about fares. Under existing legislation, the traffic commissioner had a duty not to worry about the fares but to examine the route. By omitting those words from the clause we take away from the traffic commissioner the ability to examine the routes of excursions and tours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having taken that away, who then examines the route? Under present legislation, the traffic commissioner, because it is included in his remit, undertakes to look after the suitability of the routes on which services are provided, and that includes excursions and tours. But that ability is being taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—I do not want to go on too long, and I am sure that the Committee will be grateful for that—the clause does nothing other than put the public in rural areas at grave risk of having no services at all. We heard from the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) about someone moving in and providing a service after the National Bus Company had closed down. I have news for the hon. Gentleman —that is one area where this has happened,
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
but there are numerous areas. Under Beeching we heard that when the railways closed all these people would move in to provide services, but that did not happen. One area can be quoted, but there are a number of areas where, without subsidisation, there will be no service whatever and the clause will lead to a speeding-up of that process so that complete communities will be without transport because everyone will be rushing to secure the lucrative part of the business and nobody will operate where there is no money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that, as we have dealt with three clauses, we might be establishing something of a precedent in our way of dealing with the Bill. Each of the three clauses that we have debated has been different at its end from its beginning, because amendments have been carried, sometimes on the proposition of the Government and sometimes on that of the Opposition. The Opposition have been trying to help the Government to state their aims more effectively in the Bill in a number of cases. We see that as part of our wider duty. We also see it as part of our wider duty to try to get some clarity into parts of the Bill. The clause has provided us with a superb example. The Government have not stated their intention clearly and they have carried an amendment which, in fairness to them, brings about a clarity that did not exist before and solves a problem which both Government and Opposition identified, namely, that the definition in the Bill makes it possible for a journey made in one direction to be an express and in another direction to be a stage carriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Chair this morning, Mr. English ruled very clearly and firmly that, since the group of amendments on that area that we discussed dealt with the question of how one defines "express" and what distance should be contained in the definition, we should not at that stage deal with other implications for the running of the service which arose from that, that in particular, we should not speak about fares. Therefore, it is not surprising, Mr. Dean, that some of my hon. Friends are speaking about the fares effects of the clause on clause stand part. I certainly intend to follow their example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I do so, however, I want to explain to the Minister the result of my reflection between 1 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. on this morning's debate. As the Minister has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
no doubt been informed by the Parliamentary Secretary, we had a somewhat difficult and complex debate in which we tended to concentrate rather seriously on the problem of definition between running an express one way and a stage carriage another. Although my hon. Friends and I did not vote for that definition, I believe that the Committee was able to achieve a legal clarity which avoids that difficulty and, in so doing we created the most enormous practical problem. There is now no doubt that one can state in two sentences what is the meaning of that particular part of the clause defining an express service. As Mr. English said this morning, we certainly could not do that at the outset, but now it is quite possible. We owe this in no small measure to the explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary. However, the clarity is such that it raises a practical problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to state the clear position which has emerged, as I understand it, from reading the Government amendment and this morning's debate. It is that one can run an express service in this country subject to meeting one or both of two conditions—first, that no passenger getting on to the bus alights without having travelled 30 miles as the crow flies; and, secondly, that the passenger has travelled at least 30 miles along the route from the point at which he started to the point at which he alights. That is a very clear position in law and there would be no difficulty in the courts in testing an action brought on the basis that some operator had breached that condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts are not under the same restrictions as we are in this Committee. It would be possible to put up a large scale map in court and say "Here is where the complaining passenger got on, and here is where he got off", to set up a big compass representing 30 miles of scale and strike two arcs. The area covered by the intersection of the two arcs would be the area which would have to be unable to contain the route. That would be the condition. Provided the route went outside the area bounded by those two arcs, the operator could contend that it did not matter that the passenger had started at one point and finished at another that was not 30 miles away, and he would still have complied with the conditions of this definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
entirely agrees with me and I hope that he will also agree that it is a great pity that I did not rely this morning on my training as an engineering and design draughtsman and seek to rely on experience of parliamentary debate to deal with this matter. To a draughtsman, of course, it is a simple matter if he can see two arcs struck from two points and the area contained with the intersections of the two arcs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a situation that is beautifully clear and precise and of such a form that in court the lawyers—with a little advice from draughtsmen if they have no concept of geometry, although I do not imagine that there are many such lawyers—could demonstrate without a shadow of doubt that it was either within or outwith this definition. So it is superbly simple and clear and to that extent a certain objective that the Committee should have in mind has been achieved. However, the trouble is that it is totally impractical for the operators. How can an operator who is planning an express service reasonably be expected to draw his route upon the map and then work out where he can let passengers get on and get off, bearing in mind that after the first 30-mile check has been made he can have stops at any intervals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give a simple and straightforward example, even if one had a route which ran in an absolutely straight line—a very unlikely possibility—that route could have stops which were at 29 miles or 1,759 yards from the first to the second stops and thereafter at 5 miles, 10 miles and 20 miles intervals. That would not matter. It would still theoretically be possible within the scope of such a route to operate within the definition now in the Bill. But, on testing that, I ask hon. Members just to imagine that multiplicity of arcs that would have to be drawn upon the map if the route was realistic and practical and not one that ran along a theoretical straight line. Of course, it would be darn nigh impossible even to work that out as a routing and scheduling provision that one had to send to the commissioner. In reality, routes bend and take all sorts of turns. The operator who had problems of that sort might find that he would have to alter his route, to add a little to it so that it went outside that beautiful geometrically shaped area that was brought about by the intersection of the two arcs so that he could ensure in a certain case that someone had travelled more than 30 miles from the point at which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
he got on to the point at which he alighted. So I suggest that in this clause stand part debate we should appeal to the Minister to have further reflection before Report on whether we have got this definition light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the definition is clear, and that if a case were brought to the courts the matter could be settled there. But I suggest that there is a practical nonsense, even in terms of routing, which operators will find very difficult. I make no mention of how people with other network responsibilities will look at the definition, but they, too, will have problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reach the Report stage of the Bill, I suggest that the Minister may have reflected and decided that it might be much simpler if he defined an express service as one in which there is a straightforward distance between each of the stops. That might make for a more logical form of route planning for express operators and a much simpler arrangement for passengers to understand. How could a passenger understand whether he was in a legally defined express service—or, for that matter, the bus conductor, or the bus driver? I suppose that it might be possible to display the map in the bus and to hand to each passenger entering the bus a piece of celluloid with these two arcs set to the scale and ask him to go and set it against the map so that one point of the arc was struck was at the place where he got on and to check whether the other place was within the area of arc and, if so, whether the route he was taking was outside. I do not believe that that is a practical proposition. No bus company would do that. So the matter should be examined again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have raised another problem which can be overcome only if further thought is given to this question. I doubt very much whether the definition is within the practical limits of a one-man operation bus, anyway. It is asking too much of a man driving a bus to make sure, in letting people on and off, that he is complying with the definition. If he fails to do so, it is hardly reasonable to hold him responsible, or his employer, on a charge of running a stage coach service under express bus provisions. That is not on. It would require, at the very least, a very able conductor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it would offend what I take to be the wishes of a number of Conservative Members. I hope that I am not misrepresenting them. I have listened
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
carefully to their arguments. But what Conservative Members have said could be taken to mean that they want a range of possibilities opened up to passengers within the bus transport system. They would not think it wrong if a passenger standing at a stop at which an express and a stage carriage bus stopped weighed up for himself the difference between the cost of going on the express and the cost of going on the stage carriage over a certain distance. If he decided that because the extra cost of going on the express was worth it, knowing that the express would stop somewhere well short of 30 miles, he should get on the express, pay the fare which would carry him 30 miles, and hop off after 10 miles, they would not think it wrong. That would be much cheaper than going by taxi.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand Conservative Members aright, they want that sort of flexibility or option. But it cannot exist legally under the definition in the Bill. So that is yet another reason for reconsidering the definition. Moreover, if a conductor in those circumstances, meeting that passenger—I hope a not too hypothetical passenger, as has been demonstrated by two of my hon. Friends who have some experience of working on public transport vehicles—says to the passenger "I cannot let you off. I sympathise with you, but I cannot let you off otherwise I shall be breaking the law", the conductor would become very unpopular and would be put in an impossible position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of those who observe with great interest the conduct of conductors. I believe that there is a strong case for paying conductors a lot of money and being very selective about those whom we allow to be conductors. When I travel by bus, particularly late at night, in some of our major cities, I notice that there are some conductors who are extremely able and who perform the highest possible public service. They seem to be able to anticipate the difficulties that might arise, and with a few words here and a gesture there they manage to avoid all sorts of difficulties. There are other conductors who do not have that ability; and to travel on their buses is not a very pleasant experience. I say "their buses" because they do conduct the operation and ensure that the service is pleasant and effective. In my view, the provision seeks to impose upon conductors a quite unreasonable requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
In the course of the debate, the Minister said that one of the objections to the sort of amendment we tabled in relation to the stage carriage and the express carriage running over the same route arose from the fact that the same bus company may be running the same service. I accept that. It is quite possible that the same company will be running the express and the stage carriage over the same route. But that happens now. There is nothing to stop it from happening. But where it happens, there are certain checks and safeguards which operate in the public interest and which would not operate if the Bill were passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make clear what I have in mind. My first point is one that I think will appeal to Conservative Members. If the same operator is running an express and a stage carriage on the same route, he must believe that there is a commercial validity for doing that. He must think that he is making at least as much—or more— money by operating the express and stage coach on the same route as if he only ran one. So, if he is doing that, unsubsidised of course, it has a commercial validity. But as a check on the public interest in whether that should operate, as of now that operator has to persuade the traffic commissioner that by running two services on the same route he is not doing something that is detrimental to the public interest, and that he is not doubling fares in order to offer some superior service to those who go end to end to the detriment of those who are on the stopping service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is no problem in having the same operator. If another operator seeks to come in, that operator argues the same case with the traffic commissioner, and the traffic commissioner can come to a decision on that issue. There is no difficulty there. That public safeguard is vested in the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In understand that some Conservative Members have an almost pathological objection to control by traffic commissioners. So I do not found the argument solely on the particular form of check. But, even if we abolished traffic commissioners, it would still be necessary to impose somewhere within the transport legislation some form of appeal or tribunal or check to make sure that in the development of such services, nothing took place which would offend the public interest. Unless one did that, on the basis
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
of experience in this country and more recent experience in other countries, there could be a collapse of the services. We could pay dearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has fair implications. If one takes part of the control of the buses run over these routes, namely, only the express operation over the route—this is what is proposed in the Bill—out of the hands of the commissioner, but leaves in his hands the control of the stage carriage, it raises the question of how the commissioner can operate on the grounds proposed by the Bill. Accepting, for the sake of this argument, that the new criteria were perfectly acceptable, and given that express services, as arrived at by definition in the clause are the ones that will operate, how will the commissioner judge whether it is in the public interest? He has no power to stop the express service operator from coming in on the route. That is what the Government are driving at. So, when other operators, who are required to make application, do so, how is the commissioner to decide whether their operation is in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the factors that have to be taken into account are how frequently the express services will stop, what other operators should be able to come in, and on what terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest seriously to the Committee that, if that commissioner decides that the express carriage on the route is nowhere near to meeting the overall route requirements of the passengers, in the public interest he will have to grant considerable increases in fares to the stage carriage operator on that route in order that the stage carriage operator can carry the balance of passengers who cannot be covered by the express operators. Therefore, by accepting the Government amendment as we have done today, we threaten a massive increase in fares on certain routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have dealt with the cross-subsidy implications, so I do not want to go further into that now, other than to say that I agree 100 per cent. with what they have said. Part of the money that now comes in on the routes and services that are checked by traffic commissioners makes a contribution by way of cross-subsidy to maintaining many other services, including rural ones, about which members of the Committee should be concerned. I include in that the Liberal Member on the Committee who is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
here today to examine the implications of the clause on the services about which he professes considerable concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if one could leave that aside, what the Government are seeking to achieve here may well—let us be fair to their argument— result in more express services running on particular routes. It may even result—I grant this to the Minister—in a lowering of the fares initially. With many more operators competing to get in on the routes it may be that, so as to compete effectively, operators will offer lower fares than are at present charged. That may well be the outcome. But I suggest that, if that is so, there will be a heavy price to pay for that initial drop in fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a price to pay in terms of loss of local authority planning of transport schemes. I forecast this. I do not often engage in prophesy, but I shall attempt it here. If this provision is agreed in this form and there is no radical change elsewhere in the Bill, we shall be confronted with a situation in which local authorities, with responsibility for trying to plan the bus network cover of their areas, will find that bus companies will not be prepared to talk to them about the express operations running through their areas. Bus companies will say "They are in a different category. We have only to notify the commission about them. We have to compete in a different way in those areas. We cannot make revenue in those areas as we can in other areas, and, therefore, we cannot have a realistic discussion about the transport support grant implications of such services."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first of three losses that I believe we shall have to sustain for the doubtful gain of having an initial drop in fares. The second loss has been outlined by my hon. Friend so I do not need to go over it. There will be the profound effect of the loss of cross-subsidy and, therefore, the effect of fares and, possibly, the increased tax and rate effect. That may well be what it is. It may be that local authorities will have to press their Minister to give them more transport support grant to hold the other services in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second one will be the price that we shall have to pay in the loss of the services or the increase in the subsidiaries. The third—I believe that this has been overlooked totally in the debate up to now— will be the loss of a body of men who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
acted on the decision of Parliaments over the years as arbiters between a number of different interests in the transport industry as to what is the public interest. It will mean that an important part of the role of those men will be taken away, not only in that they will have no say about the conditions of operating express services, but also that they will no longer be in a position to weigh up seriously and realistically the effects of those services on the public interest of all the other bus services in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, I contend that there is a very high price to be paid for this and I urge the Minister, before he returns to the House on Report— I do not ask for a definitive reply now— to consider whether this definition, given the other changes that he proposes in the Bill, is really adequate for his aim or adequate in the interests of furthering public transport in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Regrettably, I had to miss the first part of the debate. May I say to the right hon.

However, I agree with him that the extension of express services will mean more services for the public and lower fares for the public, too. Of course, that is exactly what the Government intend. I challenge the dire effects that he has predicted.

My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with a great deal of the detail earlier today. I appreciate the point made by the hon.

It is a balanced argument. I make no secret of that. As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has said, we have already moved from a 25-mile to a 30-mile limit.

The further that one moves, the higher one places the limit, the more services will be taken into the traffic commissioner system at a time when we are seeking to take out as many as we can conceivably without creating a loss to the public. I believe that the Opposition and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
Government are united, at least in principle, on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness talked at some length about the practical problems that, in his view, this limit has thrown up. I can only say that organisations such as the National Bus Company and, I believe, the Confederation of Passenger Transport—let me confine my remarks to the National Bus Company—wanted a minimum distance in the express services. That is what we have sought to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) made a long speech about the rural areas. I do not complain in any way about that. Many of the policies of the Government which concern the rural areas will become clearer to him at later stages in the Bill—on clause 5 when we debate the burden of proof before traffic commissioners, and also when we debate the trial areas. The major area that the debate has centred on is the express services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all the speeches that we have heard from the Opposition, the crucial question was asked by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). He asked, "Does it improve the quality of services to the passenger?" That is what the debate is all about; that is what we have to judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a man wants to travel from Bristol to Birmingham, he may want to travel by air, rail, car or coach. This Government see no justification for seeking to restrict his choice of method of travel. If that phrase sounds familiar to hon. Members opposite, so it should, as it quotes almost word for word the Labour Government's last White Paper on transport policy. That document goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided the terms of competition are fair, if people choose to travel by coach rather than rail or air because lower fares are more important to them than speed, they should not be prevented from doing so."</p></blockquote>
That is a sentiment that I entirely support. What could be fairer than removing the present licensing restrictions that prevent bus operators from competing on equal terms with rail or air? Moreover, present restrictions allow a competitor, British Rail, to object to a bus operator's plans. That surely cannot be fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being less than fair to the argument in the White
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
Paper. The White Paper assumed that the administration of the commissioner would be maintained. He had the definition of public interest to maintain an integrated system and consult all the relevant bodies. The Bill does not provide for that. It is true that it reduces the controls. But that is not the same as the sentiment in that White Paper, which was clearly concerned about the public interest as defined in legislation that we intended to retain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not say, nor would the hon. Gentleman expect me to say, that the policy of the Labour Government was on all fours with our policy and our approach. We have heard very little from Labour Members about their philosophy and their general approach to this area. But I believe that our philosophies are very similar in one respect. The Government believe, as did the Labour Government, that provided the terms of competition in the inter-city passenger business are fair, it is up to the travelling public to make the choice. It is not for the Government or for traffic commissioners to judge what services are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we go further than the Labour Party in that direction. I genuinely believe that we have here real scope for satisfying public need. I understand the arguments about cross-subsidisation— basically that we must be fair to people going from A to B—but what about people who live in C? Hon. Members will have to weigh that argument in the balance. However, we should not presume that the present pattern of services in this country cannot be changed. Simply because it exists today is no reason why it should go on for ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central said that the essential judgment that the Committee has to make after a very long debate on the clause is whether at the end of the day there will be a better service for the public. Hon Members opposite have doubted whether new companies will come forward although, to be fair to him, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) admitted that new services were coming forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have never doubted that new companies would come forward, and we made that clear on Second Reading. Our point was that they would come
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
forward only for the profitable routes. That has been our consistent position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been suggested in respect of the express services that we are discussing. Certainly, I exempt the right hon. Gentleman, because he has made clear that he was not suggesting it. In the months before the Bill was introduced, I was attacked on the ground that new operators would not come forward and that there was no great demand for intercity services or for new coach services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that there are signs that that is exactly what is happening, the tack is being changed. I quote from a report in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> of 21 January:
	<br><blockquote><p>"New private enterprise companies plan to challenge the National Bus Company on key express coach routes when unrestricted competition returns to the business later this year for the first time in half-a-century."</p></blockquote>
Surely that is in the best interests of the public. What was the response of the National Bus Company? To do it justice, its express division controller was quoted in the same report as saying
	<br><blockquote><p>"Competition is a spur, not a threat."</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the sort of approach and feeling that we must have in the bus industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central cited the remarks of the president of the Confederation of Passenger Transport at some length concerning Sir Freddie Laker's intervention in the transatlantic air service. What did the president say should be the criterion to judge whether that intervention had been a good thing? It was to ask British Airways. With respect to him, I must say that my criterion would be to ask the passengers what they think. They can get to New York and Washington for much less money than before. Surely that is the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is missing the point. If we ask anybody, it should be those who enjoyed using the 20 domestic air routes that were closed because of competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of judgment, but at least it shows the division between the two sides of the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
on the matter. If the hon. Gentleman travels across the Atlantic and speaks to people, such as students, who are now able to benefit from the service, he will realise that Sir Freddie Laker's example should not be feared but followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that our proposal will necessarily have a dramatic effect on all inter-city coach services. However, I feel that it will provide better and cheaper services. Above all, I believe that transport policy is not just about what the operators want, but about what the travelling public want. That is our reason for inserting the clause, and I seek the Committee's support for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a fair point. I admit that I have undergone a conversion, at least to a certain extent. An honest argument has been put forward. I was in the Department of Trade with my right hon. Friend the Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) in the early days of the Labour Government and was there when Sir Freddie Laker asked for a licence, which I was then in favour of rejecting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have since used the Laker service across the Atlantic and I must admit that it was an undoubted improvement on that previously provided by other airlines. I should like to be absolutely clear about that, and I do not think that it can be denied. It has had an effect on other operators. But the point that must be taken into account is that Sir Freddie Laker is still operating under licence. He does not say that the service should be licence-free, but that the terms should be better and the criteria different. However, he welcomes the controls that a licence imposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that, he will no doubt be happy to support us in other parts of the Bill when we come to make exactly that case. We shall propose that the traffic commissioner licensing system shall continue, but it will be modified to allow the public better to be served. It is only in that respect that we shall abolish the licensing system. It is a welcome sign that we have converted the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). I look forward to further conversions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
