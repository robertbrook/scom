<p>4.35 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise to the Committee? I was in the House and have only just arrived here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 304, in page 66, line 27, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>"The obligation of the Corporation transferred by virtue of section 36 include the obligation of the Corporation set out in section 1 of the Transport Act 1968
<ol>
<li>to provide or secure or promote the provision of properly integrated services for the carriage of goods within Great Britain by road and rail;</li>
<li>to secure that in the provisions of those services, goods are carried by rail whenever such carriage is efficient and economic; and together with the British Railways Board to co-operate with regard to the matters referred to in subsection (i)."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
While you have been coming here, Mr. English, the Committee has been waiting with breathless expectation for me to move the amendment.<br><br>
It is couched in narrow terms, but contains issues of principle that could be debated very widely. Specifically contained in the amendment is the principle of freight integration. Later in the Bill we shall debate that and refer to the Freight Integration Council—or to its demise. Therefore I do not think that it would be profitable at this stage to enter into a long debate on that subject. This is the wrong time and the wrong place in the Bill to do that.<br><br>
Nevertheless, to the Opposition freight integration of road and rail is a very important principle, as is that section of the Transport Act 1968 which referred to it in the context of the National Freight Corporation. In trying to transfer that principle to the successor company, we should ensure that it should have regard to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1702</span>
road and rail integration of freight traffic.<br><br>
"Integration" is probably the most vague, often the most abused and misunderstood word in the transport vocabulary. I have been struggling to discover what an integrated transport policy is, because interpretation differs with each person to whom I speak. Since 1976, when the Department of Transport was created—with my right hon. Friend the Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers) as the Secretary of State—I have listened to practically every speech in the House about an integrated transport system. I do not know how I have survived all those speeches, but I have done so and shall tell the Committee my tale.<br><br>
The best approach to freight integration is the interpretation in the amendment. There is a functional definition of the principle of integration.<br><br>
Integration is associated with the function of various modes of transport; with what they do at present and have done in the past. I should like to refer the Committee to paragraph 8 (3) (ii) of schedule 6 as proposed in our amendment, which refers to an obligation:
<br><blockquote><p>"to secure that in the provisions of those services, goods are carried by rail whenever such carriage is efficient and economic".</p></blockquote>
Those words "efficient and economic" are important.<br><br>
Lest it be thought that the Opposition are trying to saddle the successor company with a social obligation that has no economic meaning, nor one in terms of cost and efficiency and the proper commercial running of the business, I should like to stress the words in the amendment—"efficient and economic".<br><br>
The Opposition set great store by integration for its own sake. That is, in social terms, we wish to get a lot of heavy traffic off the roads and onto the railways. We do not want to do that if at the end of the day the policy is so grossly uneconomic that it means impairing the efficiency of the whole transport network. That is not what we seek.<br><br>
In its narrow terms the amendment proposes to put an obligation on the successor company to consider rail freight as an important part of an integrated service that could be provided. We are completely confident that the use of rail for freight can be economic and efficient. Close examination of the amendment shows that it stresses commercial and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0925">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1703</span>
economic matters. The Opposition appreciate that if the new successor company is saddled with a social obligation difficult problems will arise. Such obligations must be funded by Government.<br><br>
There is a strong line of argument that although a private company based on commercial principles should take social costs into account that is something which properly lies within the perspective of central Government, and not the narrow confines of a commercial company that is operating for profit. As my right hon. and hon. Friends will emphasise in the course of the debate on the amendment, it has been couched deliberately to emphasise the phrase "efficient and economic".<br><br>
In our debate on amendment No. 303 the Parliamentary Secretary said that he found the prose rather turgid and pedestrian. Nevertheless, I commend the wording of this amendment, which is succinct, clear and states simply and exactly what we wish it to do.<br><br>
It should be noted that we do not seek to create any administrative superstructure for the transfer of freight from road to rail in the context of the new company. I am certain that the amendment will be resisted by the Government on the ground that when the successor company comes into being it will be necessary to give the new board the power and flexibility to make its own commercial decisions.<br><br>
I can anticipate the Government's arguing that a successor company cannot be tied down in respect of what it regards as a commercial decision between road or rail, or integrated services. I do not doubt that the Government will say, "We shall have a new board for the successor company which will take decisions that are commercially profitable and viable. If those include an integrated service, that will be adopted as part of the company's commercial policy."<br><br>
I have some doubts about that line of argument. At present, it is too readily assumed by many transport operators that railway transport is uneconomic when they have not undertaken a full investigation of what railways can offer in carrying freight.<br><br>
I commend the amendment to the Committee. We place a high priority on this principle.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1704</span>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the general points about integration which we shall reach with one of the later clauses in any case. It seems that those who are not in favour of integration are clearly in favour of disintegration as part of their general overall attitude towards industry in this country. Disintegration seems to be the major objective of Government policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is irresponsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is quite irresponsible for the Government to pursue a policy of the disintegration of industry, a policy that is proceeding merrily as a result of the deliberations of the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph).<br><br>
Rather than refer to the generalities of the question of integration to which we shall come later, I wish to refer to a specific group of problems that it is envisaged will arise both for British Rail and the NFC should our very sensible amendment not be accepted. In particular, problems are likely to arise for British Rail in continuing to handle the collection and delivery of what it refers to as "smalls" traffic. In other words, that is not wagon-load traffic. The collection of wagon-load traffic in containers is handled by Freightliners which is now a subsidiary of British Rail.<br><br>
In terms of revenue earned, the British Rail contract represents about 25 per cent, of National Carriers' business and produced a profit of £2 million for National Carriers last year. Receipts from British Rail parcels traffic last year totalled £119 million, and of this £42.5 million, which is 35 per cent., came from collected and delivered traffic. British Rail's expenditure on parcels traffic last year, which was £118 million, included £25 million paid to National Carriers in respect of cartage charges. Total British Rail receipts for freight and parcels in 1978 were £493.9 million.<br><br>
To put British Rail's parcels business in perspective, about 69 per cent. of the total market of 1,700 million packages a year is handled by own-account operators, NFC's share is 5 per cent. and the proportion taken by British Rail is only 3 per cent. The railways board is pessimistic about retaining this share, a view not shared by the unions involved that tend to be less
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0926">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1705</span>
pessimistic about the prospects of the transport industry in general. However, in addition to the contract for the parcels service British Rail is also reliant on National Carriers for the cartage of most of what it calls its "less than wagon-load" freight. The volume of collected and delivered traffic on British Rail is about 2 million tonnes annually which is less than 2 per cent. of the total freight activity of the board which amounted to 171 million tonnes in 1978. The existing contractual arrangements between National Carriers and British Rail operate within a framework of a code of practice agreed between the board and National Carriers. The arrangements provide for British Rail to advise National Carriers on an annual basis of its total vehicle requirement. Actual requirements at area level are negotiated locally on a four-monthly basis, and the contract price for this can be adjusted at the start of a new contract to meet special circumstances, such as, for example, an increase in the price of oil.<br><br>
These arrangements can continue after the repeal of sections I to 5 of the 1968 Act. However, if British Rail is to maintain a national collection and delivery service, and presumably that is the Government's intention, it is essential that it is provided with the facilities for the necessary cartage at the end of journeys. It is feasible that British Rail could find contractors from the private sector to do that, but it is unlikely that any private hauliers can offer a service similar to that supplied to British Rail by National Carriers. On the other hand, there may be a temptation on the part of British Rail to put parts of this contract out to separate tender in specific towns and areas. At this point it must be recognised that there are certain areas of the country where National Carriers' operations are too thin on the ground for the work to be put to it even at present. That particularly applies in isolated areas of Scotland and Wales.<br><br>
Given the cut-throat nature of the business it is almost certain that in these circumstances National Carriers will be undercut by some operators in particular areas anxious to get a foothold in a business with an annual turnover exceeding £25 million. Any proposal of this nature by British Rail would certainly be vigorously opposed by the NUR and the other unions involved, first, because that must result in a loss of jobs of the union mem-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1706</span>
bers of National Carriers, and second, because part of the commercial advantage gained by any private haulier will be built on the foundation of inferior conditions of service for staff.<br><br>
In other words, there is a general undercutting in standards of pay and terms and conditions of operators in competition with National Carriers. In this respect trade union pressure has ensured that the basic rates of pay in the hire and reward sector of the road haulage industry are almost common throughout the country, but in terms of pensions and sickness and accident benefits, the NFC's conditions are far better than anything prevailing in the private sector.<br><br>
Therefore, in a sense the only way in which British Rail can fund someone to undercut National Carriers for this service is by engaging an operator who is doling out to his staff worse terms and conditions.<br><br>
Another reason for resisting a piecemeal approach to the British Rail contract is that this places in jeopardy the national parcels service operated by the railways. If the railways allocate part of the existing contract to private hauliers, National Carriers is likely to up the price on that part of the contract that remains with it. That would be a natural response and would obviously mean that no financial advantage would be gained by British Rail, although it has on occasions indulged in activities that led it to that.<br><br>
In these circumstances the board may feel obliged to extend its involvement with private hauliers into more and more areas until National Carriers is squeezed out. The consequence would be the loss of hundreds of jobs of National Carriers' staff who are predominantly members of the NUR. The railway collection and delivery service—this is important for those using the railways for "less than wagon-load" loads—will vary significantly in standard from one part of the country to another. At present it may generally be described as being postalised and of a fairly universal nature. It is not likely to remain so in future. People who have been accustomed to having what I have described as a postalised service will not get it in future and they will not be very happy about that.<br><br>
The general national level of service presently provided by the—[Hon. Members: "Who is the author?".]—I am asked "Who is the author?". Normally I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0927">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1707</span>
speak happily from notes that I have scribbled but in this case I have been reading from an excellent brief prepared by the research officers of the NUR. I am as happy to do this as the Minister will be to read from the notes prepared for him by his advisers. The basic point which I have been trying to get on record in detail are the present ramifications of the agreement between BR and the NFC—and National Carriers in particular. There is a great deal of inter-relationship between National Carriers and British Rail. This inter-relationship is beneficial to British Rail, to National Carriers and to the people who work for them and, above all, to those who depend on the services that those two organisations offer and provide.<br><br>
I believe that if the amendment is rejected there will eventually be a general breakdown of the national arrangements which prevail at present between National Carriers and British Rail. That breakdown will be considerably to the disadvantage of the people who presently make use of that service. Once again, I put what can only be described as an argument which ought to appeal to those who posed to the electorate at the last election as Conservatives: the system is working fairly well at the moment but for doctrinaire reasons based on a doctrine which has no relationship whatever with Conservatism, they propose to do away with the relationship which has already been established. As with other aspects of schedule 6, those included within it and those which we have sought to have included today, we intend that there should be a sensible carry-over of workable arrangements which have proved their worth over the years in the NFC.<br><br>
If the Minister, at the end of his period of office, were proved as worthy as the arrangements we have been commending, and if the people in his Department who have been advising him could be shown to be of as much value to the country as the people who work in the National Freight Corporation and British Rail, the country would be much better off than it is now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) on one point. He described the concept of integration in transport policy as vague. He said that he had spent a considerable time trying to work out what an integrated transport policy was. Indeed, it is fair to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1708</span>
say that the Secretary of State under whom he served in the previous Labour Government also spent a considerable time doing the same. He concluded that anything which had been set down previously as being understood by the Labour Party as an integrated transport policy was not on.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) said that those who question and oppose the prospect of an integrated transport policy are in favour of disintegration. That is the most absurd over-generalisation. If an integrated transport policy means anything, it has to do perhaps with transferring the carriage of freight from road to rail; that is normally considered part of the process. Yet it was during the Labour Government's last period of office that the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the late Anthony Crosland, said in his orange paper on transport policy of the prospect of a large amount of longdistance freight traffic going from road to rail,
<br><blockquote><p>"Alas, it is a pipe dream."</p></blockquote>
I think that the orange paper overstates the objections. I think that British Rail have an opportunity for gaining freight, and I should like to see that opportunity exploited.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
I think, however, that what we have to be sure of is how exactly that is achieved. In my view the way to do it is certainly not by seeking to write in legislation generalisations about the need for an integrated transport policy or, indeed, the need for a massive shift from road to rail. What is needed is a solid base of policy decisions. The policy decision that is required here is for the Government to decide what are the fair track costs of road and rail and then for there to be fair competition between the freight carriers as to whether they go by road or by rail.<br><br>
In setting up the National Freight Corporation the then Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, intended that it should play a central role in the implementation of her policy of integration. In the event, however—and this is the point that both hon. Gentlemen missed—this was not brought about by successive Governments, including the previous Labour Government. There is no serious doubt or question about that. The corporation has been given an increasingly commercial remit, not just by this Govern-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0928">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1709</span>
ment but by the previous Government, too. It has concentrated upon the development of its road haulage and related activities with relatively little emphasis on the broad objectives of integration, as laid down in the 1968 Act.<br><br>
I want to make this point—it is a point that I am more entitled to make than perhaps Labour Members—that when in the Transport Act 1978 the Labour Government decided that Freightliners should go back into the control of British Rail, that was not a step forward towards integration. The whole concept of Freightliners previously under the 1968 Act was exactly the concept of integration and joint ownership between NFC and British Rail.<br><br>
Basically, the relevance of the integration concept as laid down in 1968 is today out of date. I do not believe that it has today anything like the force that it perhaps had in 1968. It would be unacceptable in principle because the Government's clear and firm intention is that the successor company's powers and obligations should be confined to those conferred by the Companies Act. Any special requirement, such as those proposed, would make the private investor suspect an obligation of this kind.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South raised the question of National Carriers and its relationships. Where the National Freight Corporation and British Rail work together, as they do in the case of National Carriers and the parcels delivery service, it is for reasons of mutual commercial advantage rather than because of any statutory requirement. That continues to be the case. If it is to the mutual advantage of British Rail and the National Freight Corporation to come together for an arrangement of that kind, clearly that is an arrangement that will continue. But that is something that we have to leave to the industry and to British Rail to work out for themselves.<br><br>
My view is basically that where NFC and British Rail co-operate, it is for reasons of mutual commercial benefit, and not because of statutory obligations. The application of the amendment to the successor company would be an empty gesture, but, in any event, it is incompatible with the fundamental principle of the Bill, which is to avoid placing any unusual obligations on the successor company. The new company will be free to co-operate with British Rail, and I certainly hope that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1710</span>
it will do so, as the NFC now does. But it will be on the basis that it is in the commercial interests of each party.<br><br>
The last 12 years have shown that what was written in 1968 has not been proved. Hon. Gentlemen may criticise that. I say only that if they do, it has not happened under either Government. The concept is outdated in the way that it is expressed, and unnecessary in the form of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will leave most of the integration argument until we discuss the clauses which actually delete such items as, for example, quantity licensing and the Freight Integration Council, which are the essence of the integration argument.<br><br>
On the Minister's point about the transfer of Freightliners to British Rail, I sat on the Select Committee and voted against Freightliners remaining part of the NFC. That is certainly not in line with what my colleagues wanted but I believed then, and still believe, in the integration of freight. The point I make here is that, prior to the removal of Freightliners to British Rail, much of the work of handling freight and container boxes went to Freightliners because NFC was disposed to try to put as much traffic as possible onto Freightliners. That was the whole purpose of freight integration. There had to be an interest, and indeed an obligation, to help the NFC develop.<br><br>
When we come to debate freight integration, we must bear in mind the thinking behind the quantity licensing principle, because that was felt to be giving further impetus to the development of freight integration. But the Minister was correct. No Government implemented it and no chairman seemed to want to fight for the relevant clause. But will the Minister accept that the NFC has, up to now, had a vested interest, and, indeed, a statutory obligation, to put many of the containers onto British Rail. Under the new, private company that may not necessarily be the obligation, and it may be disposed to putting more onto road than rail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. The argument then advanced was that those people who believed in an integrated transport system would actually have preferred the status quo as regards Freightliners, because it was a jointly-owned company of British Rail and a

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1711</span>
road-based company, the National Freight Corporation. Freightliners was—I use this dreadful word—an intermodal company located between the two. It appeared to move much better into the theory of an integrated transport policy.<br><br>
That was not the decision reached by the previous Government, nor, indeed, was it backed by the rail unions. They said, "We know all about this theory of integration, but we believe that British Rail should go out and market Freightliners and do so in</span></p>

<p>a much more positive way". So, in effect, they were saying "Never mind about the generalisations about integration.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schedule deals largely with the liabilities and obligations of the National Freight Corporation being transferred to the successor company. It is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1713</span>
a part of the Bill that has not been greatly publicised. In fact, far more publicity has attached to the proposals in the Bill that would relieve the successor company of obligations and liabilities which now attach to the NFC. For example, there is the removal from the successor company of the requirement to pay fixed interest on capital debts and loans.<br><br>
We understand why there has been so little publicity for these important provisions in the schedule. The Government think that it would be much easier to sell these public assets at a good price if people were far more seized of the relief from obligations and liabilities which attach to the running of the successor company than of the obligations and liabilities that it will undertake. In discussing the schedule stand part, we are obliged to look carefully at these.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister, first, about the responsibility of the successor company as regards members of the board. Can he say whether this schedule will, as it appears, create a liability to compensate any board members for loss of office as a result of reorganisation or transfer of this public asset to the private sector? If it does, will the Minister state whether this is a direct charge upon the successor company under the provisions of the schedule? I ask that question being conscious, of course, that the schedule makes it clear that no member of the board can be bound to provide, by any contract now existing, services to the successor company which he has to provide to the NFC. So a judgment appears to have been made by the Minister when he issued his instructions to those who drafted the Bill. First, he wanted to protect the directors—which is understandable and I made no adverse criticism of that—against any loss that would accrue to them from a loss of contractual rights for services which they provide as directors to NFC. Second, he did not want to bind them, in return for that protection, to give those services to the successor company. What is the thinking behind that?<br><br>
Is it merely a question of protecting the freedom of the director? Does the Minister take the view that the director has entered into a contractual relationship with the NFC to provide services and cannot, therefore, reasonably be bound to continue those same services when the NFC ceases to exist as such and becomes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1714</span>
the successor company? Does he believe that the successor company, or the taxpayer, depending on how the Minister answers the first question, should be obliged to compensate the member of the board in those circumstances?<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
My view of this is that if the public are to be liable for that compensation, in that the successor company is operating through a period when it is wholly publicly owned, it is harder to justify the compensation than it would be once part or all of the public assets are sold into private ownership. On the other hand, I can see that the Minister must make a judgment on whether it is a reasonable liability to place on the company, given that he wants to keep down the liabilities so that he can sell off the assets as quickly as possible.<br><br>
This question has become more pertinent as a result of the statement made when we debated clause 36—namely, that one of the options open to the Minister is to have a considerable period between the nominated day and the actual flotation of the shares. In that period, when we are still dealing with an operation like the NFC—fully publicly owned, operating with a greater freedom than ever before, lifted of the obligation to pay fixed-rate interest on capital debt and loans—there is obviously some advantage to the public in having the expertise and considerable experience of good executive directors now under contracts of service to the NFC. I want to know, first, the intentions of the drafters of the Bill and, second, the reasoning behind them.<br><br>
I turn to the point raised in paragraph 4 of the schedule, which appears to me to include among the liabilities or obligations to transfer to the successor company those set out in section 135 of the Transport Act 1968. That states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall by regulations require the payment by such person as may be determined … under the regulations … of compensation"</p></blockquote>
in certain circumstances. Among the circumstances given in the section is:
<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the manner in which the carrying on of the activities of … the Freight Corporation is organised".</p></blockquote>
I contend that we certainly now have in the Bill a change in the manner in which the NFC is organised.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0931">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1715</span>
The persons referred to in section 135 are those who suffer
<br><blockquote><p>"loss or diminution of emoluments or pensions rights".</p></blockquote>
I can find no provision in the Bill to repeal that section, but I can find a specific provision in schedule 6 for that section to continue. Therefore, the question arises as to how this can be reconciled with the very deliberate limitation of pension rights and obligations which could flow to the successor company on its transfer from the present NFC. It is clear that the Minister does not have the power or even, I suggest, an obligation to make this provision for safeguarding and compensating people against the loss of pension rights and emoluments. The serious issue therefore arises of how that is to be reconciled. Is the Minister to contend that that provision in schedule 6 is to some extent circumscribed or over-ridden by subsequent provisions in the Bill? It is important that we know that now, before we go on to a discussion of pension rights. Why is an obligation under section 135 carried on in the Bill without defining specifically the circumstances of the operation and leaving that broad, and possibly valuable, description for the number of people whose pensions may be affected in that section of the 1968 Act?<br><br>
You have indicated, Mr. English, that it would be appropriate to discuss new clause 23. This relates to the power of the Minister to dissolve certain subsidiaries of the NFC. The reason for tabling the new clause is to explore ways in which we might bring about an amendment to the Bill which would take away that power and to seek to recruit the support of the Minister for such a limitation of his powers.<br><br>
I do so with some optimism and hope of success, because the Minister has declared that it is no part of his intention to break up the NFC in any way in advance of the operation of the successor company. I hope that the Minister will agree that there could be considerable advantages to the public interest if the successor company broadly continued the operation now carried on by the NFC, and developed it. However, I only need to secure the Minister's support for the proposition that while the company is in his hands, up to the nominated day, he will not break up the NFC or dissolve any of its subsidiaries.<br><br>
The power which the Minister now has is to be found in sections 7 and 8 of the 1968 Act. Section 8 states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1716</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may by order … make any such provision with respect to … any wholly-owned subsidiary".</p></blockquote>
of the NFC which is mentioned
<br><blockquote><p>"In paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) of subsection (1) … of section 7.".</p></blockquote>
Section 7 refers to schemes for the
<br><blockquote><p>"dissolution of any of the wholly-owned subsidiaries.".</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"for the transfer of any specified property … or of all property.".</p></blockquote>
owned by the undertakings—the undertakings including the NFC.<br><br>
There is, therefore, no doubt that the Minister has this important power over the operation of the NFC.<br><br>
We are anxious to ensure that he does not use it to dissolve any of the subsidiaries. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us a clear undertaking that he accepts, in principle, that there should not be a continued power. Perhaps the Bill could be amended at a later stage to achieve that limitation. That is totally consistent with the aim of keeping the NFC in existence in its present form, or at least not destroying it to the extent of dissolving any of the subsidiaries or transferring its property rights in advance of the nominated day.<br><br>
Is it the intention, as regards the repeal provisions, that that situation will cease to exist on the nominated day in any case? The Minister will appreciate that there is a difference between the repeal provisions which take effect on the nominated day and those which take effect on the Bill's becoming an Act. Are those which take effect on the nominated day such that that power will cease to exist in any case? It will be helpful if we can clear up those points, particularly those relating to pension rights and powers to dissolve subsidiaries, before we turn to other aspects of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter of industrial relations has been raised in the debate. Can the Minister give an indication at this stage as to his thinking about the appointment of the board? I ask that specific question because the Minister has been pressed by interests outside the House, particularly the TUC, on the subject. The minutes of those discussions show that he undertook to give an indication on Second Reading of the likely composition of the board. Will trade unionists be considered for appointments to the new board which may be in the process of being set up?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1717</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 6 deals with a number of detailed but clearly important issues arising from the transfer of the NFC to the successor company under clause 36. Much of the schedule is concerned with legal details, and it is perhaps not necessary for me to go over those.<br><br>
I shall concentrate on two provisions before turning to the right hon. Gentleman's specific questions. They are concerned with the position of employees, which has undoubtedly prompted the concern of the Opposition. Paragraph 4 deals with the whole question of employee compensation. It specifically transfers from the NFC to the company the compensating functions under existing employee compensation schemes. The company will have exactly the same responsibilities as the NFC. Protection of employees under those schemes remains unchanged.<br><br>
The Bill makes no provision for any new compensation scheme to cover the Government's proposals for the NFC. We take the view that it is unnecessary to afford any special protection beyond that which is available to all employees under the Employment Protection Act. We also take the view that employees have no reason to see the transfer of the NFC to the private sector as incompatible with their interests. In our view, transfer will give far greater opportunities for commercial success than are now available to the NFC within the public sector. That commercial success, rather than any complicated compensation system, will bring the real benefits and protection to the staff. In other words, Government policy will provide new opportunities for the existing staff of NFC, and that is a much greater guarantee for the future than could be provided by new legislation.<br><br>
The Bill will not interfere with travel concessions enjoyed by ex-British Rail staff transferred to the National Freight Corporation or by their widows and dependants. Paragraph 7(2) gives power to the Minister to reimburse the company for payments made to British Rail and to the London Transport Executive in respect of travel concessions in just the same way as he now does for the National Freight Corporation. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has already made that clear, but I repeat it because I recognise the concern of the Opposition, not least the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1718</span>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
I gladly give the undertaking that the right hon. Gentleman seeks a new clause 23. There is no intention to break up the National Freight Corporation. The effect of the new clause would be to prohibit the Minister from using the existing powers under sections 7 and 8 of the Transport Act 1968 to make an order providing for the reorganisation, amalgamation or dissolution of any wholly owned National Freight Corporation subsidiary. That would preclude the Government from taking any action to change the existing structure or organisation of the NFC prior to its reconstitution as a Companies Act company.<br><br>
The power in section 8 of the 1968 Act enabling the Minister to make an order for reorganisation has not been used since the establishment of the NFC. There is absolutely no reason to believe that it will be used during the remaining period before the appointed day, at which time the power will lapse with the NFC's change of status to that of a Companies Act company. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that the Government have no intention of forcing any structural change upon the National Freight Corporation. I believe that formal prohibition of its use is therefore unnecessary. Under paragraph 3(3) there is no obligation to compensate board members. It is entirely permissive and would depend upon the position at the time.<br><br>
The pension rights of employees and ex-employees are not affected. They are included in the contracts of employment transferred under clause 36. Existing board members' pensions are transferred under paragraph 5 of the schedule. That is necessary because those pensions are governed by a legal determination made by the Minister under the Transport Act.<br><br>
My main point is the one that I made at the beginning. The Government's proposals will have benefits not only in terms of general policy, but for the employees of the National Freight Corporation. The National Freight Corporation will now be able to take advantage of opportunities with the prospect of becoming an even more successful company. I believe that that is the kind of guarantee that is of most importance to the staff of the National Freight Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whilst the obligation to pay
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0933">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1719</span>
compensation to a board member is at the discretion of the Minister under paragraph 3(3) of the schedule, it is certainly not at the discretion of the successor company. Paragraph 3(3) provides that the Minister may—
<br><blockquote><p>"require the successor company to pay … such sum as the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service, may determine."</p></blockquote>
There may be freedom for the Minister there, but there is no freedom for the successor company. If the Minister is now saying that members of the board who lose office will be at his mercy in this respect and will have to rely upon him to use his discretion in that way, at least that makes the position clear. It also removes an uncertainty in one sense. However, it cannot remove the uncertainty whether the successor company will have to pay. Presumably, unless the Minister makes his determination in advance, when deciding whether or not to take shares in the successor company people will simply have to accept that they may or may not be landed with that liability. At least, I suppose that is finite in terms of the number of people involved, because it affects only the board members.<br><br>
I was very surprised at the Minister's answer in respect of paragraph 4. He now appears to be saying that section 135(1)(<i>b</i>) of the 1968 Act appears to continue rights to compensation only in respect of previous changes and has no bearing on the present change. But the wording of the section is open to far wider interpretation than that which the Minister put on it. The section refers to—
<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the manner in which the carrying on of the activities of the … Freight Corporation is organised made in pursuance of … section 6 (1) or 45(5) of this Act".</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that those qualifications rule out recourse to that power for anybody who subsequently says that he has been the loser as a result of this reorganisation? Presumably he could claim against the successor company that he should have been safeguarded against the effects of any previous reorganisation. If so, it must stand in relation to other changes made in pension liabilities. It is important to get that matter clear.<br><br>
Having heard what the Minister said and read the section again, it may be that the intention of the reference to section 135 of the 1968 Act is only a matter of keeping
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1720</span>
in existence rights and compensations already determined by its provisions. I assume he is saying that, in respect of the changes which will come about from this legislation, the statutory safeguard is to be found not in the Bill but in the Employment Protection Act. In that case, we shall have to go carefully over those provisions to see whether, in respective of successor companies, they are holding as good as those of us with responsibility for them intended. Not all the measures in that Act have worked out as well as we had hoped.<br><br>
However, if the Minister has given us the official answer, that is where we shall have to direct the attention of many people who are concerned about what might happen to certain important rights that they established under previous legislation and in negotiation over subsequent changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it will help the right hon. Gentleman, I shall certainly re-examine section 135 and write to him with definitive guidance about it.<br><br>
On the first point that the right hon. Gentleman made concerning compensation for members of the board, his understanding of the position is correct, always remembering, of course, that any decision must be taken within three months from the appointed day.<br><br>
I apologise for a discourtesy in that I did not reply to the point put to me by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) concerning appointments to the board. Clearly, that is a matter that we shall have to consider. Options are open at present. Certainly, there will be no rule against a trade unionist being a board member—nor should there be. However, neither is there any other requirement. The Government have an entirely open mind at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister on the repeal of the power that he will have to make an order dissolving a subsidiary? He has confirmed that the power will be repealed from the nominated day, not from when the Bill is passed. What possible reason can there be for not repealing that power on the passing of the Bill, given the Minister's declared intention not to dissolve any subsidiaries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The power has lain unused in respect of the corporation for over 10 years. It seems sensible for it to lapse

formally on the appointed day, together with the other powers in the 1968 Act that relate to the NFC's status as a statutory corporation. It is simply a matter of convenience. But with the undertaking that I have given, I should have thought that the Committee would be content to allow the matter to remain as it is.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before speaking to the amendment, may I ask you, Mr. English, for a little guidance? During our brief break today, I read both the Amendment Paper and the document listing the Chairman's selection of amendments. I found amendment No. 289 in the selection list for the morning sitting and duly noted that it had been printed in the Amendment Paper. However, on arriving for our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1722</span>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a misprint on the afternoon selection list. Although it says Amendment No. 298, I read out amendment No. 289.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English. Far be it from me to mislead the Committee by moving a non-existent amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope that the hon. Gentleman has moved, not that amendment, but amendment No. 286.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought it important to establish the correct procedure, Mr. English.<br><br>
It seems logical to me for the Government to expect the Opposition to table this amendment. I shall speak first to amendment No. 286, although I seek to make the point, Mr. English, that I should have wished to move all the amendments—that is, amendments Nos. 286, 289, 306, and 302. I hope that, depending on what the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary says, we shall divide on the matter, because I believe that the amendments encapsulate the basic political difference between the two sides of the Committee.<br><br>
I shall be brief. Amendment No. 286(1A) enshrines the concept that it is necessary for the House of Commons to retain some control. It is all very well for Ministers to have regulations to deal with matters outside the House, but on this issue we believe that the Minister or his nominees should not offer for sale any securities except by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. That is the nub of the matter.<br><br>
As the Bill stands, it would be in order for the Minister to appoint a nominee whom we do not know—or whom he, of course, may not even use. However, given that fact, we may find that a Minister in his wisdom—or otherwise—nominates someone to receive the securities and, having done that, he will also delegate the power to dispose of them. That is not logical and should not be allowed. It should be a decision of the House of Commons as to whether the successor company or the nominee disposes of the securities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0935">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1723</span>
I turn now to proposed subsection (IB) in amendment No. 286 which deals with a subject that has been raised in the Committee time and again. I do not believe that any of my right hon. or hon. Friends on this side of the Committee has received a definite answer on whether the NFC will be disposed of in its entirety or in parts. Given that fact I. believe the proposed subsection (IB) is very relevant. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The securities which the Minister or his nominees determine should be offered for sale shall be in respect of the whole of the successor company and not of a subsidiary of the successor company".</p></blockquote>
If the amendment is carried we shall at last, after many hours of probing, get the answer that the Government are reluctant to give.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
Is it the Government's intention that the NFC will be disposed of as a whole, or is it the case, as we suspect, that the private sector is after the lucrative subsidiaries of the NFC? If that is the case, the Committee should be told. If it is not, the Government should accept the amendment because it clearly lays down in subsection (1B) that it shall not be possible to divide the NFC and that it will be retained in its entirety.<br><br>
I turn to the proposed subsection (1C) of amendment No. 286. Time and again we have heard about asset strippers who, apparently, are non-existent. Unlike the Government, we live in the real world, and in the real world there are asset strippers about. When the Parliamentary Secretary came into the Committee room tonight and took off his coat L said, "Here comes an asset stripper." Unfortunately, he was taking off only his coat, so I completely withdraw that remark as he was obviously making himself comfortable for a period in the Committee.<br><br>
If the Parliamentary Secretary is wrong and asset strippers exist—and we on this side of the Committee know that asset strippers exist, that they have stripped assets from companies and that matters will be no different with the NFC—it seems that the amendment will meet both sides of the case, because the proposed subsection (1C) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister or his nominees shall not offer for sale at one time more than ten per cent, of the securities issued to him or his nominees by the successor company".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1724</span>
If one looks at the proposed subsections (1A) and (1C) one will see what we are driving at, because in proposed subsection (1A) we say that an affirmative order of the House will be needed before the securities can be disposed of and in proposed subsection (1C) that such disposal shall be no more than 10 per cent. Therefore, we shall have a rolling programme for watching how these shares are disposed of and to whom.<br><br>
Whether the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister accept the fact, it seems reasonable to those who live in the real world that there will be people—perhaps only a small percentage but that will be large enough—who will seek to obtain shares in the NFC for various reasons. One of the reasons could be—I put it no higher than that—to safeguard their own business by destroying the competition.<br><br>
For instance, if I were running a road transport business or were part of a combine running such a business it would seem reasonable to acquire some of the shares in the NFC on that same side of the business to safeguard my own interests, because, in effect, I shall be putting my main competitor out of competition.<br><br>
The amendment would prevent that, because if the shares could be disposed of at only 10 per cent. a time we should be able to monitor the proceedings and it is very important that we retain the responsibility to monitor who is buying the shares. I believe that the proposed subsection (1C) covers that point.<br><br>
I do not wish to delay the Committee, so I now turn to the controversial amendment No. 289. The amendment is very important because it deals with the point that one would suppose that the Minister would always try to obtain the best price when disposing of the securities of the successor company. We disagree that the Minister should be able to dispose of any of the securities because they belong to the taxpayer. However, being realists and seeing that the Bill will, unfortunately, go on to the statute book, we must try to safeguard the position as far as we can.<br><br>
To put matters bluntly, we have a very great vested interest. When one looks beyond the Bill, part of the payment that will come from the sale of the shares will be channelled into pensions. Therefore, it is vital that, on behalf of the people who are members of the pension scheme, the best price is obtained from the sale of the shares—given that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0936">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1725</span>
completely disagree with their sale. I can see no directive in the Bill for anyone to obtain that best price. That may not be a decision for the present Minister as he may by that time hold another job. A future Minister might have intentions different from what the present Minister intended. Therefore, it is important to write into the Bill that the best price for the shares shall be obtained. It may well be that the Minister will be elevated elsewhere and the Parliamentary Secretary moved into his position. In that case there may not be a problem, but, again, it may be that the Parliamentary Secretary will also occupy a completely different post and we shall be faced with two new Ministers who may put a completely different interpretation on this part of the Bill from what is presently intended.<br><br>
I am dealing with matters as rapidly as I can. I turn to amendment No. 306 which, again, is very important. Provision is made in the Bill to deal with the successor company. What will be the position when the successor company takes over and decides to sell some of the assets to another company? That is part of the Government's policy. Amendment No. 306 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"Securities of the successor company held by the Minister or by nominees."</p></blockquote>
Again we come to the word "nominees". Perhaps when the Minister replies he will inform the Committee whether he intends to have a nominee or nominees, or whether he will retain control. That is vitally important to the Bill and we should be aware of this when we are discussing each stage of the Bill. The amendment continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be disposed of in such a way as to sell any part of the property or rights of the successor company to another company or person."</p></blockquote>
Having set up the successor company surely it is not right that it should then dispose of the assets to whomsoever it chooses. I live in the real world. I do not suggest motives, but people in the successor company could easily be from other companies, and they may well dispose of the assets to their own companies. Amendment No. 306 takes account of that possibility.<br><br>
We do not aim the amendment at the 98 per cent, of genuine people, but whether or not we in the Committee like it, there are people who are not genuine and who would seek to make a killing here. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1726</span>
our opinion amendment No. 306 would cope with that.<br><br>
Finally, amendment No. 302 relates to the nub of the problem. It lays on the Minister the obligation to retain 51 per cent. of the shares. When discussing the amendment it is important to pay heed to what the Minister said when he met the TUC transport industries committee on 19 November. This is the only guide that we have. I have here a report of what was said. I do not know whether the Minister will agree with it, but if he does not he has the chance to put that on the record.<br><br>
According to the document,
<br><blockquote><p>"He said that the Government could"—</p></blockquote>
note the word "could"—
<br><blockquote><p>"retain control of the Corporation even with less than 51 per cent of the shares, but in any case the Government did not want control."</p></blockquote>
I should like the Minister to explain how one can control a company with less than 51 per cent. of the shares. It would be most interesting to know that, and I hope that the Minister will take time to explain it. However, in the same breath he says that the Government do not wish to control the company. That is illogical. He cannot say that the Government will control the company with less than 51 per cent. of the shares and then in the same breath, without a pause, say that they do not wish to control it.<br><br>
The Opposition believe that it is necessary for the Government to maintain control. If they do not, many of the things that they have said in the Committee mean nothing. The Government will be incapable of substantiating what they have said. Many times they have given assurances that can be reliable only if they are in control.<br><br>
Finally, I should like the Minister to explain how he is to retain control of the company with less than 51 per cent. of the shares, as he said to the TUC he would. If he does not intend to do that how can he honour many of the things that he has said in this Committee? The power to honour his words will be out of his jurisdiction. The successor company will be an independent body, no longer controlled by the Government. It will dictate decisions independently of what the Government meant, whether or not the Government like it. It will be an independent company completely outside Government control. In that case nothing that has been said has any credibility.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1727</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly in support of all the amendments in this most important group. They all touch on important points and are linked together in terms of principle.<br><br>
I should like to endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle, Central (Mr. Cowans) about amendment No. 286. He spent some time on that amendment. I do not wish to spend much time on it, as I wish to direct most of my remarks to amendment No. 302, which would impose an obligation to retain 51 per cent. of the shares at all times.<br><br>
6 p.m.<br><br>
I should like to say just one or two minutes' worth about amendment No. 286. I shall take it in parts, and deal first with subsection (1A). I do not, as a rule, like to force affirmative resolutions on Governments. It is the oldest trick in the book. It is always open to anyone to argue that any subject whatsoever is sufficiently important in social and economic terms to be discussed in the form of an affirmative resolution. There are some things that are simply not worth an affirmative resolution. But I believe that this is. It contains a most important point of principle and important matters relating to public finance, and to the guarding of the public purse and the taxpayers' money. Therefore it should be incumbent on the Government to argue their case both in the House of Commons and in another place. I think—at least I hope—that the Minister will listen to arguments for affirmative resolution in this case because it is of sufficient public importance.<br><br>
Section (1B) is more important. I am sorry to say that we have not had a straight answer from the Government on the subject it covers. Is it the Government's policy to try to keep the successor company intact? That is the $64,000 question. The Government will give us no assurance. They seem in one sense to be arguing that they will keep the company together in order to have the advantages of a large company with 10 per cent. of the market. But at other times we can get no answer. The Government's drift of the argument then seems to be that the new company has the commercial freedom to split up or to stay together. Either of those propositions will hold good but not both at the same time. Will the Minister give us a straight answer? Do the Govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1728</span>
ment intend to try to keep the company intact?<br><br>
Subsection (1 B) of the amendment seeks to keep the company together. It is no secret that the Opposition have a high regard for the NFC and its activities. A direct corollary of that is that we have a high regard for the present structure and for the whole framework of the operation as it now stands. We should like to see that retained. But clearly if the successor board is to have freedom of operation it is doubtful whether that will happen. All that I want is a statement from the Government whether they will or will not try to keep the company together. We shall listen carefully for that answer, and I hope that we shall not listen in vain.<br><br>
The proposed sub section (1 C) provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister or his nominees shall not offer for sale at one time more than ten per cent. of the securities issued to him or his nominees by the successor company."</p></blockquote>
I quite see the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central about the matter. It is a question of trying to keep proper control, of trying to hold the situation until there a clear picture of how the successor company will develop. But I wonder whether the proposition in the proposed subsection (1C) may conflict with amendment No. 289, which says that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall at all times obtain the best price in disposing of any securities of the successor company."</p></blockquote>
When the time comes when he can get a good price—perhaps the best he will ever get—if he can dispose of only 10 per cent. of the shares at any one time the market could severely worsen before he could sell any more. The injunction to obtain the best price could be totally at variance with the restriction on selling more than 10 per cent. of the securities. I do not know whether that is sound commercial reasoning. Perhaps the Minister would address himself to that point when he winds up. If I am right in that I shall not advance such an argument again because I do not wish to put words into the Minister's mouth. He has his own job to do. I do not wish to do it for him. But I personally doubt Whether the two amendments go together.<br><br>
I now move on to amendment No. 302. In my view it is a critical amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0938">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1729</span>
ment, and for very good reasons. It puts sensible limitations on the proportion of shares that can be offered for sale, with a view to maintaining control.<br><br>
We put forward the amendment because it is the only way that the NFC, when it is transferred to a successor company, can be retained as an "integrated" concern. If all the shares are sold and power passes to the successor board, there is nothing to stop it selling off the constituent parts. If it sells off the constituent parts, it sells off the profitable parts first and is left with a rump which is not profitable and viable and gradually part—indeed perhaps most—of the enterprise is closed down. Then the sharks enter into and dismantle the operation at the seams, leaving nothing—not even wreckage—floating on the surface.<br><br>
If, technically, the Minister can keep control of the successor company with less than 51 per cent of the shares, I would agree with that. I have no experience of dealing in shares, and I doubt whether I ever shall, but I feel sure that one can keep control of any company, provided—that the ownership is sufficiently dispersed, with less than 51 per cent. of the shares. But if we write in 51 per cent. it will screw the lid down on the whole operation.<br><br>
Almost certainly people will enter the market, if the corporation is to be sold off, and buy the shares for the disposal of the profitable subsidiary. I am not clairvoyant, but I make the prediction that, on the purely commercial proposition of earning potential—even with the Minister lobbing in £100 million of public money—there will not be much of a sale for the operation as it stands. I do not think that on the market it will go like a hot cake. I may be wrong, but I do not think so. In my view, the selling factor will be not the price earnings ratio or earnings potential, but what the corporation consists of so that it can be stripped down. That is where the profitability will lie.<br><br>
The potential expansion of the successor company, on the most optimistic view, will still not enough to offer a ready sale of the assets. Potential buyers will look at the capital that can be realised from selling off the old NFC or by putting it part and parcel into an existing enterprise belonging to the buyers. The Opposition believe that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1730</span>
retaining 51 per cent. will ensure control at all times and prevent that from happening.<br><br>
I think that I am correct in saying that at one time the Minister believed in a BP solution for the National Freight Corporation. It is some time since I read "The Right Track," but I believe that it was hinted at in that book. If so, what has prompted him to move from the BP solution to a solution which countenances the whole structure being broken down? What changed his thinking between the time he wrote his book, which was a contribution to the transport debate, and now? Will he enlighten the Committee how he made that progress in thought and what prompted him to move in that direction?<br><br>
My last point concerns amendment No. 302. I believe that with a BP solution, managed in the right way, we can have the best of both worlds. We can bring equity private capital into the concern and have the flexibility that that represents. We could also ensure Government representation on the board, even if the Government did not wish to play an aggressive marketing role in the concern. It will be a good thing to leave the options open. The Government will then have a voice, through the board, to promote what might be valuable lines of transport policy as time goes on. With 51 per cent. of the share capital, the Government would be able to intervene in an unobtrusive way for strategic reasons. That would bring advantages that the Minister should consider very carefully. Such a solution would enable the Minister not only to diversify the capital structure and to make the whole operation less highly geared in fixed interest terms, but to keep open an important avenue for Government investment should it be needed.<br><br>
I believe that those are powerful arguments for the Government to reconsider what we have said. I hope, therefore, that the amendments will commend themselves in spirit, if not in substance, to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments, or at least of some of them, is to achieve the objects that the Minister set himself. On Second Reading he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are not going to be selling off individual NFC subsidiaries to the highest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0939">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1731</span>
bidder. The whole purpose of this Bill is to enable us to sell shares in the enterprise as a whole. We want it to go into private ownership as a single entity, without any major change in size or range of interests."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1129.]</p></blockquote>
In case it should be thought that there was any difference of view on policy between the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, I have checked what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary. On Second Reading, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are not hiving off separate profitable parts of the corporation. We believe that the corporation makes sense as a whole. We are therefore selling it as a corporation and we are resisting pressures to sell off Pickfords and so on."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1243.]</p></blockquote>
I like to take right hon. and hon. Members at their word. Several of the amendments were therefore put down in that spirit, although one of them is not entirely in the spirit of what the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary said on Second Reading.<br><br>
Our object is to restrain the action of the Minister to what he said he intends and to give him no more powers than he needs to achieve his objectives. It is also to protect him and the transport industries from the depredations of the Treasury at any time between now and when he finally starts selling off shares. It is also intended to protect the National Freight Corporation as a transport organisation. In theory, at any rate, both sides of the Committee are in favour of the corporation continuing as a transport organisation. It is also intended to protect the interests of employees who have made such a large contribution to its being a worthwhile asset in the first place.<br><br>
The object of amendment No. 286, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) pointed out, is to ensure, in one respect at any rate, that the Minister comes back to the House each time he intends selling off a tranche of shares, so that we may observe whether he is doing what he said he was setting out to do. That is wholly proper. We have argued the case for the affirmative resolution before, so I shall not go into that any further. We wish to limit the amount of shares that he may sell at one time.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1732</span>
Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said, this may be somewhat in conflict with amendment No. 289. I am sure that the Ministry of Transport, the Treasury and even, let it be said, the merchant bankers advising them about the disposal of these assets have made mistakes in the past. They will make them in the future and may well make them over the disposal of the assets of the National Freight Corporation.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
There are two objectives in seeking to ensure that the Minister at all times obtains the best price in disposing of any securities. First, the first call on those funds is to protect the pensions of the existing National Freight Corporation pension fund. We think that that should be done and therefore that great priority should be given to it. The second objective is to ensure that in this, as in matters which apply to local government and other spheres of public activity, the best price is obtained rather than some knock-down arrangement. After all, fiddled sales of shares are not unknown in the City and we want to ensure that there are no fiddles in this respect.<br><br>
I cannot see why the Minister should object to amendment No. 306 because it is in line with his own stated objectives. It would prevent the Minister, or his nominees, from selling off part of the National Freight Corporation rather than selling shares in it as a whole. I suggest to the Minister that, in addition to its being in line with his own intentions, it has another commendable aspect in that it means that he would have a statutory right to fend off the Treasury if it were to come shuffling in and say "Can you not sell off a bit of the National Freight Corporation because we could do with £20 million of readies at the moment? It would be most helpful if you could sell off that subsidiary or group of subsidiaries." I should have thought that the amendment would have been of assistance to the Minister.<br><br>
In a sense, amendment No. 302 is contrary to the Minister's intention. However, I argue that this is the only way in which he can achieve his aims. He said of late that he wants to dispose of more than half the assets of the National Freight Corporation. That is a conversion. He must have come off
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0940">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1733</span>
"The Right Track" and be on the road to Damascus, because he has certainly changed his view on the question of the proportion of shares that should be held by the Government in future.<br><br>
We believe in principle that the Minister ought to retain more than half the shares in the company in order that there should be a controlling Government interest. That is a matter of party political dispute between us and we cannot expect the Minister to accept that. But if it is really his intention to block asset stripping, and if he really intends the National Freight Corporation to continue to operate as a whole and operate as a freight transport organisation, the only way that he can ensure that it continues as a freight transport organisation in its present conglomerate state without bits being sold off and without asset stripping is by retaining control.<br><br>
The air the Minister expends from his lungs when he tells us that he intends to keep the National Freight Corporation as a whole but not to retain control himself is simply a waste of his breath. It is air that could have gone into other people's lungs. Once the Minister has sold the necessary proportion of the shares, I recognise that he may need to dispose of over 51 per cent.—and once he has lost control of the National Freight Corporation by reducing his shareholding to such a level that someone else gains control, any suggestion that anyone in his position could influence the future of the National Freight Corporation and keep it as a freight transport trading entity is just poppycock. It is misleading the Committee, misleading the House, misleading the people in the industry, and misleading the public generally to suggest that there is any way in which the Minister can retain, or influence the activities of, the National Freight Corporation once it is in private ownership.<br><br>
If the Minister is serious in suggesting that he wants to keep this unit as a separate entity—it is roughly 10 per cent, of the road freight transport industry—because it is a useful size and a fairly economical unit, the only way he can guarantee it is by retaining control of it. We come back to the point on practically every amendment on the NFC we have discussed that if the Minister is not prepared to do that, the asset stripping, which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1734</span>
is rightly to follow, will be his fault and no one else's. It certainly will not be the fault of anyone on the Opposition Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There seem to be two interpretations of the motives behind the amendments. The hon. Member for Hol-born and St. Pancras, South (Mr Dobson) said that the amendments were helping me only to be true to myself, whereas the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr Cowans) said that they showed the philosophical divide between the two parties and said that he would not necessarily expect me to agree with them. Of the two interpretations of the group of amendments I would agree with that of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central. The trouble with most of the amendments is that if the Government accepted them, they would defeat the whole purpose of the legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 286 would place restrictions on the sale of securities in three ways. (1A) would require the affirmative resolution. Our view is that this would be an unnecessary and inappropriate way of handling the matter because the sale of securities is the fundamental objective of the legislation and the whole principal of this would have been exhaustively debated during the passage of the Bill through the House. Therefore we could not agree to that.<br><br>
(1B) seeks to prevent the sale of securities and individual subsidiaries. I believe that that is unnecessary. The essential purpose of the Bill is to enable shares in the successor company to be sold to investors with the aim of transferring control of the enterprise as a whole to the private sector without any substantial change in the size or the range of interests. It is not the Government's intention to bring about the separate disposal of the subsidiary companies. I believe that I have made that point reasonably clear every time I have spoken on the National Freight Corporation and, indeed, in every conversation and discussion I have had with the trade unions, the NFC and all the other interested parties.<br><br>
(1C) would prevent the Minister from selling more than 10 per cent. of securities at any one time. This is unacceptable to me and to the Government because it would clearly stand in the way of the Government's overall object, which is to dispose of the controlling interest in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0941">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1735</span>
successor company. Offering only a small number of shares for sale at any one time would certainly slow the process down and it could obstruct it altogether as potential investors might be unwilling to buy shares if it were unclear whether the Government intended to give control. It would appear from the nods of Opposition Members that it does not come as any great surprise that the Government will seek to resist that amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) had a fair point when he said that amendment No. 286 was incompatible with amendment No. 289 which deals with the best price and requires that
<br><blockquote><p>" The Minister shall at all times obtain the best price in disposing of any securities of the successor company.".</p></blockquote>
That is totally incompatible with (1C).<br><br>
I am sorry to bring about fraternal disagreement on the Opposition Benches. I have to tell the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) that I prefer the view of his hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) on that point.<br><br>
Naturally, we will want to dispose of securities at the best possible price. It is clearly in the Government's financial interests to do so. In any case, there is an underlying assumption with all ministerial powers that they will be exercised in the public interest. But, to the extent that the public interest consists of getting the best price, specific requirements such as this are unnecessary.<br><br>
It is unwise to include explicit requirements in legislation, because it gives rise to endless controversy about what the best price was at a particular time, and what the circumstances were, and that could frustrate the whole process of selling the shares. What might be the best price in one case might not be so in another, and an absolute requirement could, I think, cause great trouble. It might even make it harder to avoid sale in a way that the Opposition might themselves wish to avoid—namely, the sale to the great army of asset strippers with no interest in the business which they believe to be marching on London ready to snap up the NFC as soon as it goes to market. The amendment would be welcomed by them more than by most.<br><br>
The intention of amendment No. 306 is to ensure that the process of transferring control to the successor company in the private sector does not lead to the frag-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1736</span>
mentation of its assets. That is generally agreed to be its purpose, although the wording is not altogether clear. The Government have emphasised consistently that it is no part of our policy to force any changes in the existing size and structure of the NFC. The essential purpose of this legislation is to provide a means whereby the corporation, reconstituted as a Companies Act company, can be transferred to private ownership as a whole. From this viewpoint, the concern which appears to lie behind the amendment is misplaced.<br><br>
The amendment is also unacceptable in principle inasmuch as it appears to involve a degree of limitation of the freedom of the company to dispose of its assets as it sees fit. There is, in practice, no reason why the company should wish to engage in large-scale disposal of assets. That is a point that we have made consistently.<br><br>
Nevertheless, limited asset disposals constitute an everyday commercial activity for all kinds of companies. The NFC has frequently in the past had to sell off property which was superfluous to its operational requirements. The amendment would inhibit the company from disposing of assets at or after the time at which securities were offered for sale. This would be inconsistent with our aim of ensuring that the company has full freedom to conduct its affairs in accordance with commercial requirements.<br><br>
Amendment No. 302 concerns the transfer of control and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall retain at least 51 per cent, of the shares."</p></blockquote>
I think that I have made crystal clear the position of the Government on this matter. I said on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"If we retain an interest, it will certainly be no more than a small one."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1129.]</p></blockquote>
I should like to repeat that. The Government's object in bringing forward this legislation is to transfer control of the NFC to the private sector. I will not go over the Second Reading arguments again, but I am convinced that there is no justification whatever for State involvement in road transport, cold storage, removals and travel. I believe that State ownership has, up to now, denied the NFC the commercial freedom that is open to private sector firms and has shielded it from some of the rigours of commercial discipline. The overall result has not been in the interests of either the NFC or the public as taxpayers.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1737</span>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how he reconciles his two statements? He states that the Government wish to retain a minor shareholding in NFC and, on the other hand—the Minister has repeated this, for which I am grateful—he says that the NFC will remain in its entirety. How can he reconcile those two statements? If the Government retain only a small interest, it is outside their jurisdiction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, at some point this must be a matter for the commercial decision of the new national freight company. I do not run away from that. I can give no guarantee about the future of the NFC over the next 10 or 20 years. That would be to limit its freedom.<br><br>
If it has the commercial freedom—as I believe it should have—to develop in the ways that are best for it, and if control should, as I believe, go to the private sector, clearly the control has to be exercised and decisions taken. I do not pretend that there is any way in which I can control the activities of the NFC after it has become a company and gone out of the public domain.<br><br>
What I can do, however, is to seek to ensure that the NFC is sold as a whole into the private sector, rather than in any other way. That is the only point that I make.<br><br>
Our aim and objective is clear. It is to transfer control, which is in everyone's interest. It is in the interest of the Government and the taxpayer and not least—I come back to this—the NFC itself to get the corporation out of the public sector altogether. As I said previously, there is an important future for the National Freight Corporation, but I believe that that future will be better secured inside the private sector than it is at present. Believing that, I must say to the hon. Gentleman that we cannot accept this group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position is now clear after the Minister's statement. He will agree that there was a misunderstanding on the part of the trade union, for whatever reason, about the role of the company and about whether the Government intended to hold 51 per cent. The Minister has made clear many times, verbally and in correspondence, that that was not his intention.<br><br>
Views have been expressed about the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1738</span>
word "substantial" and about whether it is a small or a majority holding. The Minister has now made it clear, and he must forgive us, as he told us that he has said it before, for not understanding, but I do not think that he spelt it out as clearly in Committee as we might expect. He has more time to put it on record.<br><br>
There is no desire on our part to see this company sold off. If passed, the amendments would make that extremely difficult to achieve—particularly the amendment embodying the requirement that it be sold off at 10 per cent. each time, because the procedures that would have to be adopted to float the price for the shares in the private company would presumably require a large amount of the shares to be made available to some broker who would then offer a price, and by that procedure 10 per cent. would not be attractive on the private market because buyers would be buying into a company the majority of whose shares were held by the public. That is a reasonable argument on the part of the Minister in reply to this series of amendments.<br><br>
If there is a conflict between the amendment that would limit to 10 per cent. and the amendment dealing with "best price", it could be argued that it is the best price under the conditions laid down by amendment No. 286. But we will not enter into a debate on that. Clearly it will not be the best price that the Minister requires, and, as he fairly said, the Bill is designed to achieve the objective of getting the best return by selling as many shares as possible in order to meet the pension obligations talked about in other parts of the Bill and receive as much money as possible for the selling off of public assets. That money would then be given to the Consolidated Fund if there was a surplus over and above the obligations mentioned in the Bill.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Minister, in considering paying those surpluses into the Fund—if there are any after the sale—might not be wise to think about giving them to other areas of transport, such as British Rail, which is desperately in need of such moneys. It might be attractive to consider that any surpluses from a sale should go to other parts of transport which are in desperate need of investment. They should be the prime candidates for the proceeds of such cannibalisation of public assets.<br><br>
The Minister has also made very clear that the reason for the sale is to roll back
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0943">Image</span>

the public sector. That may be an acceptable proposition to Conservative Members but not to us. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of our ideology. We have frequently stated during our debates on the Bill that we believe in maintaining and increasing the size of the public sector. That is a political objective of the Opposition, and there is no need for us to debate the matter now. However, to a certain extent it is reflected in our amendments.<br><br>
The Minister has also made clear that he is certainly not considering keeping shares in order to have control over the direction of the company. The sole purpose in maintaining a unity of companies under the Freight Corporation was to sell them as one single entity. Perhaps a good price could be received for some, while others would be less attractive. But to sell them as one, so as not to be left with a body such as National Carriers, for example, and with its problems, the Government are offering a package—one that is almost cross-subsidised in some ways. The profitable parts are the inducement to buy the others.<br><br>
That is one area of concern to us. The Minister is saying, in effect, "I can guarantee that the corporation will stay as one unit only until the time that it is sold into the private sector." Once a board is appointed and a Companies Act company comes into being, that board will determine the commercial criteria. If the board wishes, for example, that cold stores should not be part of its operation, it may exercise that judgment.<br><br>
Not only will the Minister have no control, he will not even be prepared to intervene in any way.<br><br>
Again, if in the company's commercial judgment National Carriers was a liability—which Ministers felt would be a problem when the National Freight Corporation was first being formulated; grants were given to overcome that—all that would be involved would be the matter of redundancy, with 14,000 jobs lost.<br><br>
The cross-subsidisation principle of a national freight corporation package of companies at least guarantees the employees that they will all be retained in employment. They will not have that under the private company. That raises a further point in respect of the Ministers attitude towards his possible holding of shares. I presume that that will not be a definite policy decision, but simply that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1740</span>
he will not have sold all the shares. After the flotation, if only a certain amount were sold through the brokers, the Minister would be left with the remainder, depending on the broker's or underwriter's judgment concerning flotation and share price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If it were considered helpful at the time of flotation for the Government to continue with a small shareholding, we would take that decision. It would be in that context, rather than that about which the hon. Gentleman is talking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That raises more questions. Will it be necessary for a broker to consider that the Government are required to sell so many shares? Will that be an assurance to the company? Because the Government are involved, they may be able in 1981 to reconsider the possibility of the grants that the Bill is designed to stop? What will be the advantage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The advantage would be that, as I believe, National Freight has a good and prosperous future, and the Government should show that in a positive way by retaining a shareholding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now I am becoming confused. The test of whether it will be a good bet is whether people buy the shares. Why they have to be convinced that the Government have a holding before they buy shares is difficult to understand. Either it is a good commercial prospect or it is not.<br><br>
Indeed, the whole purpose of the Bill and the Minister's declared intention is to get the Government out of their majority shareholding position, so that people will be assured that they will not have control. If the shareholders then control 80 per cent. while the Government hold 20 per cent,. presumably they will be assured that they have the security of up to 20 per cent. of Government money, without there being any Government influence over commercial decisions.<br><br>
If that is the case I do not understand the position of a public investor. The Government are acting in such a way as to disfranchise the right of the public in having a say over commercial policy decisions. If any person buys a share in a company he wants to have his say as a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0944">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1741</span>
shareholder. For example, the corporation's workers may want to buy shares—I do not know whether they are queuing up for them. I have not heard much about that lately. Let us suppose that they go mad and acquire perhaps 1 per cent. of the shares. They may decide that they want some influence in a dispute over a commercial decision about whether National Carriers is to be sold. That would not be an outrageous possibility. The company may say, "We shall do this because we have decided that it is the best commercial policy".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am open to correction, but I can see nothing in any of the amendments or the clause to say that all the shares must voting shares, as distinct from non-voting shares.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have made a fair point, Mr. English. However, let us assume that the amendments with which we are concerned, particularly that which mentions the 51 per cent. majority shareholding, will mean that the Government are to have control over the company's policy decisions. To follow that argument through for a moment, if the workers violently disagreed with the management on policy but did not have sufficient shares, and the Government were holding 20 per cent., what would the Government's position be if the workers asked them to use their 20 per cent. to back them? That may be the single largest holding in the company. In those circumstances, that can be a powerful influence. Will it then be the Government's policy no longer to interfere with commercial judgment, as the Minister said?<br><br>
However, if the company were being broken up those shares would not be used to any effect to oppose that policy. If that is so, there would be no guarantee to the</span></p>

<p>workers in the Bill that they would have the security of working in one entity—that is National Freight. The possibility that I have raised certainly could occur.</p>
<p>As a contribution to the transport debate, the Minister referred to the BP solution in the pamphlet "The Right Track". Clearly, behind that was the involvement of private capital in a company in which the Government held a majority of the shares. It is interesting to note that the Government again made clear that they would not interfere in the commercial decisions of BP unless those decisions were against the national interest. They then appointed directors to the board, so as to reflect the number of shares held by the Government in that company.</p>
<p>The Government seem to say that they will hold shares because of the security that that gives. It is interesting that a broker may ask the Government to hold shares in the company because that represents some security for National Freight. The same sort of copper-bottomed support through Government ownership is still wanted, together with the freedom of the company to do as it wishes in respect of commercial policy. Yet here we could have a Government with many shares refusing to play any part in that policy.</p>
<p>That is certainly not to the advantage of the taxpayer, who may have a 20 per cent, holding. He does not have a particularly good deal. He has no influence, because the Government have disfranchised him.</p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p>With all the difficulties of the amendments, we see every reason to support them to guarantee to the workers that there will be control over the selling off of assets.</p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a number of difficult, complex and related issues on which the Minister could usefully advise us. Clause 37 clearly empowers the Minister, subject to Treasury control and veto, to give directions as to the nominal value at which this public asset shall be sold. I therefore ask how he and</span></p>

<p>the Treasury will determine that nominal value. I presume that that value will be different from the value of the commencing capital debt and the outstanding loans of the corporation—that is to say, it will not be £100 million, although the power is there to direct that it should be £100 million.</p>
<p>Am I right in believing that some assessment, estimate or valuation will be made of the whole of the NFC as a going concern, assuming that all its subsidiaries are operating, and that at that point the</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0946">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1745</span>
<p>Minister, working with the Treasury, will take a decision about how that estimate should relate to nominal value with a view to maximising the public return? We believe that it would be possible for the Minister, even having voted against a commitment to maximise the return, to be told by the Treasury that he should still attempt to maximise the return.</p>
<p>We appreciate, of course, that one does not necessarily get the maximum return by maximising the nominal value of the shares that are to be floated or even the total equity shareholding of the Government at the point of float, but it would be useful to have the information now. Without memoranda and articles of association and without knowing the financial construction of what is to be sold, it is almost impossible to make a sensible judgment on the provisions of clause 37. We do not know, for example, how much of the initial share capital will be pure equity shares. We do not know how much may be fixed-interest convertible shares. We do not know how many shares will carry voting rights. All that information is hidden from us.</p>
<p>It would have been better if the Minister had agreed that the matter should be subject to further procedure in the House instead of arguing that we could debate it exhaustively. Unless information is forthcoming which has been hidden from us up to now, we frankly shall not know.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may help on that point. The right hon. Gentleman may be thinking that he will get a specific reply, perhaps at our next sitting.

It would be unnecessarily inhibiting to give those details at the moment.</span></p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will understand that even if there is shortly to be a break in our proceedings it will not be possible for us to come forward with information, if by information he means a specific commitment now to the form of the capital structure. I have tried in recent debates to give some indication of the sort of consideration that will affect the Government in the final judgment when the Minister has to determine the capital structure, as the Bill empowers him to do.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that the Parliamentary Secretary has told us previously that it is his intention, and that of the Minister, to retain that degree of flexibility. I believe that he said that the Government have not worked out what, in their view, should be the form of capital construction. The point that I make is that the Minister has said that he does not want any form of parliamentary control over the sale. Therefore, there will not be an opportunity for Parliament to have this information before making a judgment on the control.<br><br>
The possibility of control through retaining sufficient shares has also been rejected. It seems that we are left in a most unsatisfactory position. I was intrigued by the argument that the reason the majority of the shares should be sold off was that it would be far more attractive to the purchasers. Presumably the Minister's logic is that the Government handle the concerns that they control so badly that the private shareholders will not want to get their hands on shares unless they can be certain that by their doing so the company will move out of Government control.<br><br>
That is highly unsatisfactory. We are faced with a clause which contains no form of control, and with the possibility of the Government deciding on a construction as yet unknown.</span></p>
