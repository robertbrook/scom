UNFUNDED PROPORTION OF RELEVANT PENSION OBLIGATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 329, in page 42, line 3, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In determining what proportion of the relevant fund obligation of each BR or NFC pension scheme has not been funded the Minister shall use the same economic assumptions for every pension scheme subject to the determination".</p></blockquote><br><br>
Its purpose is to avoid the danger of discrimination between British Rail and the National Freight Corporation pension schemes in so far as the Minister will determine the proportions to be covered by funding or by pay-as-you-go.<br><br>
I attach considerable importance to this aspect because I realise that there is a whole series of conflicting requirements and considerations which the Minister may have pressed upon him when he makes those determinations. It must be established that once a solvency standard has been adopted for one pension scheme, or a set of pension schemes, the same should be applied to others.<br><br>
As regards the National Freight Corporation, one of the considerations which will obviously be in the Minister's mind is how far prospective purchasers of shares will be satisfied that the funded proportion is adequately funded and, if they felt that it was not adequately funded, how far they might be influenced on what they would be prepared to offer for the shares. Therefore, it might be argued that the Minister had some eye to the effect of the value which a prospective purchaser would put upon a public asset by making a favourable assumption for the purchaser of the shares—that is, making sure that the proportion set to be covered by existing funding was on the low side.<br><br>
On the other hand, it might be argued by those with a long experience in his Department of dealing with British Rail
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2026</span>
pension funds that, if there was a collapse of the funded section in the pension funds administered by the railways, pressures would be brought to bear upon the Minister in the future to make some other financial arrangement. No matter how strongly that idea might be rejected now, with the passing of the years there can be changing views about provisions for railway pensions. The Bill bears eloquent testimoney to that proposition.<br><br>
There is, therefore, only one completely fair, equitable and reasonable proposition that we can adopt on this issue, and I believe it should be embodied in the Bill—namely, that the same economic assumptions should be made for all of the historic railway pension rights schemes, whether they are administered by British Rail or by a successor company of the NFC.<br><br>
The wording of the amendment has been chosen carefully and deliberately not to place any restriction on the Minister as regards assumptions other than those of economic output. I appreciate that the rates of death and retirement can vary from one scheme to another, and that the demographic pattern or profile of membership of schemes can vary. Clearly that would have a bearing on the appropriate fund proportion. But it would not be limited by the amendment, which requires only that the economic assumptions should be the same for every pension scheme. It avoids a fear—or suspicion—which would otherwise exist of some preference being given either in respect of the NFC, because those are funds that will pass into the hands of a private company, or other presumptions such as those that I have mentioned. Therefore I hope that the Minister will be able to accept not only the amendment but also the spirit behind it.</span></p>
<p>The Minister of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be able to give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he requires, although I am afraid that I am not able to accept the amendment as it stands. At present, the amendment requires the Minister in determining the unfunded proportion for BRB and NFC pension schemes to use the same economic assumptions for each scheme.<br><br>
I should like to start with a word of history. Before the negotiations with British Rail on the amount of funding debt to be provided under the Railways Act 1974 were suspended, both sides had been pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2027</span>
ceeding on the basis that the same economic assumptions would be used in the valuation of each scheme. But during the negotiations the BRB actuary suggested that it might be appropriate to use different assumptions for different schemes since they differed in the term—that is, the average period until maturity—of their liabilities.<br><br>
The amendment does not specify what is meant by "economic assumptions". That might cover, for instance, assumptions made about redundancies or future growth in earnings. Prima facie, the assumption about the rate of return on investments is economic. In the negotiations about the amount of funding to be provided under the 1974 Act it was common ground that different rates of return might be obtained by different funds.<br><br>
That was because there were technical reasons why different funds would have different investment policies. That argument was advanced by British Rail's actuaries. Therefore at a technical level, different assumptions may be necessary for different schemes. Circumstances are different in respect of such matters as retirement age, promotion rate and staff turnover. But technical assumptions shade into more general assumptions, and the amendment would create unnecessary difficulties in valuation.<br><br>
I do not believe that there is any reason to suppose that significantly different assumptions about economic trends will be used for different schemes, but it would be wrong to lay down that exactly the same assumptions would be used as the circumstances and liabilities of the schemes are not uniform. The amendment would remove the flexibility that is needed.<br><br>
Behind the amendment lies the quest for an assurance from the Government that there will be no distinction in treatment between BRB and the National Freight Corporation. On that, I should like to give a clear assurance that we will be adopting the same general assumption for both sets of schemes. In both cases we will aim to achieve settlements that are equitable to the taxpayer on one hand and the board of the successor company and the pension funds on the other.<br><br>
Therefore, the NFC will not be favoured in any way in the arrangements. Second, we give a full assurance that there will be no discrimination against British
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2028</span>
Rail funds. I hope that with that assurance and for the reasons which I have given, the right hon. Gentleman may feel it appropriate to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate the difficulty that the Minister raises in connection with the word "economic" in the amendment. It would, of course, be possible to frame the amendment in more precise terms. For example, one could say that the assumed rate of inflation should be the same for one set of pension schemes as for another. One could say that the assumption about the earning rate of shares should be the same. That would be within the spirit of the amendment. One could even mention assumptions about public service pension increases, which have a bearing on the amount which will have to be paid out by the pension funds. However, I assume that public service pensions will be assumed to be the same in both cases.<br><br>
That leaves me with the argument about share interest. That is the only factor where there can be a significant difference. There is no doubt but that there will be considerable problems. Those who administer the funds have made arrangements on the assumption of income from the Government which they will not now have. They have assumed that large amounts of funding will be paid to them between now and 1985. Therefore, understandably, some trustees responsible for the administration of the funds have invested money to give a good return beyond 1985, when funding will not be forthcoming. They will have to rearrange and use considerable skill in placing that money to produce an earlier return. They will probably have to sell shares at a time which is not ideal. That will be forced on them by the Bill.<br><br>
Therefore, it is, surely, reasonable to argue that if the Minister accepts the principle of equality of treatment between one group of pensioners and pension fund trustees and another, he should accept, first, that the assumption about the inflation rate must be the same. If one accepts the principle of parity of treatment, there can be no justification for saying that for one group one inflation rate will be assumed, and for another group another. There can be no justification for making a different assumption about the rate at which public service pensions increase.<br><br>
I agree that the shares of one group
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2029</span>
could perform better than those of another. Share interests are a matter for the judgment of the trustees. In my opinion, it is not right or proper that the Minister should make assumptions about the ability of one group of trustees to manage their shareholdings better than the other. Both must make a considerable readjustment in the shareholdings of the funds, and both must exercise their skill on behalf of their funds to give the maximum protection. Some may do better than others, but one cannot say at this stage that some will do better than others because they happen to administer funds in respect of those who work in NFC, or that some will do better because they happen to administer funds in respect of those employed in British Rail. So I think that the principle of parity of treatment is established. However, I still feel that it is highly desirable for it to be written into the Bill.<br><br>
I should not want to break down on the argument on the definition of the word "economic". If the Minister thinks that it is fairer to specify those one, two or three instances where he undertakes that there will be equality of treatment, I shall be prepared to withdraw the amendment with a view to the tabling of an amendment by the Government or the Opposition on Report which will specify that the assumptions shall be the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There appears to be very little between the two sides of the Committee on the issue. During the negotiations over the amount of funding to be provided under the 1974 Act it was common ground that different rates of return might be obtained by different funds. I understand that it was British Rail's actuaries who argued that different assumptions might be appropriate for different schemes. The terms of liability as well as the average period to maturity differed.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The average age of pensioners differs between schemes. For example, in the new section the average age is 65, in the amalgamated sections it is 74 and in the B.R. (1974) pension fund it is 77. That demonstrates the differing terms of the liabilities. At a technical level, different assumptions may be necessary for different schemes because the circumstances are different. The Government's view is that the position is fully covered by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2030</span>
assurance that I have given. However, that need not deter the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) if, having considered what I have said and perhaps wishing to take advice from those affected, he wishes to come back at Report stage. That is a question for him. My advice to the Committee is that the position is fully covered. I do not think that at this stage we need to go further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When introducing the amendment I referred to the factors leading to the different assumptions just mentioned by the Minister. I made it clear that the amendment was not intended to tie the Minister's hands with regard to those factors. I and my hon. Friends appreciate that there are differences of demographic patterns in the membership of schemes, and that they have to be taken into account in how great a proportion of any scheme can be covered by existing funding. That is accepted. There is no difference between us over it. The word "economic" was chosen with a view to excluding such factors.<br><br>
However, if that does not go far enough I do not wish the amendment to break down on those grounds. In the circumstances it would be better to formulate between now and Report stage a wording that clearly excludes those factors. I wish to have an opportunity at some stage to press again the contention that there should be absolute parity of treatment over assumptions about share performance, the rate of inflation and the effect of public service pension increases. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

PROPORTION OF PENSIONS WHICH CORRESPONDS TO RELEVANT PENSION BLIGATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 331, in Clause 46, page 42, line 37, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Before confirming or varying the said determination the Minister shall consult the persons administering the pension scheme concerned about the proportion he proposes to specify in the said order in respect of the scheme, and in the event of those persons giving notice in writing to the Minister within two months that they object to the said proportion, the Minister shall appoint an independent actuary, to be nominated by the president for the time being of the Institute of Actuaries, to report before the end of the second financial year on the proportion which would be appropriate and the Minister shall thereupon by order confirm or vary the proportion so as to give effect to the said report.".</p></blockquote>
The need for the amendment arises from the defeat last Thursday of the proposition that there should be an opportunity during the course of the running of the pension scheme proposed in the Bill for reviewing the proportions as between the funded and the pay-as-you-go sections. That was rejected in a debate which did nothing to encourage us as to the value of some of the assurances previously given to those administering pension schemes. In tabling the amendment, we were particularly conscious of what the Parliamentary Secretary said on Second Reading.<br><br>
As reference has been made to the nature of the assurance given in the letter of 7 December 1977 sent by the Ministry of Transport to those responsible for the administration of the British Rail pensions, I shall quote two passages from it. They are entirely relevant to our discussion of the amendment. First, the letter stated that the valuation to be made arising from the Railways Act 1974
<br><blockquote><p>"will be freely agreed by all the parties involved—the Government, the Board, and the funds—on the basis of the actuarial advice available to them".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2032</span>
Let there be no argument about this. That undertaking was not written into the 1974 Act, but was given subsequent to the Act. We are now dealing with a period subsequent to that in which there could have been an adjustment in the amounts to be guaranteed by way of funding.<br><br>
The letter went on to deal with the situation which would be brought about if the Government sought to move in response to the questions posed by the Public Accounts Committee as to whether it was desirable to change from a fully funded scheme to one which might not make such a large immediate call upon public funds. That part of the letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, if policy were to be changed in the light of this review one must, I think, assume that this would be done in such a way as to leave the position of members and pensioners of the funds as secure as it is now, in other words if the change were made the security which is effected by full funding would be replaced by some other equally effective security for the membership."</p></blockquote>
That letter therefore contained two assurances. First, it said that the appropriate sum to be paid on funding would be freely between the three parties. That is a very different situation from that proposed in the Bill, which gives the Minister the right to settle any dispute as to whether the amount proposed and the proportion is appropriate. Secondly, the letter gave the assurance that if the Government moved in response to the Public Accounts Committee's criticism, they would do so in a way that gave equally good protection to the pension fund membership. I do not believe that we can equate the proposition in the Bill with those two assurances.<br><br>
It is one thing to say to those who are running a fund "When you have totally agreed with us what the appropriate funding is, it is your responsibility to see that those pensioners are looked after." It is quite another to say "If we disagree with you on the appropriate portion to be covered by funding, we shall determine it for you, whether you like it or not. But you will still be responsible for seeing that the proportion to be covered by the funding
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1104">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2033</span>
is adequate, and if it is not, you will have a duty to those pensioners." That goes to the heart of the reasons for the amendment, because it is an entirely different proposition.<br><br>
To his credit, the Parliamentary Secretary has always been extremely frank about this aspect of the Bill. On Second Reading he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The actuarial basis is being considered and we hope that it will eventually be agreed between the Government, the Board and the unions. But we cannot guarantee that. Someone has to decide, and actuarial judgments involve a matter of opinion in the final analysis. Certainly at present we would hope to reach agreement, if we can, on the actuarial basis."</p></blockquote>
But he went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is absolutely no threat to the pension rights of the railwaymen who are affected by these historic rights provisions."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 1239.]</p></blockquote>
But he made clear all along that, in the last analysis, the Government could decide.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary's statement on Second Reading is very different from what was stated in the assurance in the letter dated 7 December 1977. That said that, on the basis of the 1974 funding scheme, the appropriate amount would be freely agreed between the parties.<br><br>
In the light of that assurance, it is reasonable for us to expect that if there is a disagreement at some time in the future, there should be outside arbitration on an impartial basis in order to ensure that that undertaking is not breached. If it cannot be freely agreed, I can see only one way in which the settlement could be fair and be seen to be so. That would be if it went to an impartial outside arbitrary body. This proposition is in keeping with the 1977 undertaking. I think that the Government owe it as a duty to those who are having thrust upon them this considerable responsibility for safeguarding the pensions of a large number of pensioners on an entirely different financial basis from that on which they originally undertook that responsibility, one on which the amount of money agreed is no longer within their direct influence, because they will no longer have the assurance that they will operate on an agreed sum. All we ask here is that at least they have the assurance within the Act that if it is not an agreed sum, it will be one that is independently arbitrated.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2034</span>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should point out that on a narrow view, in the context of clause 46, the amendment is inappropriate, although I shall go on to deal with the general issues raised by the right hon. Member.<br><br>
Clause 46 deals with the matter of how each year Ministers will determine how much should be paid in respect of the unfunded proportion of each scheme. This is not a process for which any kind of arbitration will prove necessary in practice because it will be a matter of fact each year how much of the outlay under a specific scheme is referable to the unfunded proportion determined by the Minister.<br><br>
Having listened to the right hon. Gentleman, I think that his amendment would have been better directed to clause 45, because he is really arguing about the first determination of the proportion that is unfunded in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Point taken.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this whole question of the status of the 1977 letter has vexed members of the committee for some time, as has the basis of the actuarial assumptions on which the first determination of that unfunded proportion will be made, and what is to happen in the event of disagreement.<br><br>
We are following quite precisely in the Bill the pattern laid down by the 1974 Act. As the right hon. Gentleman conceded, the Act laid down that in the end the responsibility for determining the basis upon which the various funding orders should be made was the Minister's and his alone. In practice, under the 1974 Act there was the closest consultation between the Minister and his advisers and the board and fund managers to try to reach agreement on appropriate sums for funding.<br><br>
In December 1977 a change was made in the basis of funding for the No. 4 funding order. At that point, the reassuring letter to which the right hon. Member referred was sent by an official of our Department. The letter stated that when it came to the grand revaluation, as it is described, for the final funding orders, the Government intended that the basis for the valuation would be freely agreed by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2035</span>
all parties involved. But I see no distinction between what was stated in the letter and the kind of undertaking that I gave on Second Reading.<br><br>
The position now is that the Government will seek to agree the actuarial basis upon which the unfunded proportion is arrived at. Naturally, we expect to continue the close contact that has existed between us and the fund managers, and at the same time we shall be acting on advice from the Government Actuary. But it there is no agreement, in the end someone has to have the responsibility, and a decision has to be taken. We propose in the Bill to adopt exactly the same position as in the 1974 Act, so that in the end it is the Minister's responsibility to make the determination.<br><br>
In the unhappy event of agreement not being reached, that will have to be the position. But it still means that the Government will seek to make an honest determination of the right actuarial basis. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we shall act in good faith, and, in particular, on the advice of the Government Actuary, in making all the required economic forecasts to come to a proper actuarial conclusion. I suggest that it is rather fanciful to say that there are real fears that somehow the fund will be cheated or deprived of a proportion of the support it deserves because somehow the conclusions have been made in an underhand way.<br><br>
I do not accept that this is a suitable matter for arbitration. In the end, all an arbitrator will have to do is to listen to both sides and then make his own actuarial assumptions and judgments of the various economic factors and either adopt one or other of the competing approaches or perhaps come up with a third, different judgment of the correct proportion. These things are essentially in the end a matter of judgment. As I said earlier, there is a certain art in making the many assumptions that actuaries have to make about the future performance of investments and liabilities and so on. Given that substantial sums of public money are involved, it seems right that in the end the Minister should make that decision. It should not depend on agreement with an outside body or arbitration by yet another actuary brought in to preside over disputes between the Government and the board.<br><br>
I cannot take the issue much further.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2036</span>
We discussed it fully in previous debates. I do not accept that there is a real problem. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be reassured about what I said concerning the basis on which the Government seek to act, and that in end our disputes over the point will prove to be academic. I trust that eventually it will be possible to reach complete agreement with the trust managers and avoid the disputes that the right hon. Gentleman fears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary should say that the fears are fanciful. They are very real for those who have the difficult job of administering the funds. Had there been no fears over the difficulties of running funded schemes based on the Government's judgment—and made under their actuarial valuation—they would not have given the assurance to which I referred. That letter would not have been sent.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that the fears are peculiar to this proposition in the Bill, but that they are almost inherent to the situation which exists in that inflation rate and interest earnings, and so on, will have to be projected far ahead to see whether the funding will be all right. Those fears applied even before the Bill was brought forward.<br><br>
I put it to the Committee that, given the proposition in the Bill, those fears become greatly intensified, because funding will be cut off abruptly on a certain day instead of going on over a considerable period. Secondly, fears are intensified because the assurance of agreement on appropriate funding apparently is being withdrawn by the Bill. That assurance is not written in. Therefore, the desirability of arbitration arises. I should like to make clear that that was not the first course chosen by the Opposition. We argued that there should be far greater flexibility and opportunity to reopen and re-examine the matter from time to time when sufficient water had flowed under the bridge to see whether the assumptions made were correct.<br><br>
That brings me to the third point. The fears arise in part because of the conviction of a number of people, including myself, that the Minister is taking on an almost impossible task of making a prediction about the proportion of the fund against the will of those who have to run it and then of making it stick. They must

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2037</span>
live with it, take financial responsibility for it, and consider their obligations to the pensioners.<br><br>
The reason why the proposition can stick under existing legislation is simply that there is an agreement about how funding will be determined. It is one thing to say to someone with whom a free agreement has been reached "Right, you will now stick by that because you have agreed it with me. It is your responsibility as much as mine." But it is quite another thing to do what the Bill proposes and say in circumstances where the Government disagree with those responsible for running the fund "We shall decide on the basis of our actuarial advice, whether you like it or not, and then you must stick with it." That is the difference.<br><br>
Those circumstances would not have been of our choosing. We should greatly have preferred the opportunity to reopen</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee on the clause. The Parliamentary Secretary made the valid point that the principle contained in the amendment was more appropriate to early clauses. We appreciate the fact that he addressed himself to that aspect because the principle is important. The vote gave us an opportunity to conclude the point. As has been explained, the clause is really the machinery; the dirty deal was done somewhat earlier in the Bill.<br><br>
We are debating not whether one is hanged, but at what date and time. So we shall not prolong the argument. We are dealing with a mechanism. We should not disagree with the proposal that the Minister assess the proportion of the fund each year. Therefore, this is solely a mechanism by which the principle is implemented.<br><br>
The point that concerned us greatly was put by my right hon. Friend the Member</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2038</span>
<p>and re-examine the matter from time to time, so that assumptions could be checked with advantage to both sides. One advantage would have been to the taxpayer, if the assumptions had been over-generous to the fund, and another would have been to the fund, if they had proved to be hard on it.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, which would have been brought about by the Government's refusal of any re-examination and by their determination to be finished with the matter once and for all on a basis that they can control, I believe that the arbitration proposition is most reasonable.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 10.</p>
<p>for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). We wished to make clear that this was a secondary approach. Our purpose was to adopt the same principle as that embodied in the 1974 pension legislation. When there is a funded scheme, there should be an assessment. That may be to the advantage of the taxpayer if there has been an over-assessment or to the pension funds if the liabilities are found to be greater than assets and the proportion determined for the unfunded part of the historic pensions.</p>
<p>We seek only to make the point that it is a secondary principle—that is, a sort of fall-back—for an independent actuary to be involved in making an assessment. What we are really talking about, as we have determined earlier in the Bill, is a contract between the pension authorities and the Government concerning the proportion of liabilities that will be faced by each party. The point was made clear by my right hon. Friend. We certainly shall not oppose the clause, as it is clearly just a mechanism. We want to leave it now, so that we may go on to debate the rest of the Bill and perhaps to return to the matter on Report.</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a simply query, but it may not produce a simple answer because there may not be one. I should like to know the consequences of subsection (2). We have been concerned about the unrectifiability—if that is the right word—of some of the assessments and decisions. It appears to me that subsection (2) would prevent an error being corrected. If
<br><blockquote><p>"any class of the relevant pension obligations and their funding have, by virtue of subsection (2) of section 45, been left out of account in making a determination"</p></blockquote>
under that section by accident, error or oversight, it appears that the error would have to be carried forward into determinations made under clause 46. That is absurd. I hope that the Minister will agree to look at this subsection to ensure that that does not bind him to perpetuate an error made under clause 45.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) said on clause 46 was absolutely correct and on the ball. Needless to say, we do not regard it as the dirty deal which was done earlier. It is certainly true that whatever was done earlier, that was it. The clause is, basically, an uninteresting piece of machinery concerning the calculation of the amount of the historic outgo of the fund. The Minister's liability is to pay the unfunded proportion of the historic pensions outgo, and the clause is designed to ascertain the historic pensions outgo itself.<br><br>
The amount of the historic pensions outgo will be ascertained by reference to the facts and the definitions of the Bill. I see no reason to suppose that calculations will be a source of dispute; nor do I believe that that is a point which has been made at any stage of our deliberations.<br><br>
The clause undoubtedly looks complicated, but so much of this pension legislation looks that way. The exact historic outgo will not be known until after the end of the financial year concerned, when the audited accounts are available. Until then it will be necessary to approximate, and clause 43 provides for the necessary adjustments of payments when the approximations are replaced by final figures.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) referred to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2040</span>
subsection (2). It is consequential to clause 45(2). These provisions were inserted at the request of the British Railways Board to enable fully-funded historic obligations to be treated as non-historic.<br><br>
As I said, this clause is entirely mechanical. I do not consider it to be controversial, and I advise the Committee to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was a purely technical one. The Minister's response suggests that the British Rail pensions administrators, who, after all, in the dim and distant past were reponsible for the present execrable state of the schemes, and the Ministry of Transport are incapable of making errors. History demonstrates that both those august bodies are only too prone to error. Therefore, it is highly appropriate that there should be a let-out in clause 46 if an error is made under clause 45.<br><br>
I accept the principle that if anything is excluded under clause 45 it should be similarly treated under clause 46. But if it is done by mistake, or not done properly, it is odd that we should pass a law which will perpetuate the error.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be the last to deny—and there are British Rail representatives watching this debate who will share this view—that mistakes could be made by either of those august bodies, as the hon. Gentleman kindly described us. The rationale for the subsection is entirely a matter of administrative simplicity. It is envisaged that it will be used mainly where different classes of historic obligation overlap. For instance, the historic obligations of the board in relation to the British Railways superannuation fund include obligations to pay ante-dated contributions in respect of members who have opted to ante-date their membership of the fund. There is really nothing for the hon. Gentleman to fear. As I sought to explain, the provision is entirely mechanical.</span></p>

REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTATION SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2041</span>
ment No. 333, I should like to indicate to the Committee that I have been reconsidering the selection of amendments for the clause in the light of amendment No. 343, which is starred. I should not normally regard it as appropriate to call a starred amendment. However, I understand that because amendment No. 334 is defective, the Opposition have had another shot at it and that No. 343 is on order. Unless the Government have any objection, I therefore propose to select amendment No. 343.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to you, Mr. Dean, for your advice on the selection of amendment No. 343.<br><br>
I beg to move amendment No.333, in page 43, line 21, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) If the actuary to the basic scheme certifies that the liabilities of that scheme exceed its assets the aggregate amount of the payments made under 41(1) to the persons administering the supplementation scheme shall be increased for each financial year beginning after the date of the actuary's certificate—
<ol>
<li>by the aggregate amount for that year of such of the increases mentioned in subsection (1) as first became payable after that date; or</li>
<li>if less, by the same proportion of that aggregate amount as the proportion (if any) certified by the actuary to be the relevant proportion of those increases.".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
There are two quite remarkable propositions in the clause. The first is that, in spite of everything that the Government have said about not reopening the question, in spite of their insistence up to this point in the Bill that once the funding proportion has been determined, there it shall remain, here we see written large and clear that in certain circumstances that question definitely will be reopened with regard to a certain group of schemes. That is the first proposition. It shows how audacious the Government are. They certainly have horses for courses and arguments for clauses. On previous clauses their argument was that there must be absolute certainty about funded proportions. That argument now goes out of the window. When we come to supplementation schemes it is forgotten. Presumably we shall now have to listen to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary telling us about the virtues of flexibility and of being able to reconsider.<br><br>
The second outstanding proposition in the clause is even more breathtaking—namely, that the question will be reopened only in a way that will allow the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2042</span>
Government to reduce the pay-as-you-go payments. The reopening shall not operate in such a way as to allow those payments to be increased. Therefore, we have two staggering propositions to consider.<br><br>
The Opposition—eminently reasonable as ever—have decided not to challenge the principle of reopening the question. We shall not call upon the Government to be consistent. In the face of such propositions, that would be too much to expect. In any case, we should like to see a greater degree of flexibility. We wish there to be opportunities to reconsider the determination of proportions in the light of a few years' experience. We shall not imitate the Government's total inconsistency of approach. We shall attempt to stay with our basic judgment—that it is desirable to reopen the question at certain times, to see how funds are performing and to see whether the liabilities exceed the funded income.<br><br>
Our amendment, therefore, says that we shall go along with the proposition that the question should be reopened in relation to one particular group of schemes, but on a fair and equitable basis. If the Minister is to have the right under the clause to require that the balance of the supplementation schemes be examined from time to time, if an actuary is to certify whether the assets exceed the liabilities or vice versa and if the Minister wishes to have the power to reduce the pay-as-you-go element to the extent to which assets exceed liabilities, in the event of the liabilities exceeding the assets he should increase the pay-as-you-go element by that amount. That is a perfectly fair and justifiable proposition which might have wider application under the Bill, but I assume that it would not be in order to discuss that now.<br><br>
There will clearly be considerable sensitivity in this area, as the purpose of the schemes is to allow increases in pension rates which would not otherwise be possible. In a period of high inflation, that is an important aspect of pensions arrangements. People realise that if their only entitlement is a basic predetermined amount, inflation may greatly devalue their pensions. They therefore look very closely at whatever provision is made in the schemes of which they are members in order to be sure that arrangements of the kind provided by the supplementation schemes will operate on a sound basis.<br><br>
It is for the Minister to say what leads
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2043</span>
him to believe that the funds will produce more than is required to meet the cost of increasing pension amounts. On the principle, there can be no doubt. If the Minister can find an acceptable distinction allowing him to reopen these schemes but not others, such reopening must be on a fair and equitable basis. If the schemes are found to be producing more than is required to meet the call upon them and the Minister is to have the right to reduce the pay-as-you-go amount, it is only fair that if the reverse is found—if the liabilities exceed the assets—the Minister should in a completely even-handed way increase the pay-as-you-go element. This will provide an element of flexibility which might be even more desirable on a wider application. However, if it is to apply only to these schemes, it must apply on a fair and equitable basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In general, I support my right hon. Friend's objections to the clause. I believe that it is wrong in principle for the Minister to seek to take into account any current surpluses which may arise under the schemes. This is partly because it puts a ratchet on the arrangement. The Minister has graciously announced that the pension schemes have no hope of getting him to reconsider his initial assessments. He is adamant that they will be current for 30 or perhaps 80 years. Yet if surpluses become available in the supplementation schemes, he wants to be able to adjust for those as they arise.<br><br>
That is a remarkable set-up, particularly as the average actuarial assessment takes place on a triennial basis. The proposal effectively tells the pension fund managers that if they lose, they lose, but if they gain, the Government will take. The Government's proposal is a "heads we win, tails you lose" arrangement. This has been a recurrent theme in the Opposition's comments on the pensions provisions.<br><br>
The Government are allegedly dedicated to the concept of incentive. Yet these pensions provisions provide no incentive whatever for the pension fund managers to do their job properly. This proposal would indeed provide a further positive disincentive, in addition to the disincentives and the sense of irresponsibility that the arrangements under clause 45 will bring to the future of railway pensions. The Government's proposition is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2044</span>
wholly deplorable.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I shall not go into detail on the points raised by the amendments in this group. I believe that the whole principle of the Government's proposal is wrong. If the Minister is not prepared to accept adjustments in the arrangements under clause 45, it is wholly inequitable to claim this right to review under clause 47.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My first reaction to the amendment is that the wording is particularly obscure. I say that with no disrespect to the draftsman, as we are dealing with a fairly obscure part of the Bill. Nevertheless, I had the greatest difficulty in understanding what on earth the amendment was driving at. I am not sure that even the explanation given by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has made clear to me exactly what he is driving at. However, as both the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) widened the matter considerably, it might be convenient to introduce our discussion on this and later amendments by touching on the whole basis of clause 47. That seems to be what is really troubling the Opposition.<br><br>
It is important to realise that clause 47 deals with a comparatively limited number of schemes in which the pension entitlement depends upon two sources—a basic scheme which governs the benefits at retirement date and a supplementation scheme covering annual index-linking thereafter. Two supplementation funds have been established under previous legislation. They are the B.R. (1974) pension fund and the National Freight Corporation (1978) pension fund. There is therefore a limited number of schemes in which the basic entitlement is set by the basic scheme and thereafter supplementation is paid out of one or other of those schemes.<br><br>
Clause 47 deals with the situation in which the basic scheme fund produces a surplus. The clause is concerned with what is a fair use of the surplus produced by the investments of the basic fund. Having listened to the speeches, I realise that there is a belief among the Opposition, which is understandable when one first considers the arrangements, that somehow the Government are trying to have their cake and eat it, that we seek to vary the rules the moment any fund looks like going into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2045</span>
surplus compared with the attitude we have taken to the matter of fund managers meeting their obligations out of their investments generally.<br><br>
However, an examination of what I might call the 1974 settlement shows that that is not actually the case. Up to 1974, there were a number of schemes which set out a basic pension entitlement for which they had some funds, but in which, in practice, over the years, it had become customary and, indeed, expected that each year there would be supplementation to update the benefits in line with inflation. There were no funds that could properly cover that annual index-linking. It had become the practice to pay for it out of revenue, but that was becoming increasingly difficult and expensive for the railway. Indeed, the inability of the railway to meet its obligations in this and various other ways was the whole basis for the 1974 Act. Therefore, in 1974 the Government took on the obligation to pay out of a fresh fund the annual supplementation, whereas in the past the railways used whatever small surpluses there were in the funds and made up the difference with revenue.<br><br>
Since 1974, as we know, there has been a continuing high rate of inflation. The result is that the Government's payments for the index-linking of pension rights have been considerable. At the same time—again because of inflation—the investments of the basic scheme funds have in some cases done quite well. Because of inflation, the Government's obligations to supplement the pension benefits have been considerable. The apparent earnings in money terms of one or two of these basic schemes—one in particular—have been considerable.<br><br>
Inflation has caused the Government's liability to index-link and to produce a surplus in the basic scheme. Therefore, I suggest that it is appropriate to say that in meeting their obligations to supplement, which arise out of inflation, the Government are entitled to look to the unexpected additional income which is produced in the basic scheme.<br><br>
I see that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), is not persuaded by that explanation. However, since 1974 individual pensioners have acquired a guarantee, which they previously did not have, backed up by a fund financed by Government, that their pension rights will be index-linked. That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2046</span>
not by any means a facility which is available to all pensioners in the private sector. As a result of the 1974 settlement, they have obtained a substantial additional benefit for which they make no payment. I see no justice in saying that, given that inflation has also produced windfall profits to the basic scheme funds, they should be entitled to the full benefits of those profits as well without making any contribution out of the surpluses produced by inflation to their additional benefit. There is a case for saying that, where the Government are saddled with the obligation of index-linking, they should look to surpluses being built up in the basic scheme to make a contribution towards that index-linking liability.<br><br>
It is better to leave until discussion on later amendments—including amendment No. 343 which you, Mr. Dean, have just indicated that you are disposed to select—consideration of whether all the surpluses in the basic schemes should go towards supplementation or whether there should be some division or sharing of the benefits of the surpluses and the liabilities of index-linking.<br><br>
Amendment No. 337, seems to concern a rather narrow proposition in the basic framework that I have just described and sought to defend—namely, the problem of what would happen if one of the basic schemes which produced a surplus suddenly went into deficit. It is necessary to consider in what circumstances that is likely to happen. Those circumstances will be the mirror image of those I have just described as prevailing over the past six or seven years. Instead of a high rate of inflation, which is likely to produce a surplus on the basic schemes, there may be a low or declining rate of inflation with a low return to the scheme and at the same time a low obligation to supplement. Circumstances likely to produce a decline in the surpluses of the basic scheme would at the same time be almost certain to reduce the Government's liability to index-link the benefits. Therefore, I suggest to Opposition Members that the arrangement contains its own self-correcting mechanism and it is not necessary to write into the Bill a legal requirement to produce a situation which will be produced in practice, if ever we return to a low rate of inflation, smaller surpluses and a smaller obligation to supplement.<br><br>
I could point out that the wording of the amendment as it stands is defective.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2047</span>
I am assured that it is not just my inability to comprehend it by the choice of language which makes it very difficult to know what its exact legal consequences would be if it were written into the Bill. However, I prefer not to rely on technical points. I am sure that it would be possible to correct drafting errors and reach an agreed form. I suggest that we are discussing a most unlikely situation, and that if it occurred the situation would correct itself. There is no need to write surplus wording into the Bill to cover the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has a marvellous defence mechanism. If one tables an amendment to the Bill to change it from gobbledegook into plain English, he produces the lawyer's argument that precision is more important than elegance of language, or even comprehension by mere mortals. If one tables an amendment in the terms of the Bill, he chooses to ignore that, and says that the amendment is terribly obscure. I invite the Parliamentary Secretary, for a few moments, to read subsection (2). He will find that our amendment uses the same mechanism of Parliamentary draftsmanship and wording that he has used in his clause. If our amendment is defective and obscure, it is as defective and obscure as the Bill. If our amendment is crystal clear, it is because whoever drafted the Bill has made that crystal clear, too.<br><br>
I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to some extent. The amendment is obscure. But at least in the amendment we have used the same degree of obscurity or clarity as the Bill. We are trying to be completely fair.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary addressed himself to the argument only in the last part of what he said. He acknowledged that the amendment deals with the circumstance in which the basic scheme does not produce the surplus which could contribute towards the supplementation. We are talking about the circumstances in which the basic scheme has not enough to cover its liabilities, let alone to contribute anything towards supplementation. Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary must be wrong in saying that there is a self-correcting mechanism. He is wrong, certainly, in the technical sense that the Bill makes no provision for a mechanism in one set of circumstances. It certainly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2048</span>
makes it in the other. It is arguable whether, in the circumstances he described, there is an automatic adjustment as a result of the movement of the inflation rate. What determines whether there is surplus or deficit in the basic schemes is not purely the rate of inflation. It is the relationship between the rate of inflation and the level of interest which these schemes receive on their funds. If their interest return runs ahead of inflation, they will certainly produce a surplus. They are basic schemes, therefore the pension liability does not alter. They have a fixed liability and earnings which go up if inflation pulls up interest rates with it. If, on the other hand, interest rates go down, then, as this is the basic scheme, there will still be no drop in liabilities but there will be a drop in the income from which they can be met. So there is no guarantee that those who run the combined pensions and supplementation funds will have anything whatever to make up in circumstances where the Minister does not increase what I call broadly the pay-as-you-go element.<br><br>
11.45 pm<br><br>
I am informed that any calculations of the fund interest made under the 1974 Act would probably take into account a proportion of the existing surpluses of 1979. But under the Bill the Government's support payments would take account of a proportion of future surpluses as well as existing ones. I agree that we are working on proportions, so to this extent under the Bill those who have to administer the pensions are in a much worse position than under the 1974 Act.<br><br>
The Parliament Secretary defined fairly his terms of reference. He said that he could draw a distinction between these and the other schemes for which there is determination as to the proportion to be funded, because these basic schemes are there only in circumstances that require supplementation, the principle being that if they were not basic, supplementation would not be required. What they produce is for the same pensioners. Therefore, his argument is that it is reasonable that if they produce more than is required for the basic pension, they should contribute supplementation because it is the pension of the same group of pensioners. That is a fair and persuasive argument, but it must have within it the potential for the proposition in the amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2049</span>
If, in determining how much the public should put in, we consider them together as a public liability and a public contribution, in order to ensure that where the basic scheme is in surplus the public put in less, it is reasonable that in circumstances—admittedly rare, as the Parliamentary Secretary said—where the basic scheme does not produce sufficient, there should by the same token be an increase in coverage.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary may not like the language, and I go along with him. So let subsection (2) be written in a clear and unambiguous way, and let us also correct the amendment so that it is equally clear and unambiguous. He would not have been justified in trying to rest on the language, which, to be fair he did not do. But he has not addressed himself to the justice of the proposition, which seems to stand virtually unassailed.<br><br>
If one gives these basic and supplemental schemes special treatment because they are basic and supplemental, and linked, it should be done in a manner which in the majority of cases will be of considerable advantage to the public in that they will not have to spend as much on supplementation. When there is a fall of income to the basic scheme below what is required for its liabilities, this should be met by an increase in supplementation in order that there should be fairness and equity in those narrow categories which the Minister has defined in the Bill as appropriate for separate treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that I would not rely on the argument that our gobble-degook is better than the Opposition's, but there is a striking similarity between the language of the clause and the amendment. Basically, my argument is that I do not think that this would in practice arise, but that is not a firm rebuttal in principle. Rather than extend the argument on this narrow point, I shall look at it again to see whether it will do any harm to cover the position in the Bill to ensure that the division of surpluses and deficits between the taxpayer, on the one hand, and the fund, on the other, would be totally fair, if such an eventuality arose as the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) predicts. I shall see whether a clearer form of words can express both the Government's intention and the aim of the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2050</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I indicated earlier that I proposed to call amendment No. 343. We now come to that amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 343, in page 43, line 26, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that in no case shall the proportion exceed 50 per cent.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment was obviously tabled in advance of knowing what would happen on the previous amendment, so I say at the outset that if the previous amendment has been accepted, albeit in language that was understandable to mere mortals, amendment No. 343 would cease to be important. But this amendment now has considerable importance, because it raises the question of how much the surplus should be retained.<br><br>
I do not think that we know sufficient about these pension funds to know to what extent retention of a proportion in one fund could help those who have responsibility for the overall administration of other basic funds. But it seems only simple fairness that if the Government are to be able to take part of the surplus for something that they now fund, in this case the basic scheme, which is in surplus, they should not be able to take more than a reasonable part of it if they expect those who are responsible for basic funds that run into liabilities to carry the full liability.<br><br>
This is, in effect, a minor safeguard provision. But we propose that if the main point is not met by consideration of the preceding amendment, where a fund is in surplus the proportion to be taken shall be limited in circumstances where, if a fund is in deficit, no contribution or allowance is to be made in the funding of the supplementation scheme. That is the narrow issue on which the amendment is based and it is of importance only if there is not to be equity of treatment of the main proposition of the preceding amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of getting at cross-purposes on the amendments. I hate to put the right hon. Gentleman off abandoning a point on which he

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2051</span>
was satisfied on the previous amendment, but I think that this amendment covers a quite separate issue.<br><br>
May I deal with it this way? To introduce the proportion issue, I take it that this is actually concerned with the proper division—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the problem of untangling issues. I hate to prod the right hon. Member to get on to his main point, but we ought to have a debate on the proper division of surpluses that arise.<br><br>
As I indicated on the last amendment, there is clearly a case for taking the major benefit of these surpluses to meet the obligation that the Government have taken on towards the pensioners to give them an annual index-linking of their pensions, since otherwise there would be an extremely fortunate windfall for members and pensioners who would find that inflation was producing in a few cases healthy surpluses for their funds. They would not have to donate them to the index-linking, and, no doubt, it they were allowed to get away with it they could use those healthy surpluses to put up steadily the real value of the benefits each year. Unfortunately that would neither be fair to the taxpayer not a sensible use of the surpluses.<br><br>
For the reasons that I gave when touching on this in the last amendment, and given that inflation and the general economic climate of the past few years has reduced a heavy burden on the taxpayer by way of index-linking it is right that the first call on any surpluses on basic funds should be to meet that index-linking of benefits.<br><br>
There is a case for saying—one must consider the matter in the light of earlier representations and of the amendments including the defective amendment No. 334—that devoting 100 per cent. of the surpluses to the cost of supplementation would take too much of them for the taxpayer's benefit. One reason why the basic schemes are building up surpluses is that the valuation of benefits at retirement age is not so closely linked to inflation as is the performance of the funds. They are rather old-fashioned pension schemes and the calculation of benefits varies between basic schemes, but the benefits that are won by retirement age are not so closely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2052</span>
linked to inflation. As I said, it is often because of the performance of the funds.<br><br>
Of course there are many members who are still in employment and not yet at retirement age who make contributions to the funds which all the time are helping steadily to build up funds to earn the surpluses. From their point of view, that is winning for them during the years up to retirement age no improvement in the benefits that they can expect. There is also the point that if 100 per cent. of a surplus is taken away and used for cost supplementation there is no incentive for fund managers bothering to continue with producing surpluses over and above the limited basic liabilities of the scheme.<br><br>
For all those reasons I am able and glad to say that we are prepared to look at the question of dividing up the surplus so that a proportion can go to the basic scheme—and no doubt be devoted to an improvement of pre-retirement benefits —and at the same time a proportion can be taken by the Government to meet the cost of supplementation that they are bearing. The amendment suggests a 50–50 proportion—which is a rough and ready approach—and to split the difference. But that does not seem to me a fair division, because the basic cost that arises is that of supplementation and index-linking for pensioners.<br><br>
That is particularly true in respect of the membership of most of the schemes. They are very old schemes; some of their names go back to the pre-grouping—pre-1923—days of the railways. So it is not surprising to find that in almost all cases the number of pensioners in retirement greatly exceeds the number of members still in employment and making contributions. Therefore the payment of index-linking to benefits in payment greatly exceeds anything that is accruing to the funds by way of contributions from present members.<br><br>
I suggest that a proper division is about 85 per cent. of any surpluses going towards the cost of supplementation and 15 per cent. being retained by the basic schemes and available to be devoted to the improvement of benefits for those still in membership. Exactly how the figure is arrived at should be open to discussion. It is probably best debated between those who advise the Government and the pension funds as to what the division will be in each scheme.<br><br>
I have suggested the 85–15 split as the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2053</span>
proportion that should be agreed between the parties. I believe that it is more defensible than the 50 per cent. mentioned in the amendment. I hope that I have reassured the right hon. Gentleman that on the basic issue of dividing up the benefit of any surpluses we are prepared to meet the argument in principle, at least, and to get down to discussion on precisely how best to divide those. No doubt the rest can be left to negotiation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was obviously guilty of a very grave over-simplification in what is a very complex area of the Bill. I spoke to the amendment on the assumption that either the total or a set proportion would be available. To that extent I should qualify what I said previously. If a calculation is made in respect of the previous amendment it will be on the presumption that the same proportion is to cut either way. If, for argument's sake, it is 50-50, and only 50 per cent. can be taken from the surplus of the basic scheme to put into the supplementation scheme, in the event of a deficit only 50 per cent. of it should be added to supplementation to cover the combined schemes.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
With that qualification now stated, I go on to the more direct purpose of the amendment. It is clear from what the Parliamentary Secretary just said that it is common ground between us that it would be unsatisfactory for the Minister to determine in each case as it arose, without any parliamentary guide or sanction, the amount to be taken from a basic scheme surplus to go towards a supplementation scheme. That could lead to a number of pensioners being worse off than they would have been under the Railways Act 1974, which left the money there to improve the basic scheme payments at certain times.<br><br>
I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary's definition of the basic scheme liability is better than mine. I accept that the benefits are not fixed. The extent to which they vary is not the extent to which a directly inflation-linked pension scheme would vary in its payments.<br><br>
The figure of 50 per cent. included in this amendment is based on the principle that for most of the old funds one-half of the contributions were paid by members, and the other half by the employers. If that is accepted as a reasonable distribu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2054</span>
tion of liability, it is only fair that 50 per cent. should be retained in a form which can give benefits to the basis scheme.<br><br>
We are not necessarily talking about small contributions by pensioners. In some cases they are considerable. For example, I am informed that one of the schemes which is in surplus at present is the LNER section of the British Railways superannuation fund in respect of the members who were admitted to that fund on or after June 1957. The surplus in that case could be around £15 million. That would provide some substantial improvements to the pensions provided by the schemes. In view of that, the percentage adopted is important to members and pensioners in the scheme. It would be a harsh judgment that in a scheme where pensioners have put in 50 per cent. of the money, 85 per cent. of surplus should be available to meet a purpose not outlined in the basic scheme.<br><br>
Therefore, if too high a percentage of the surplus is offset against Government support payments many pensioners will feel, with some justification, that their position has been worsened. On the other hand, I agree that if too low a percentage were adopted the members and pensioners would be placed in an unduly favourable position compared with those belonging to other pension funds. There is, therefore, a balance to be struck. The right balance, bearing in mind precedents, would be around the 50–50 mark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be difficulty in arriving at the right figure whatever view one takes. We all agree that it is fair that there should be a division between the taxpayer and the pension fund. However, it is extremely difficult to find clear guidance as to what would be a proper division. The right hon. Gentleman explained that he had arrived at the 50–50 division by starting from the view that 50 per cent. of contributions were from members and 50 per cent. from the board. I do not see that that has much relevance.<br><br>
Of course, the funds are usually made up of both employers' and employees' contributions. And at the end all the benefit goes to the employees by way of pension entitlement. As thing stand they are getting for their contributions an entitlement according to the rules of the basic scheme and also, nowadays, a Government guarantee of index linking for such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2055</span>
benefits once they come into payment. They never had that before. It is a definite and most valuable benefit. I do not see why the employees should not be liable to contribute to that new benefit just as employers are. The fund may well have been built up on a basis of contributions split 50–50 between employers and employees. But that does not give much guidance as to what should be the proper division of the surplus on the basic scheme funds as between the Government, which has to meet the cost of index linking, and the fund, which has to meet the cost of the basic entitlement.<br><br>
I have tried to indicate a better approach. First, there has to be some division so that fund managers have an incentive to produce the best performance possible from the funds for the benefit of members. Second, let us examine the position of beneficiaries. If there are injustices in not allowing some of the surpluses to be retained, the worst are in the case of members who are still paying contributions and have done so since 1974. The economic climate has changed since 1974. If their fund had done well they may have expected that basic entitlements under the rules of the scheme would have been steadily changed to produce steadily better benefits at the date of retirement for those members who were still contributing.<br><br>
That approach has led me to suggest that 85 per cent. to 15 per cent. would be a fairer division of the proceeds—if there are any—of the old basic schemes. I did not say that I thought it necessary to write what the right hon. Gentleman described as parliamentary guidance into the Bill. I was not suggesting that it was necessary for the Bill to specify a fixed proportion of any kind. Indeed, I should hesitate to insert such a fixed proportion. I was indicating what policy the Government intended to pursue. Once such a policy is pursued I assume that successor Governments will feel bound to follow it and divide up the proceeds between the Government's liabilities and the fund according to the proportions now decided.<br><br>
I hesitate to write the policy firmly into the Bill for the following reason. It is possible that the right division for every scheme may be a crude one—85 per cent. to the Government and 15 per cent. to the scheme. However, my argument is that one should look particularly at the inter-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2056</span>
ests of members still making contributions as opposed to those of pensioners now being paid index-linked benefits. That would lead to a different division in the case of each scheme. I said earlier that in most of the old schemes there are vastly more pensioners receiving payments than there are members making contributions. For instance, it is not surprising to find that the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Pension Fund has no members still making payments, whereas we believe that in 1978, 564 pensioners were receiving payments from it.<br><br>
However, in the case of the most important section—the LNER section which, as the right hon. Gentleman said, is producing large surpluses, the proportions are rather different. The LNER old section has vastly more pensioners than members. I do not know what the up-to-date figure is, but I accept that the LNER new section surplus is pretty big. No doubt, the right hon. Gentleman's guidance was obtained from the fund managers. The latest figures on that section that I have date from 1978. Then there were 1,081 pensioners receiving payments but also 3,043 members making contributions. Plainly, that is the explanation for that fund's producing monster surpluses in relation to its liabilities.<br><br>
The logic of what I have been saying is that it would be best to leave some flexibility as between one scheme and another so as to determine a fair proportion overall and to do justice to the interests of members as opposed to those of pensioners. My suggestion would benefit those making payments at present to the LNER new section which is producing the surpluses.<br><br>
There is a stronger case for steadily improving pre-retirement benefits for present contributors to make sure that they derive some real advantage from their contributions than there is for improving pensions in payment to those who have not contributed for many years.<br><br>
I prefer to leave all that open to negotiation. I am suggesting that overall we should seek to achieve roughly an 85 per cent. to 15 per cent. division between Government and pension funds of the overall surpluses of all the basic schemes. It may be that those who manage the funds prefer a crude 85 per cent. to 15 per cent. division in every case. If they do, I am sure that the Government would agree to that. But if we leave it open it will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2057</span>
possible to have discussions and see whether they prefer an approach that looks at the respective interests of members and of pensioners receiving payments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has fastened on to the issue on which we should like to concentrate with regard to the surpluses of the LNER. Do not such exceptions mean difficulties if one attempts to have one general rule? The Parliamentary Secretary has made a reasonably fair point about that argument. I recognise that he believes that incentives and surpluses are essential. Therefore, he is almost bound to have to make a decision about how best to feed incentive and at the same time have equitable distribution.<br><br>
In the case of LNER any formula —whether it be 50–50, 100 per cent. or 85 per cent. to 15 per cent.—will lead to certain anomalies. The Parliamentary Secretary has shown that the largest surplus is in the LNER fund. Because of the split that took place in 1957, far more people in that scheme are working than are receiving pensions. High inflation means that those people are contributing considerably to surpluses. What would be the Government's attitude if the managers of that fund wished it to be more flexible than the general 85 per cent. to 15 per cent. ratio? Would it move nearer to 50–50, or what? If the Parliamentary Secretary has flexibility in mind, presumably he has some idea of what would be a more favourable position? What is that position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was putting forward only one possibility. I lack the expertise to give a perfect account of all the details. In addition, there is no commitment on the part of the Government to any particular method. We prefer to have discussions on the subject.<br><br>
I was suggesting that the logic of most occupational pensions schemes is that one contributes while in employment to one's own pension entitlement. That is usually the basis of contributions. Once one has retired and ceased to contribute, one's benefits are fixed. Thereafter, with luck, one may get index-linking, as with the funds in question. But one does not expect the real value of the benefits to be increased. That principle has been applied for many years across the range of occu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2058</span>
pational pensions in both the public and private sectors.<br><br>
I shall follow up the logic of what I have said in the most extreme case, that of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway pension fund, to which so far as I am aware there is no one still contributing. The logic of what I said is that nothing would go to the fund by way of surpluses, and that 100 per cent. would come to the Government, because the major obligation now is to carry on index-linking all pension payments. If one went to the LNER new section—I do not know what the mathematics is—it would mean that the Government would take a lot less than 85 per cent. Perhaps the division would be about 70 per cent. to 30 per cent. Seventy per cent. would go to the Government to meet the index-linking from which all the members, even those paying now, would benefit. It is right that they should pay something towards it. I have no idea whether my mathematics is right; I suspect not, because the LNER new section appears to be much bigger than the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railways fund. I just give a broad indication that the Government would be happy to negotiate and discuss all these matters, working on the basis that we believe that the correct division across the board is 85 per cent. to 15 per cent., and we should be prepared to discuss any scheme whereby, in the end, the division of the total surpluses for all basic schemes was roughly 85 per cent. to 15 per cent.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I accept the position which has just been underlined by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) about the position of most people, in the LNER new section in particular, who are still making weekly contributions which are helping to build up these surpluses. We are happy to look at a way in which they could obtain some advantage from that. It would continue to improve their prospective retirement benefits in the years up to retirement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I approach the issue in a different way from the Parliamentary Secretary. I believe that it would be completely wrong for the Government to say that they will have a general figure of about 85 per cent. to determine what they can take from a surplus of a basic scheme, where they will fund the supplementation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2059</span>
scheme. I think that it would be wrong for two reasons. First, the Government have said that they will not, by this proposed legislation, worsen the position of the pensioners, or of the schemes, for that matter. Since, under current legislation, the Government have the overwhelming liability of the supplementation scheme, if they take money from a basic contributory scheme to fund what is at present their liability, they must be worsening the position of the basic scheme and of its members.<br><br>
The Government cannot have it both ways. If they say that they want to worsen the position of the pensioners to improve the position of the public so that they will no longer carry so much of the supplementation scheme, at least that is a proposition. But they are not saying that. They are saying that they are not worsening the pensioners' position—but here is a proposition which would clearly worsen that position.<br><br>
The other reason why I think that the position outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary is completely wrong is that he says that the Government should be in a position to take money that people have contributed for one purpose and use it for another. The money that people contributed on a basis of 50 per cent. from the employee and 50 per cent. from the employer was contributed on the clear understanding, and probably under the contractual provision, that that was available for the basic fund, and therefore they had every right to expect that if it ran into surplus, at some stage the benefits that flowed from the basic fund would be improved. They had no reason to suspect that money contributed by them in the past to the basic fund would at some time in the future be used to reduce the Government's liability for the supplementation scheme.<br><br>
My philosophy of pension funds would make my criticism more hostile. I believe that the idea of a 50 per cent. contribution from the employer and 50 per cent. from the employee is one of the great financial myths. It is to the performance of the industrial unit, to which the employee contributes as much as anything else, that the fund must look for what is called the employer's contribution. But that is a view that is not necessarily generally held. But the first view I expressed is generally held, namely, that if one contributes to a pen-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2060</span>
sion scheme one has every reason to expect that the contributions will be used only in that scheme. In this Bill, and this clause in particular, the Government seek to break with that principle and, in my opinion, to break a contractual obligation to the members of a scheme to ensure that the money contributed is used specifically for the scheme, There could never have been an expectation of what is now proposed. The proposals are, therefore, quite wrong.<br><br>
May I put to the Parliamentary Secretary a slightly different proposition. If he believes that there is virtue in flexibility, will he at least be prepared to give an undertaking that the Government will not take more from the basic scheme surpluses, or will not take a higher proportion, than the proportion which is regarded by convention as the employers' contribution, and leave the employees' proportion? If not, what possible ground do the Government have for justifying taking money contributed for one purpose and using it for another to reduce their legal liability under the 1974 Act? Present legislation requires the Government to fund the supplementation scheme, and it is that which will be reduced under the proposals now advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot take the right hon. Gentleman's last proposition. He obviously believes that the members of the fund will suffer a grave injustice, but that is not the case. They are deriving the considerable benefit of having index-linking for a scheme which otherwise could not conceivably index-link their benefits. The taxpayer has stepped in to provide probably the most valuable addition to benefits that anyone ever contemplated, and it must be beyond the wildest dreams of those old railway men who worked for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway when the scheme was first set up. I cannot see why the entire employees' contributions should be devoted to yet further umprovements in the scheme, or that the taxpayer should not expect any contribution from the surpluses that have been earned. I do not, therefore, accept the right hon. Gentleman's proposition.<br><br>
It is wrong also to suggest that we are changing anything compared with the 1974 Act. Before the Government announced their intention to introduce
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2061</span>
legislation to amend the 1974 Act, the Department had on several occasions made clear to the board that in calculation the amount of funding debt to be made available under the 1974 legislation, account would have been taken of the surpluses in these old funds.<br><br>
I thought that we were agreed that there should be a division of the spoils when surpluses were created. The logic holds now, and equally to the old arrangements under the 1974 Act, and it would have been applied. We are restating, and putting into a different form, the Government's position under the 1974 Act.<br><br>
I am pressed for undertakings. I am able to undertake that the Government will seek no more than 85 per cent. of the surpluses towards supplementation. I am able to offer that. We are prepared to discuss with the fund managers, which includes trade union representatives who will also be involved as they are on the various management committees of the funds, the way in which they wish to divide the surpluses. But I see no logic in going further to 50 per cent. as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 43, line 42, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The Great Eastern Railway New Pension Fund and New Pension (Supplemental) Trust Account and the North Eastern and Great Eastern Superannuation Societies and Pensions Funds Joint Trust Account shall not be regarded as BR pension schemes for the purposes of this section.".</p></blockquote>
The two trust accounts referred to in the amendment exist not to pay pensions but to provide financial support to certain other pension schemes. It follows that surpluses on those accounts cannot be distributed directly to members or pensioners. Therefore, there should be no cut-back in Government support arrangements on account of such surpluses. If Government support were cut back, the members and pensioners in underlying funds would suffer because there would</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2062</span>
<p>In these inflationary times, one must look at the value that index-linking represents. It is no small advantage for the contributors to these railway schemes. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) is amused by my undertaking to take no more than 85 per cent. and feels that such a division is a bit stiff. There are many members of private pension schemes who, if the Government offered to take on an index-linked obligation which they did not have, would readily agree to give 100 per cent. of any surplus produced by their schemes from now to kingdom come. It is not, therefore, an ungenerous offer.</p>
<p>I therefore ask the Committee to leave the Bill flexible, on the Government's assurance that their policy will be not to seek more than 85 per cent. of surpluses towards supplementation costs.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

<p>be no way in which the cuts could be restored to them through distribution of the surplus on the trust accounts.</p>
<p>This is a narrow issue but one which bears directly upon the whole question of how surpluses are to be used and how funds are to be made available. These two special schemes were designed to ensure that funds were available for other pension schemes. They should therefore be regarded in that way.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation of the amendment. I have followed the argument closely and I understand that the two trust accounts do not pay pensions as such but, apparently, make payments to the other underlying schemes to enable them to meet their obligations. The question that my brief does not answer and that I am still asking myself is: so what? If they produce surpluses, I am not sure why the nature and

origin of those surpluses, is any different from those with which we have already dealt. As I understand it, the members of the basic schemes to which the contributions are made will have the benefits of supplementation provided by the Government, I therefore do not see why surpluses produced by the two trust funds should be different in nature from those in relation to basic schemes.<br><br>
Therefore, for reasons that I gave on the previous amendment, I believe that there should be a division of those surpluses along the lines suggested. Unless the right hon. Gentleman can produce fresh arguments as to why these surpluses are of a different nature, when the benefit in fact goes to members who receive their basic scheme entitlement plus supplementation provided by the Government, I do not feel able to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The distinction is that these funds cannot pay directly to the members. They pay to other funds. If the amendment is carried, the Government's powers under clause 47 will still bite upon those other funds. Therefore, to the extent that the funds look after supplementation, that will be a relief of the Government's obligation to do so. To take away from these schemes would simply reduce their ability to carry through a purpose that the Government would wish to see achieved.<br><br>
In any case, the schemes are in a different legal position. They exist for the clear and specific purpose of supplementing other pension funds, which will themselves be caught by other provisions of the Bill. That would seem to be an adequate control, from the point of view of public financial prudence, in respect of those other schemes which are to be the recipients of payments from these funds.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Parliamentary Secretary sees himself as Scrooge or Shylock. We have his allegedly generous decision not to take more than 85 per cent. of the surpluses, but will he not in fact be taxing the funds twice over in this case? Having taken his 85 per cent. at the first stage, on funds which cannot be paid out but can only be paid into another fund, he can then take 85 per cent. of any contribution made to a surplus on the schemes into which the funds are paid. That would clearly be double
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2064</span>
taxation and seems quite absurd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes an ingenious point. The right hon. Gentleman says that these funds are different because they do not pay the members. They pay other schemes which then pay the members. Those members receive the benefit of supplementation in the same way as members of other basic schemes.<br><br>
In so far as we take 85 per cent. of the surplus of these schemes, I agree that that may reduce the surplus of some of the other basic schemes. However, I believe that the basic schemes in question are largely ones in which the assets have been quite exhausted and which therefore require the two trust funds in order to be provided with assets at all. It is therefore possible, I suppose, that we are taking our share of the surplus at one stage and therefore there is less surplus to take at a later stage. All that leads me to the conclusion that we are really splitting hairs and that there is no basic difference between surpluses on these funds and surpluses on other schemes with which we are concerned.<br><br>
One further point arises. The argument on the last amendment was that a high proportion of surpluses should be kept in the funds of the basic schemes so that those surpluses may be distributed by way of improved benefits to the members. These two trust accounts, of course, do not have any members and therefore cannot improve benefits to them. They therefore remain happily in surplus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has hit on exactly the point which bears upon this and the following amendment. The distinction is that these funds cannot be distributed to members, whereas the others can. On the other funds, of course, the Minister could lose money, if I may put it crudely, which would otherwise be available to deal with supplementation. But there is no way in which those who run the funds referred to in the amendment can decide to have some kind of share-out, a Christmas bonus or divvy arrangements to individual members. They can only pay the money over to the other funds, which are then caught by arrangements that one might regard as necessary. I do not wish to play devil's advocate, but I assume that the Government wished to ensure that money could not be paid out as benefits on the

basic fund but would be available for use in supplementation.<br><br>
To that extent, one can draw a distinction. In this amendment and the following one we are dealing with funds that cannot be distributed. They are available only for payment to other funds that are caught within the provisions of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly a point. Perhaps the best approach to the matter is contained not in this Bill but in British Railways legislation which seeks to change the rules to amend one or two old schemes that at present do not allow for any distribution to members and which are something of an anomaly in modern circumstances.<br><br>
However, I prefer to leave the Bill with the basis—this goes back to my first general argument—that inflation has increased the Government's obligation to</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 336, in page 43, line 42, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) Where a basic scheme has no power to distribute surplus this section shall not apply.".</p></blockquote>
This amendment does not raise any new principles. It has, however, a rather wider application and is of a slightly more general nature than the previous amendment, as it covers not only the two trust accounts that were mentioned but also any other pension schemes where there is no power to distribute.<br><br>
I believe that it would be valuable for us to have the chance of pursuing the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary. If in its pension legislation the British Railways board were to go chasing the Government in the Bill and then seek to write a power to distribute into the rules of the schemes, there would be no real advantage from the public's point of view. Surely, it would be better that schemes with no power to distribute but able to pay into another fund—this is what we wanted in the previous amendment —should do that for those purposes.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2066</span>
<p>supplement. At the same time, it has been the major contributor to the surpluses that one or two of the schemes have built up. Therefore, it is only fair that an appropriate proportion of the surpluses should go to the Government for the benefit of the taxpayer and to relieve part of the cost of supplementation.</p>
<p>I shall re-examine the point that was made about the inability to distribute. But my initial reaction is that British Rail has under its legislation from time to time updated the rules of its old schemes. Perhaps that is better than our seeking to amend the Government's basic approach to surpluses.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 10.</p>
<p>If a reasonable proportion is to be taken to reduce Government-taxpayer liability to supplementation it should apply in those ways. However, that proposition has been defeated, so we turn to one in which we argue that generally the power to distribute should be what exempts a scheme from this catch provision. I believe it to be an inferior way of proceeding and that the previous course was much more precise. It would have ensured that the only way in which the fund could serve a purpose would be by paying into schemes.</p>
<p>However, we are talking about basic schemes. Therefore I assume that, by definition, there are supplemental arrangements built on them. In that case, when they cannot distribute surpluses directly—I take it, although I have not checked, that money can be made available as supplementation only to pensioners who are in receipt of the basic pension—as I see it there can be no advantage to the taxpayer or the Government in taking part of the surplus. It is providing something that the Government would have to provide in any case.</p>
<p>The book-keeping exercise is being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2067</span>
reduced. If the Government have the power to cream off part of the surpluses they will be taking them with one hand and paying them back with the other through supplementation schemes.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is a problem which arises from the rather outdated rules of the schemes. As they stand, there is no power to distribute any surplus to the benefit of members. I am told that British Rail has been taking powers to remedy that in Private Bills. My old favourite, the London, Brighton South Coast railway fund, is being amended by a British Railways Bill that is currently before Parliament to provide a power to vary rules on benefits when a surplus is produced.<br><br>
However, I do not accept that we should enshrine the anomaly by amending the Bill as the right hon. Gentleman suggests and exempt those curious schemes which have no power to distribute surpluses. An alternative method is for the Government to table an amendment which would empower the trustees of the basic scheme to pay the relevant proportion of pension increases from the scheme or to indemnify the supplementation scheme when they would otherwise not have the power to do so.<br><br>
Such an amendment would not compel them to do that but would put trustees in the same position in relation to clause 47 as those of any other basic scheme. If the right hon. Gentleman is content to accept an assurance that at an appropriate later stage we shall table an amendment to do that, perhaps he will be content to withdraw this amendment and give us time to draft ours before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested would be an improvement in respect only of those schemes where there is no power for a general distribution through the basic scheme or power to make payment to a supplementation scheme with regard to members of their funds. To that extent, I welcome what the Parliamentary Secretary said, and for that reason I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. But I still feel that while schemes operate only to support other schemes—particularly the first two which we discussed—the legislation is an inferior way of dealing with matters. It is making funds available to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2068</span>
Government in a way that deprives the schemes of a provision that I believe to be highly desirable. But in the light of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee but there is one small point of principle that is bugging me to a certain extent.<br><br>
The Government are saying they will take a proportion of surpluses in the schemes because they feel that extra liabilities have been brought about by extra benefits on some of the schemes.<br><br>
The Minister seems to recognise that it would perhaps be totally unfair to take the 100 per cent., but does not accept that a 50–50 share is right. He has asked us to look at the 85–15 split. There is no commitment; he is merely indicating his thinking.<br><br>
We have discussed certain anomalies. The Minister said that what influenced his decision in considering the 85–15 division was that in some pensions, such as the Brighton scheme, there are more pensioners than people paying in. But in the second part of the LNER scheme, which was split in 1957, the opposite is the case. It is the one identifiable scheme in which there are considerable surpluses.<br><br>
The Minister was good enough to say, without committing himself, that in that instance there should be more flexibility, and spoke of a figure of 70 per cent. Again he gave no commitment, he merely tried to indicate that that was a logical possibility. So the pension fund managers might have to negotiate with the Government on the problem of flexibility as against a firm principle so that they understand what might happen in the future.<br><br>
What would happen if in their approach to the Government, the pension funds had to consider the make-up of the funds? If the LNER scheme was making a considerably greater surplus than the Brighton scheme, and the Government considered that it was fair to vary the projected 85 per cent.—15 per cent. split, that would cause considerable difficulties. Presumably the issue then to be determined would be whether the pension authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2069</span>
would prefer to go for a single overall principle, so that they did not have to negotiate each year the amount of the surplus in the fund. In such circumstances, it would be better to have a general understanding from the beginning, instead of continual negotiations in which both parties would be uncertain as to what the form would be and what would remain. So it would seem eminently sensible to determine a principle at the beginning.<br><br>
If the logic of that is accepted, I cannot understand why the Minister is reluctant to put the principle into the Bill. He said that he would give the matter further thought, but when my right hon. Friend pushed him to write into the Bill the implications of his remarks, the Parliamentary Secretary promptly said that he was not suggesting that whatever principle was agreed and whatever degree of flexibility was decided upon would be written into the Bill. If the parties to the negotiations—the pensions authorities on the one hand and the Government on the other—can agree a principle, why can it not be written into the Bill?<br><br>
It is a balance of judgment. The judgments the Minister has made about the funding of other pensions—for example, in the case of the National Freight Corporation—and the proportions to be made in 1981—I may be incorrect about that but he has made estimates of future liabilities—have been once-and-for-all decisions. Those decisions related to liabilities that might be left with pension authorities. The Minister said, "I make this judgment now and you must learn to live with it. I believe that it is as fair as you were treated under the 1974 Act because those amounts are based on the same principle." The problem there was in judging what would happen to inflation, wages and the earning capacity of investment returns. The Minister says that he still believes that the principle is right and that people will not be treated less fairly than under the other system.<br><br>
Unfortunately, only the Government hold that view. Everyone else holds the contrary view and is concerned. We have debated that. But the Minister believes that it is right to make a judgment now about what is to happen 20 years hence. The least that can be done is to allow a judgment to be made and to be written into the Bill.<br><br>
We, therefore, press him to undertake not necessarily to make a decision straight
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2070</span>
away, but to look at the matter and to give an indication by Report stage. The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to say that the Government have no intention of writing such a provision into the Bill. That would be a fair request, as there has been a lot of thinking aloud on this clause.<br><br>
Finally, the Parliamentary Secretary made the point that the principle in regard to treatment of surpluses is the same under the Bill as under the 1974 legislation. Under the 1974 legislation, the Government had a clause to withdraw the surplus up to and including, I think, 1979. After 1979 the Government could withdraw no money, but before that they could assess whether there was a surplus in the fund. If too great a commitment had been made the taxpayer could then claw back the money. But after the final payments in 1981 under the existing scheme the Government would be free of liabilities or surplus. One would have to face one's own liabilities and one would benefit from one's own surpluses.<br><br>
The difference with this scheme is that, as I understand it, the Government will assess each time that there is a surplus, and take the surplus all the time, but they will necessarily meet the liabilities. On the basic scheme, if the liabilities occur, after the principles have been established, those liabilities will fall to the pension board, and if it fails to meet them, either the benefits will be reduced, or British Rail will have to finance them out of whatever capital remains after investment. A nationalised industry will knock at the Government's door, as it has before, saying "We have pension liabilities, and we feel that you have some responsibility for them."<br><br>
Presumably, unless British Rail is prepared to use its limited capital—unless its situation changes in the next decade—the pension fund will have to compete for resources from the British Railways Board with its investment in engines or other items.<br><br>
We do not accept that it is exactly the same principle. The Government are reserving the right continually to claw back surpluses without necessarily funding the liabilities which the pension authorities will have to meet on the basis of the principles determined in these clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend in making this criticism of the provision. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2071</span>
Government say, on the one hand, that the provision is fair and reasonable, and that they have the competence to make a one-off speculation about the rate of inflation, the rate of investment return and the likely rate of increase in public sector pensions for the purposes of clause 45. They will not commit themselves to paying out extra money if their calculations are wrong.<br><br>
On the other hand, in clause 47 they say they want continually to claw back money if the pension schemes get into surplus. Not only do they want to claw it back, they will not dare—in this case where they are actually getting money—to make a one-off assessment. They will have to do it by a process of continuous review. It seems that the contrast between those two approaches—of paying out money on one hand, and looking to receive it on the other—is both unfair and ludicrous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept immediately that this is a complicated clause, but I think that the intention is now fully understood by the Committee. As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said, a number of the old schemes paying basic pensions are now in surplus or may be expected to move into surplus. In the ordinary course of events, a surplus would stand to be distributed among pensioners. Various factors may contribute to the emergence of a surplus in a scheme. In the case of these particular old schemes, the principal factor has undoubtedly been inflation. As the benefits paid out under the scheme are fixed in money terms, the assets are likely to increase much faster than the liabilities, particularly at times of high inflation and high interest rates. I do not think that there is any dispute about that.<br><br>
Having considered the problem in some detail, I take the view that it is therefore right that a substantial proportion of the surpluses in the schemes paying the basic pension should be used to offset the cost of supplementation. Clause 47 is concerned with that. I fully understand the arguments adduced by the Opposition. As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said, it could be argued that the whole of any surplus should be used to meet the cost of supplementation, on the grounds that a surplus which is primarily consequent upon inflation should be used to offset costs attributable to inflation, and that it would be inappropriate to distribute the surpluses in any other way so long
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2072</span>
as pensioners and prospective pensioners stand to receive the benefits of supplementation for which they are not paying and have not paid contributions. However, as my hon. Friend and the Opposition have made clear, representations have been made to me that surpluses could be attributed to other causes. We have therefore sought to meet that point. We have made it clear that we have in mind that 15 per cent. of the surpluses concerned should be allowed to be used in improvements to other benefits and the remaining 85 per cent. to offset the cost of supplementation.<br><br>
In addition, officials at the Ministry are willing and ready to explore further with the board and the management committees precisely how this should work, and in particular whether some formula might be devised which would reflect the fact that different schemes have differing proportions of pensioners and serving members.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, (Mr. Prescott) raised the question of writing this arrangement into the Bill. If that is the wish of the Opposition, and if they believe that that would be to the benefit of pensioners, I can certainly give an undertaking that we would seek to do that at a later stage, probably on Report. The hon. Gentleman made a fair point, and I gladly give that undertaking.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said, this is in no way a worsening of the 1974 arrangements. Moreover, the kind of index-linking provided for pensioners in BR pension schemes at the moment is a considerable asset that many people in other schemes and other situations would dearly like. I therefore hope, in view of the undertaking that I have given, that the Opposition will be content to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
